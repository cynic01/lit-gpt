There is no coherent continuation or relevant response to the initial question, and the context is neither maintained nor advanced.\n\nThe repeated mention of 'Nasdaq' is particularly jarring as it does not connect to the previous dialogue at all. It seems like a non-sequitur, suggesting a breakdown in context maintenance. The dialogue does not provide any background or reason for discussing Nasdaq, and the repetition of the word in itself does not contribute to any meaningful conversation.

The initial context is a request for a summary about Michael Jackson, and a relevant response would be a concise statement or information about his life, career, or impact. However, the response given is repetitive and nonsensical, consisting only of the phrase \"I know\" repeated excessively. This does not address the context in any meaningful way and fails to provide a summary or any information at all about Michael Jackson. The repetition suggests a possible error in the dialogue system's response generation, possibly due to a loop or glitch in the system. This indicates a complete breakdown in context maintenance, as the response does not adhere to the topic or the conversational flow expected in a dialogue.",
