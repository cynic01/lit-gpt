The first symbolic grammars appeared in the 1970s and were extremely powerful. However, this period saw a decline in the number of computing jobs, and in the 1980s, the number of computing jobs declined dramatically. \n\nSome of the most important contributions to the field of computing women in computing include:\n* Rationalisation of programming languages: Women in computing have contributed greatly to the rationalisation of programming languages. The first rationalisation of programming languages, the Lisp, was published by Michael Spivak. Lisp was originally developed by Ray Kurzweil in the 1970s. By the early 1980s, women in computing were working in an increasingly large number of technical roles, so that by the late 1980s, women were working in technical fields other than computer science.\n* Complexity and efficiency: Women in computing have contributed to the development of algorithms that are both faster and more efficient. \n\nComplexity in computing stems from the use of computers for many tasks. These include solving problems using algorithms, such as heuristics and fuzzy searching. However, in many cases, these applications are limited by the hardware. For example, a digital computer uses a very large amount of memory, and generally, the amount of memory available for a computer increases with the number of processors it has. \n\nIn addition to the use of hardware for many tasks, women are also increasingly using these computing resources for other purposes. These include serving as a host for network servers, running databases, and providing computing power to other computing resources. The use of computing resources for these purposes is growing rapidly, and has contributed to the development of new paradigms of computing.\n", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

Golfers swing more easily with a golf iron than with a golf driver. A golf driver is often in use for both playing and hitting. Golfers swing with a golf driver because it's easier to reach the ball with the grip on the inside of the grip. A golf iron is typically used for hitting the ball from a position away from the body, away from the opponents line and away from the line of fire. Golfers swing with their hands more than with a golf driver. One difference is the grip on the inside of the grip is wider and more comfortable. Golfers who swing a golf iron have to unscrew the wood from the shaft, and then put the wood back together. As a result, the grip on the inside of the grip is wider. This wider grip allows the driver to be more effective to hit the ball from farther away, away from the opponents line and away from the line of fire. A golf driver is typically used with a driver.
