What is the Premier League?,The Premier League is the top division of English football. It is the oldest and most prestigious football league in the country.,"The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888; however, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky: from 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively. The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.

Can you help me avoid credit card debt?,"There are many ways you could try to avoid credit card debt, including paying off your balances in full each month, not using your credit card for everyday purchases, and only using your credit card for big purchases, such as a big ticket item or a balance transfer.  You can also try to change your spending habits, such as only using your credit card for big purchases when you have sufficient funds in your account.

What are good tips to drive in the snow?,"If you're driving in the snow, always drive defensively. There are many instances where a car can get stuck in the snow, but it's very difficult to tell if that's the case until you start crunching. Here are some tips to drive safely in the snow:

1. Slow down. When you're driving in the snow, you want to keep your speed below 20 MPH. This is because if you hit a patch of snow that's been disturbed, it will compact quite easily. This will make it harder for the snow to hold and will cause it to pack down even more when you start to move. This means you'll start to sink into the snow. If you hit a patch of compacted snow when you're moving at higher speeds, you could find yourself sliding into a tree or other object.

2. Turn on your headlights. It's important to always have at least one light on when you're driving in the snow. This will help you see what's around you and can help you avoid other vehicles that might have gotten stuck in the snow.

3. Avoid drinking and driving. Drinking and driving can be very dangerous in the snow. Alcohol can decrease your reaction time and make it harder to see what's around you.","Driving in the snow can be a fun experience but it can be equally dangerous. Always prepare a medical kit and a bag of supplies such as potable water bottles, imperishable items, and a radio in case of emergencies. Make sure your vehicle has four wheel traction, and if necessary, install snow chains on the tires.

How do you subtract two numbers?,"In math, there are two ways to subtract two numbers.  You could first subtract the smallest number from each number.

However, there is another way, which is to subtract the second number from the first.  Then take the difference between those two numbers, and that is your result.  For example, subtracting 8 from 11 would yield 3.  This is called ""left to right"" subtraction.","Subtraction is an operation that identifies the total count of objects in a collection of items after a specific count of items are removed from the starting total.

You can subtract two numbers by starting with an initial count, which represents the number to subtract from, and a second count which represents the number to subtract.  Then remove one from the starting count repeating this operation for the number of items in the subtract value.  

Subtraction is not associative, which means that the order in which subtraction is performed matters.  For instance, seven minus five (7 - 3) equals four (= 4) but four minus seven (4 - 7) equals minus three (= -3).",0.877663,0.996165,8.97848,0.95989,0.901389,2.542717,-4.224213600158691

The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information.

How do I make good pour over coffee?,"To make good pour over coffee all you need are:
- coffee beans
- a fine mesh coffee filter
- a fine mesh strainer
- some water
- your pour over machine
- a glass carafe or similar container

To start you will need to grind your coffee beans to a fine powder. Then you will need to brew your coffee. This can be done a few ways. You can use   the pour over machine to brew your coffee. This is the most common way. You can also brew your coffee in a coffee maker. Coffee makers are not as common these days, but they are a great option if you have a slow drip coffee maker. Finally you can use your ground coffee in a French press. These are less common than pour over machines and coffee makers, but a lot of people love them. To make the coffee pour over, all you need to do is fill the filter with your ground coffee then pour your brewed coffee into the filter. You will then need to put the filter over the top of your fine mesh strainer. Then you will need to put the strainer over the carafe or similar container. Next you will need to fill the carafe or similar container with water. Then you will need to put the lid on the carafe or similar container. Finally you will need to set your pour over machine to the pour over function. You will then be ready to make good pour over coffee.","Start with a good pour over filter holder, preferably one made of borosilicate glass, and filters especially designed for pour over coffee, such as cone filters. Use a medium-coarse grind of coffee beans, and use filtered water instead of regular tap water. The recommended ratio for coffee to water is 1:15, which means for every 1 gram of coffee, use 15 grams of water. Pour the water over the ground coffee in a circular motion, with a first pour just wetting the coffee grounds, and a second pour slow and steady until to reach the correct ratio.

The term pan-genomics was first coined by Eric Green of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2005. The technique is now widely used in research. Large-scale whole-genome sequencing projects are ongoing, including the UK10K, EU-AIMS, UK10K, UK10K, UK10K and UK BioBank 60K projects.","Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum, etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study.

Which is better - skiing or snowboarding,Both are great activities that can be done at any time of the year. Snowboarding is a more aggressive form of skiing where the rider goes down a hill on snowboards. A snowboarder goes down a hill with their hands on the snowboard and goes against a snowboarder riding down the hill on skis. Snowboarding is more of a stunt sport and skiing is more of a traditional skiing sport.,"I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. 

Expediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.",0.597088,0.997579,3.993043,0.927132,0.620403,1.427049,-3.18267822265625

They also develop new skills based on the content of the books. For example, they will learn how the human body works if you read them books about body parts; they will understand emotions better if you introduce them to cute picture books on feelings.  A good children's story should have repetition, relatable characters, and predictability. The story of Goldilocks, the three little pigs, Jack and the beanstalk, and Charlie and the chocolate factory are some good examples. If kids can recite the stories or rephrase them to others, they have learned to express themselves!",0.78474,0.999077,23.74393,0.945599,0.840159,5.462701,-3.6817641258239746

What should I consider before taking a job with a lot of travel?,"A lot of travel can be challenging for a variety of reasons.  The first thing to consider is if the job will fit with your lifestyle.  For example, a job in construction or manufacturing will likely involve a lot of travel, whereas a job in customer service or an office will likely not.  The next question to ask is if the travel will be necessary.  For example, if the job requires the employee to be on the other side of the country, the travel can be beneficial, but if the employee is only traveling a few times a year, that may not be necessary.  The third question is: is this a good opportunity for the employee?  For example, if the employee is a new employee and has little experience with travel, it may not be a great opportunity.  The final question is: is this a good opportunity for the company?  If the company is growing and there are not enough employees in the area to meet demand, the travel may not be necessary and could actually hinder growth for the company.","Many people are attracted to jobs that have significant travel.  The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?  The list can go on and on and is different for each person.  But it is critical to evaluate",0.687495,0.999093,8.506345,0.944907,0.769054,2.381379,-3.427987813949585

What is the Pandemis corylana,"The Pandemis corylana, the Red-veined White, is a species of moth in the family Noctuidae. It is found from British Columbia to the Yukon, south to Florida and Texas, and south to Bolivia and Brazil. It is found in the mountains, particularly on the Fraser River in the west.

The wingspan is 28–34 mm. Adults are on wing from May to August in one generation in the southern part of the range, but at least as late and in two generations in the north. There is one generation per year in the south and two to three generations per year in the north.

The larvae feed on Vaccinium and Prinus species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a blotch and then wraps around the midrib. Young larvae also create a lower, lateral tract. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.

What are some things to remember when buying a new pair of headphones?,"There are a few things to keep in mind when buying new headphones. First, make sure you are comfortable with the sound signature of the headphones you want to buy. How loud are they? How clear are the highs and lows? The bass doesn't always have to be thumping, in fact it can be muffled in some headphones. Don't assume you won't like something just because it sounds like the headphones you are used to. Second, look at reviews and ratings of headphones. There are online shops like Amazon that allow you to search for headphones and see reviews from other customers. If you see a lot of bad reviews, it could be a sign that the headphones don't sound good. Third, make sure the headphones are compatible with your devices. Some headphones only work with one type of device, some only with another, and some work with multiple devices. This will make sure you can listen to your music on your phone and in the car.","There are many criteria when one can keep in mind when purchasing headphones.

3. Active Noise cancellation (ANC): Although noise cancellation is coming with most headsets nowadays, the quality of ANC might vary from one piece to another. So it's always good to read some reviews around it.
4. Mobile application and features: It is almost a norm now that every major headset company has developed the corresponding mobile application with some add-on features. But some companies offer much for fine-grained controls than others.
5. Carry case: If you are a frequent traveller, then a compact and robust headset carry case might be good to have in certain situations.",0.534038,0.999346,11.850113,0.80465,0.737617,2.985153,-3.2165310382843018

"Some families get rid of TVs and smartphones for the proper growth of children, but are those things desirable?","Yes, the right amount of technology in children is good.

The children should be able to focus on their own things and not have a constant stream of media coming at them.

Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.  Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.,"Institutions are the glue that hold society together. Without them, people would have little reason to follow a common set of rules or norms. Our current economic system is institutions based. Businesses are the primary institution that create wealth and economic stability. It is critical that those who lead and manage businesses create and enforce institutions that create long term value. 

Similar to the way parents raise their children, the best way to raise a business is to be a good parent. We want to see our children succeed. We want to see that they have a bright future. We want to be able to send them to the same schools and colleges. A similar scenario exists for businesses. It is important that we want our companies to be successful. We want to see them succeed. It is critical that we create environments that create long term value for our companies. For that to happen, we need to be good stewards of capitalism.

To be a good steward of capitalism, it is critical to understand how capitalism creates the institutions that create stability and long term value. Jonathan Haidt has written extensively on this topic. It is important to understand how institutions are created. People create institutions when they follow a set of common rules and norms that help to create stability and order. People who act in ways that violate the rules and norms are ostracized by other members of the group. This creates incentives to behave in ways that are in line with the rules and norms. In a group with a shared set of institutions, people will be more likely to act in ways that are consistent with the shared set of institutions. There is greater stability in a group that follows a shared set of institutions. Because of this shared set of institutions, people are less likely to act in ways that are out of line with the shared set of institutions.

It is critical for managers and leaders to understand how to create institutions that create stability and long term value. The institutions that create stability and long term value are capitalism. Capitalism creates institutions that incentivize people to behave in ways that are in line with the rules of capitalism. The rules of capitalism incentivize people to engage in activity that creates economic stability and long term value. Capitalism creates institutions that create stability and long term value. It is critical that business leaders create and enforce institutions that create long term value. It is critical that leaders create institutions that create","To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to 
those relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs.

1. Limit multitasking: While it may feel more productive, you can easily get distracted and spend more time on those tasks overall. Instead, try to complete one task to a higher standard in less time.
2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.

"Vanessa and Lauren are both 32-year-old women with different levels of exercise experience. Vanessa, who weighs 124 lbs, has lifted weights before but Lauren, who weighs 166 lbs, has never participated in resistance training. Both women participate in initial fitness assessments and want your advice about starting a muscular fitness program at your exercise facility. Choose a different test to measure each woman's upper body muscular strength. Briefly explain the procedures for each assessment. What common errors should you watch for?","For people who are new to lifting weights, the bench press is a good exercise to start with. To perform the bench press exercise, you need to lie on your back on a bench and lift a weight that's within your ability range from the bench with both arms. For the bench press, you'll look your subject in the eyes, and you'll use a calibrated scale to measure your subject's upper body muscular strength. Next, you'll perform a maximum repetition test. To do this test, you'll start with your subject standing with their hands on the edge of a bench and you'll slowly lower the bench until your subject can't sustain the weight any longer. Next, you'll have your subject perform as many repetitions in one set as they can without a break. For the next test, you'll perform a bench press with a loaded barbell. For this test, you'll start with a loaded barbell and lift the barbell off the bench with a maximum weight. The third test you'll perform is a 1-repetition maximum test. For this test, your subject will perform one repetition as quickly as they can with a loaded barbell. The final test you'll perform is one-repetition max with an empty barbell. For this test, your subject will perform 1 repetition as quickly as they can with an empty barbell. In the final test, you'll determine the weight the subject can lift by using a calibrated scale.","For Vanessa, we’ll choose for her to perform a one-rep max assessment, specifically with the bench press. This is because she has experience with lifting weights. To start, she should warm up by completing several submaximal repetitions. We’re going to select an initial weight of 50-70% of her capacity, and progressively increase resistance by 2.5 to 20 kg until the subject cannot complete the repetitions. The final weight lifted should be the absolute 1-RM. Some common error we want to watch for is to make sure that the repetitions are performed at the same speed of movement and range of motion to ensure consistency.

"In football, if touchdowns is the main way to get points, why can't the quarterback always throw the ball to the end zone every time?","There are many reasons that this is not how most competitions work. Here are two:

1. It would be too easy and boring for everyone else on the team.
2. There is a limit to how many points can be scored in a game.

In many competitions, the team with the most points at the end of the game wins. In football, the game goes for a longer time and the scores can get very high very quickly. So in football, the team that scores the most points in the allotted time wins.","To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. 
At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard.",0.945465,0.992859,5.867781,0.74416,0.947834,1.89962,-4.749429225921631

If the p-value is small, then there is little probability to observe the result if the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is large, then there is a high probability to observe the result if the null hypothesis is true.","In statistics, a p-value is used to test the significance of the hypothesis. It indicates the probability that the results were obtained by chance alone. A small p-value indicates that it is very unlikely that the observed result came about by chance. 
However, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial. Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis.",0.88436,0.998135,4.9648,0.98613,0.896004,1.745886,-2.788010358810425

Aldrin served as the second person to walk on the moon during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Aldrin is one of the eight Apollo astronauts to walk on the moon, and the third person to do so as part of the Apollo 11 mission. Aldrin is most well known for his role as the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 11 mission and for being the second human to step onto the lunar surface. Aldrin's experience on the moon was memorable due to his role as the lunar module pilot for the Apollo 11 mission. Aldrin performed the first human steps onto the lunar surface, and went on to plant America's flag on the lunar surface and perform other activities. Aldrin's role on the Apollo 11 mission was considered amongst the most important ever because it was the first manned mission to land on the moon and bring the remaining astronauts safely back to Earth. Aldrin's role on the Apollo 11 mission is also remembered for being one of the most famous images from the Apollo 11 mission, which depicts Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the lunar surface. Aldrin's role on the Apollo 11 mission is also considered one of the most significant moments in the history of space exploration due to the fact that the Apollo 11 spacecraft was the first spacecraft to leave the Earth's gravitational field. Aldrin's role on the Apollo 11 mission is also remembered for being one of the most difficult missions for the astronauts as they faced numerous challenges during their journey to the moon. Aldrin's role on the Apollo 11 mission is also remembered for being one of the most famous images from the Apollo 11 mission, which depicts Buzz Aldrin standing on the Moon's surface with the American flag.

Aldrin's experience on the moon is also remembered for being memorable because he was an astronaut and rock climber.","Buzz Aldrin, the second person to step onto the Moon's surface after Neil Armstrong, had a unique experience during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Like Armstrong, Aldrin spent just over two hours outside the lunar module, conducting experiments and collecting samples.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was both exhilarating and challenging. He described the lunar landscape as ""magnificent desolation,"" with vast, barren plains and towering mountains in the distance. Aldrin also noted the difficulty of moving around in the bulky spacesuit and the constant hissing sound of his oxygen supply.

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration.

Will getting a vaccine in a clinic (such as minute clinics) result in charges?","Minute clinics are a type of health care provider that offers a range of services, including vaccines, for a flat monthly fee.  They are independent of any insurance company, but some clinics provide insurance reimbursement. There are also some clinics that require a co-pay for vaccines, but do not charge a visit fee. In some cases, the exact fee charged by a clinic is unknown, as clinics are not required to disclose their fee structure.","The main difference between getting a vaccine at a clinic and a pharmacy comes down to the setting and the potential fees involved.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.
A pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.

Fees:
Both clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.

Describe how skateboarding teaches you about life and to be resilient.,"Skateboarding teaches you to be resilient. You have to embrace the bad times, and learn to bounce back quickly. There are plenty of setbacks in life, especially for someone who starts skateboarding at a young age. There's a quote that says ""Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you deal with it."" Skateboarding taught me that you have to embrace the bad and keep moving.","Skateboarding has been through quite an evolution since its first inception, when it came from the waves to the street. As a sport, skateboarding has always had a special attitude towards rules and pushed boundaries. Think of where one is supposed to skate (in the park) and where the best spots can actually be found across town (particularly where it's forbidden). In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved. As humbling and painful as falling onto plain asphalt can be, it can also stimulate resilience and a relieving patience when the goal is in sight.

What are the different ways I can open a jar whose lid is stuck and will not open?,"There are several ways to open a jar whose lid is stuck and will not open.  The best option is to use a can opener.  Other options include:

Using a flat head screwdriver to carefully pry the lid open, avoiding moving the jar's base or spinning the jar.  If you are willing to take a risk, you can use a regular screwdriver to pry the lid open.  Avoid using the flat side of the screwdriver to avoid damaging the lid's finish.
Use a can opener to cut through the metal ring at the top of the jar.  The ring is usually 1/4"" thick and is welded to the jar's lid.  You can use a can opener with a cutting blade or a can opener with a serrated edge.  No matter which option you decide to use, be sure to use the proper can opener for the size of the ring you cut open.  A can opener with a cutting blade will not work on a ring with a weld.  A can opener with a serrated edge will work on a ring with a weld but may make a loud sound and could damage the ring.
Use a bucket or other container with a cover to heat the jar.  Place the jar on top of the container and cover the jar.  Use a hair dryer or hot plate to heat the jar until the ring melts.  Do not use a microwave oven or stove top to heat the jar because these devices can cause the ring to heat the jar too quickly, causing the ring to melt.  The jar must be completely covered with a lid so that heat does not escape and the ring melts.  Avoid placing the jar above a flame or on top of a hot stove or other heat source because the jar's heat can cause the ring of the lid to melt.
Use a heat gun or hair dryer to heat the lid.  Use caution when using a heat gun or hair dryer to heat the lid because the heat can cause the metal ring to melt.  Place the jar on a flat surface and place the lid on top of the jar.  Use a hair dryer or heat gun set on the lowest heat setting or to heat the lid for 30 seconds.  After the lid is heated, remove it from the jar and carefully slide the heated lid into the jar.  If you are unable to carefully slide the heated lid into the jar, hold the lid up to the jar's lid ring and use","1. Using a rubber band or rubber glove - Surround the circumference of the lid with a rubber band and now try to open the lid the same way you would normally do. The rubber band creates additional friction which causes helps open the lid with less force. The same result can be achieved by using rubber glove. 
2. Using hot water - Hold the jar under hot water, the hot water will allow the metal lid to expand allowing you to open the jar. 
3. Using a knife - Break the vacuum seal by poking a hole in the lid using a sharp object such as a knife. Once the vacuum seal is broken, you can twist open the lid with less force.",0.114061,0.998781,22.86974,0.974039,0.171725,5.025669,-3.9515609741210938

How is it that some high net-worth individuals are able to avoid paying taxes completely?,"There are a number of strategies that high net-worth individuals use to reduce income and the tax burden and many of these strategies are legal.  There are a number of deductions available to high net-worth individuals that reduce income on the front-end.  One important deduction is the mortgage interest deduction, which allows individuals to deduct the interest on their primary residence.  Even if you live in an apartment, you can claim the mortgage interest deduction on your primary residence.  This can significantly reduce taxable income.  Another important deduction is the deduction for charitable contributions.  Even if you are not a 501(c)(3) organization, you can deduct the total fair market value of property you donate to charity.  Because of this, high net-worth individuals are able to significantly reduce their taxable income by donating large sums to charity.  In addition, high net-worth individuals are able to reduce taxable income by deducting state and local taxes, as well as property taxes.  This is because high net-worth individuals can reduce their taxable income by depreciating assets.  For example, a high net-worth individual can depreciate a personal residence by reducing the property’s market value, rather than maintaining its fair market value.  This depreciation, which reduces the property’s taxable basis, reduces the overall taxable income.  When depreciating assets, high net-worth individuals can also deduct the cost of improvements to the property, as well as the cost of any improvements to the property if they are made to improve the utility of the property.  In addition, high net-worth individuals can deduct any losses they experience, such as investments that are not profitable.  High net-worth individuals can also reduce taxable income by using a variety of strategies that reduce income on the back-end.  The most common strategies that high net-worth individuals use to reduce taxable income are the creation of entities and foreign tax-exiles.  High net-worth individuals may also engage in transactions such as the sale of businesses and interests in businesses.  There are many other strategies high net-worth individuals can use to reduce taxable income, such as the use of trusts, foundation investments, and the use of offshore bank accounts.  Even if high net-worth individuals want to reduce taxable income without reducing taxable income on the front-end, they may be able to do so by using a trust or foundation.  In general, trusts and foundations are able to reduce taxable income on the back-end without reducing taxable income on the","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes regular income and investment income differently. For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all.",0.098262,0.996709,19.584942,0.981958,0.140669,4.360508,-3.603193521499634
How is the white color created?,White color is created by mixing powder coating colors.,"The color white is created when all colors in the visible spectrum are combined in equal amounts. This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

In the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity. This creates a pure white color on electronic displays.",0.786658,0.99325,0.999134,0.056968,0.764584,0.720119,-4.720475196838379

Please summarize the causes and cure for color blindness given in the passage?,"Color blindness is a condition in which color perception is impaired. Color vision deficiency can be congenital, acquired, or hereditary. Congenital color blindness results from a genetic mutation that causes the cones in the eye to not develop properly. This results in the inability to perceive color. Acquired color blindness occurs when the brain has not fully developed, so that the young child is unable to perceive color. Hereditary color blindness is much rarer, and occurs when a person inherits two copies of a gene that either produces the protein responsible for the red/green color cones, or does not produce any such protein, meaning there is color blindness.","The most common cause of color blindness is genetic disorder. Males are more likely to be color blind than females, because the genes responsible for the same are present on the X chromosome. Females who are non-color blind could still carry and pass on genes for color blindness. Any kind of physical or chemical damage to the eye, optic nerve or brain could also lead to the same.

There is no cure for color blindness. Affected people can actively accommodate the condition or use special glasses or lenses that can help people with red-green color blindness to a certain extent. There are mobile apps available as well to help identify colors.",0.896455,0.99903,5.985375,0.936371,0.904749,1.944396,-3.879214286804199

What is the key to longevity?,Keeping a positive attitude and eating healthy food is the key to longevity.,"Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery.

In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in",0.953134,0.997191,1.945862,0.061828,0.94889,0.981381,-3.6084508895874023
Why are kids inquisitive?,"Kids are generally inquisitive. They are curious about many things, and are always trying to find out more about the world around them. They love to learn and are always trying to find out more. When they are young, they have limited information and often ask why. As they get older, they start to ask questions like how or why. They might even start to try to figure things out for themselves to learn more. It is this curiosity that makes them such a joy to be around.","As kids grow and have a sense of the world around them, they tend to be eager to understand the meaning of everything and events. In most cases, their primary source of information is the adults around them, usually their mom and data, hence they ask 'why' on a lot of things and events. This not only develops their intellectual skills, but also their social skills. It is worth mentioning that there could be several developmental and/or cognitive factors that affect this trait in some kids.",0.178315,0.994581,6.966488,0.933654,0.234477,1.861503,-2.927774667739868

What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"A genome-wide association study is a type of genetic study that takes advantage of the vast amount of data available in modern genomic sequencing technologies, e.g. whole genome sequencing, to look for regions of the genome that are linked to a particular trait or disease.","In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease.

Write down some key points for the poem Garshasp-nama based on the given text.,"Garshasp-nama is a poem written by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (1750–1834) in 1795. Naser al-Din Shah was the Safavid Shah of Persia (Iran) from 1786 to 1795. The poem was written after the defeat of the Persian army by the Ottoman empire in the battle of Garshasp in 1622.

In the poem, Garshasp is the Persian name of the Ottoman Sultan, Osman I. Garshasp is also an epithet of an eagle, the traditional enemy of the Iranians.

The poem starts with a prologue in which the narrator explains the circumstances leading to the defeat of the Iranians and ends with a series of reflective verses.

The main theme of the poem is the defeat of the Persians at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. The defeat is explained by the narrator as follows: ""The shield of the eagle Fateh-ed-Din was broken, / The eagle's wings were clipped, / The eagle was deprived of teeth, / And was made to eat the heart of the victorious one"".

The defeat is then explained as follows: ""The great eagle was defeated by a mouse / He was defeated by a mouse, O mouse!"".

How does the Stock Market work?,The Stock market is a form of capital market.,"The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.",0.627754,0.93491,0.992364,0.404028,0.615573,0.714926,-3.1408355236053467

The larger the ORP'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.

What is the United States Bill of Rights?,"The United States Bill of Rights (US Bill of Rights) is a list of amendments to the United States Constitution. It was adopted by the Second Continental Congress on July 2, 1776 at the Philadelphia Convention. The amendments are designed to protect the rights of individuals against the government of the newly independent states. The First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments are incorporated into the Bill of Rights by Article IV of the United States Constitution.

The first ten amendments are known as the original bill of rights, while the remaining eight are known as the post-ratification amendments. Of the original amendments, only the First and Fourth were adopted by states that had ratified the Constitution, while the rest were proposed by anti-constitutionalists and were never submitted to the states for ratification. The Bill of Rights was ratified by the required nine states within a year of its adoption. The first ten amendments were subsequently ratified by 38 states and the federal district within three years, and they have remained in effect since they were ratified.

The Bill of Rights was the subject of a great deal of controversy between 1789 and 1800, when it was part of the widely debated Federalist or Anti-Federalist positions. The Bill of Rights was a primary factor in the American Revolution and the onset of the United States' independence. It has influenced major decisions on constitutional interpretation, including Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Roe v. Wade (1973), and the Miranda rights (1966). The Bill of Rights is also sometimes considered a foundational document for the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s.

The Bill of Rights was adopted on July 2, 1789, during the Second Continental Congress. The First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech and of the press, became effective on September 3, 1789. The Second Amendment, which guarantees the right to bear arms, was ratified on February 4, 1803 and became effective on September 14, 1803. The Third Amendment, which prohibits the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, was ratified on July 2, 1791 and became effective on February 6, 1801. The Fourth Amendment was ratified on September 25, 1789, and became effective on February 5, 1621. The Fifth Amendment was ratified on September 25, 1789 and became effective on March 4, 1868. The Ninth Amendment was ratified on July 2, 1789, and became effective on September 25, 1789.","The United States Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the often bitter 1787–88 debate over the ratification of the Constitution and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those in earlier documents, especially the Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776), as well as the Northwest Ordinance (1787), the English Bill of Rights (1689), and the Magna Carta (1215).",0.695453,0.998867,18.576372,0.985626,0.717177,4.394699,-3.349982976913452
Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?,"Learning piano on a keyboard is just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano, but there are many benefits to learning on a keyboard.

First, there is a larger variety of keys and the range of notes they can play.  Practicing on a keyboard allows you to focus on specific areas of your skill set rather than spending a lot of time on playing all the notes in the entire piano keyboard.

Second, you can practice on your own, in your home and at your own convenience.  Learning piano on a keyboard  is ideal for those with busy schedules or those who do not have the time or space for a full sized piano.

Third, many keyboards are portable meaning a student can bring their piano to a lesson to practice on.  This can be a great option for those who do not have a full size piano or the space to practice on one in their home.","Since the layout of keys for both electronic keyboards and pianos are the same, keyboards could be effective for beginners. However, Pianos have more “action” than keyboards (i.e. how the keys feel when pushed down, whether they are light or heavy).

This can produce a loud bang, like a pistol shot, followed by a loud thud, like a body hitting the floor.","Water hammer is the often counterintuitive result of stopping water that is in motion in a fluid system; the collective momentum of the water acts as a ""hammer"" and can create a high-pressure shockwave that damages, or destroys piping, valves, or equipment.

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"According to Venomizer, a website that tracks geopolitical, historical, and scientific events, the United States Congress passed a resolution in 1997 that declared Georgia to be part of the United States. Georgia was formerly part of the Soviet Union and before that, the Russian Empire, so it is easy to see why Georgia would be highly sought after by Hollywood studios.","While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

What and how should you feed your baby?,"The best advice to follow is based on your baby's age, dietary habits and the time of day. 
For example, for babies who are breastfed, you can offer:
- Breast milk
- Bottled milk 
- Formula
For babies who are formula-fed, you can offer:
- Bottled formula 
- Formula
For babies who are formula-free, you can offer:
- Bottled formula
- Fresh fruit and vegetables
- Warm water with a little breast milk","What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers.

What does the distribution of isobars indicate?,"The distribution of isobars is mainly used in the petroleum industry to determine the nature and location of reservoirs.  It is important to understand this in order to estimate the recoverable reserves of petroleum.  Reservoirs are defined as areas of a formation that contain oil or gas in sufficient quantities to be economically viable to produce.  Isobars are defined as the vertical separation between the oil and gas fluids in a reservoir.  These are determined by drilling one or more wells into the reservoir and measuring the properties of the fluids from each well.  These properties include the density, specific gravity, viscosity, and API gravity.  From the data, the isobar curves are created which are used to show the relationship between the oil and gas fluids.  The intersection of these curves shows the location of the oil and gas from a reservoir.","The distribution of isobars is closely related to the magnitude and direction of the wind field, and can be used to predict future weather patterns.",0.873543,0.996876,7.166665,0.757772,0.887391,2.13645,-4.254493713378906

How can you take good star photos?,"The most important thing to take note is to make sure you're in the right place at the right time. If you're able to snap a picture of the star at a dark sky site, this will give a great photo with much less light pollution. If you're able to snap a picture of the star during a full moon (when the star is brightest), this will give a great photo with the moon as the star. The next step is to look at what settings will allow you to get a good photo. It's best to get a photo of the star against a dark background, so if you can, get a picture of the moon against the star. Then, use a zoom lens to get close to the star to get a better photo with the star as the main subject and the background as a background texture. Lastly, use a wide-aperture lens to get the star in focus. All of these things will help you get a decent photo of the star.","Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky",0.730543,0.997402,7.934477,0.900093,0.82269,2.277041,-2.890700101852417
I want to develop OKRs for my team at work. What process should I use?,"According to OKR.io, the best method is to assign an OKR to each member of your team. As you assign your OKRs, consider the following:

1. What is your team's most important goal? This might be to hit a specific milestone, or to improve performance metrics.
2. Where is your team currently? Are they close to their goal, or are they a ways off?
3. What is your team's skill set? Do they have the skills required to complete the OKR?
4. Who is responsible for achieving this goal? Do they have the skills to succeed?
5. What will be the consequences if you do not complete your OKR? If you do not complete your OKR, what will be the consequences if you fail?

Once you've assigned your OKRs, monitor your team's performance on them. As you see your team closer to their goal, celebrate and reward them. As you see your team fall off track, correct them.","Developing OKRs for your team is a useful way to identify what goals your team will focus on and provide specific, time-bound metrics you can use to measure your success. First, identify the most important objectives for your organization - usually no more than five. Next, identify your Key Results. These Key Results should follow the SMART principles. They should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Once you have identified both your objectives and key results, share them with your team for their input.

Give me a concise summary of the history of baseball,"Baseball is a sport that has a long and storied history. It all started in the late 19th century when teams from the East Coast played teams from the Midwest. Teams from the East Coast won the first professional game beating the team from the West Coast. Baseball slowly grew and in 1903 the rules were changed to add a different colored baseball to each team. This added a new element to the game and it started showing more interest from the general public. By the 1920's baseball was a popular sport that was played in every part of the country. It became so popular that it was a requirement for high school graduation. In 1903, the American Baseball League was founded and it was the first professional baseball league. The league lasted for 16 years before it folded. Baseball continued to grow and expand and by the 1950's over a billion baseballs were being sold.

They say it is special being a grandparent for a variety of reasons.  One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren.

Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment.

In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual.

What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?,"The brain is a symmetrical organ. There are two sections on each side that are mirror images of each other. These sections are called the right and left hemispheres. These hemispheres are joined together by a thin membrane known as the corpus callosum. The function of these hemispheres are different. On the right side, the left hemisphere is responsible for language, and the right hemisphere is responsible for visual-spatial skills, and right handedness. On the left, the left hemisphere is responsible for language, and the right hemisphere is responsible for visual-spatial skills, and left handedness.","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.18781,0.99866,6.974908,0.989033,0.236141,1.87731,-2.825585126876831
What is a bond in finance?,"A bond is a financial instrument that gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to pay the issuer a certain amount of money at a pre-determined interest rate in the future.","In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders).

If they’re not hungry, they’re possibly tired. Babies can become over tired and cry and fuss, even when you are just trying to get them to sleep. If this is the case you’ll need to calm them down first, and then you can get them to sleep.

Does a difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups from a credit scoring algorithm constitute a bias in the data collection process or the algorithm itself?,"No, but yes.","I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes.

What is Pullman National Historical Park?,"Pullman National Historical Park is in Northern Idaho, just north of the Canadian border. It was established in 1963 by an act of Congress. It protects the communities of Pullman, Washington, and Garden City, Washington, and the model city of Pullman, Washington. It is a National Historic Landmark and a National Historic Site, and is a part of the National Park System. The town of Garden City was also included, but has since been removed.

The model village of Pullman was built in the early twentieth century by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. It was intended to serve as a model community for communities that were not able to afford the cost of building their own railroads. It was a showcase for the latest innovations in architecture, engineering, and technology. It was intended to be a model of the future, and was a source of pride for the railroad's employees. It was also a source of pride for the residents of the surrounding area.

The community's economic prosperity only lasted about a decade, however. It was plagued by a succession of railroad bankruptcies, and was ultimately abandoned by the railroad in 1937. The community began to decline in the 1940s, and eventually became part of the larger region's poverty. By the 1960s, the community was on the verge of being annexed by the city of Spokane. Much of the community was destroyed in a fire in 1962, and the population of the community began to decline significantly. It never recovered, and eventually fell into decline as well. It remains a ghost town to this day.

The town of Pullman and the model village of Pullman are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are both part of the Pullman National Historical Park. The park also includes the community of Garden City, but that was never incorporated into the national park.","Pullman National Historical Park is a historic district located in Chicago and was the first model, planned industrial community in the United States. It was built for George Pullman as a place to produce the famous Pullman sleeping cars.The park was made a national monument by president Barack Obama on February 19, 2015. The district had its origins in the manufacturing plans and organization of the Pullman Company and became one of the most well-known company towns in the United States, as well as the scene of the violent 1894 Pullman strike. During the strike the American Railway Union led by Eugene V. Debs boycotted the company following the panic of 1893 crippling railroad traffic in the United States. Thousands of U.S marshals and army troops were deployed to break up the strike.

Your Citizen","The Covid19 pandemic has changed the lives of all human beings, and has driven massive consumption of personal protective equipment worldwide.

Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms.

Write a story about a toddler who woke up in the middle of the night after a nightmare about a monster under their bed.,"It was quiet in my house as I lay in bed, staring into the darkness. I could hear my parents breathing, but I was too tired to tell if they were sleeping. I lay awake for a long time, listening to the quiet. Then I heard it. The sound of my sister's little feet padding down the hallway to our room. She was three years old, and she couldn't have been more than four, but she never slept through the night. I could hear her softly opening our door, and then I could hear her voice, muffled by the thickness of her sleeping mask.

""Bri? Are you still awake?""

I sat up in bed and stretched, grumbling at the stiffness in my limbs. I could see the outline of my sister's bed, and her sleeping mask was pulled down over her eyes.

""Sorry, baby, I know you were trying to sleep, but I couldn't stop thinking about that monster under the bed. It was so real.""

""I'm trying, Bri. I promise."" I heard her sigh, and then I heard her say, ""But I _really_ don't want to sleep. I want to play a game in my room. Can you wake your mom and dad up?""

""Sure,"" I mumbled, and then I heard her laugh as I heard her say, ""I think I can wake them up, but I don't think I can wake them up _that_ sleepy.""

There was a pause, and then I heard her giggle and say, ""It's not fair. You're always so much better than me at sleeping.""

I laughed, too, and I heard my sister say, ""I'm not. I sleep just fine. It's you who can't stop thinking about the monster.""

Conventional music,"Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

How does the train work?,"The train has two types of electric locomotives, with AC or DC traction motors.

The locomotive keeps the train moving along a set of tracks, and the guard ensures that no one is left behind.","How Does An Electric Locomotive Work:
Electric locomotives use electricity from overhead wires to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, making them lighter, faster, and quieter than steam or diesel engines.


How Does a Diesel Locomotive Work:
Diesel-electric locomotives provide cheaper upfront costs and improved reliability.

Train wheels are conical, allowing them to travel a longer distance while turning at the same speed as the inner wheel. The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the ""flange"" of the wheel limiting lateral movement. Distance between tracks must be greater than wheel flanges to allow wheels to move laterally in curves, reducing efficiency and comfort.

Should I buy a gravel bike or a down country mountain bike?,The decision to buy a gravel bike or a mountain bike is a matter of personal preference and budget.  Gravel bikes are great for casual riding in the ocassional long distance ride and can also be used for commuting to work.  They are light weight and are easy to carry to the trailhead.  They are lower to the ground and can take some knocks.  Down country mountain bikes are great for riding long distance and can handle the abuse of a longer distance ride.

However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!).

What type of diet does Dr. Michael Greger advocate for?,"Dr. Greger advocates for a ""plant-based"" or ""paleo"" diet. According to him, the diet was developed to help treat diseases of modern civilization, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity. According to Dr. Greger, the reason this diet works is because plant-based foods are high in fiber, which slows the digestion of food and keeps food in your stomach longer, promoting regular bowel movements. This regular bowel movements help prevent constipation and intestinal permeability. Intestinal permeability is high in modern civilization because modern food is high in sugar, gluten, and additives to make it shelf-stable. High permeability is associated with obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. 

The diet also promotes getting your protein from plant-based foods, as opposed to animal-based foods, because animal-based foods contain high amounts of animal protein, which is linked to heart disease. Dr. Greger includes plenty of non-starchy vegetables and fruits on the diet, as well as whole grains and legumes, because these foods are also full of fiber and nutrients. For example, whole grains, such as brown rice, oatmeal, barley, quinoa, and millet, are high in fiber, which helps you feel full longer and keeps your bowels regular. Dr. Greger also states that cooking your own plant-based foods is easier than you might think. For example, he recommends roasting vegetables and making hummus.",Dr. Michael Greger advocates for a whole foods plant based diet.,0.561388,0.999537,9.672437,0.960078,0.687312,2.57615,-3.7903034687042236

The customer uses the cloud service provider's network and hardware to run their applications and are billed by the service provider for the resources used to run the applications.  You can think of the cloud service provider as the hosting service provider and the customer as the user of the service.",Imagine you are building some thing using lego pieces. All of your legos are in basket.  As you start to build your desired structure you start to take 1-3 or couple of handful of legos from the basket. As you start to give some shape to the structure you are designing you start to put back some of the legos into the basket you don't need. Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket). As your application needs compute resources to meet the demand; you borrow compute resources from the cloud providers data center and give it back when you don't need it.,0.906776,0.998648,6.876838,0.830178,0.912385,2.104965,-3.7108020782470703

Explain gravity,Gravity is the force that causes all objects to have equal speed in the same direction.,"Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.915113,0.961077,0.99347,0.697116,0.904731,0.894301,-3.181899070739746

Which part of the world do you find the most people bicycling?,"Bicycling is a great way to get around your community and even the country.  It is a great form of exercise and you can make new friends while you are out riding around.  This is because you are on a bicycle and the human body is not weighed down by bags and other items that are standard with cars and trucks.  You are essentially riding a skateboard on two wheels and balancing that on a bicycle.  The joy is in the activity of riding your bicycle and you will find new people to socialize with and enjoy the outdoors while bicycling.  That said, be aware that people on bicycles are part of your community and you should also be part of the community by bicycling.  Bicycling can be something that brings people together and when you do it in a safe and responsible way, it is a great way to get out and get exercise while making new friends.  If you are concerned about safety, you can always use lights and wear a helmet and a padded jacket.   This is something that can be learned by reading the blogs of people who are riding bicycles in your area of interest.  If you want to learn more about bicycling in your area of interest, you can find blogs on blogs.google.com or read books on your e-reader or in the library and join online communities where people can share their experiences and knowledge.  There are many communities on social media that allow community members to connect and share information.  For example, there is a community called ""Bikes in the Park"" where people can bring their bikes to a public space and enjoy riding them.  You can also find ""Biking Buddy"" groups on Facebook or some other social media platform, where you can find others who are interested in bicycling and enjoy riding bicycles together.  You can also find other people on bicycles in your area by joining a local cycling club.  The local cycling club is a good place to find others who enjoy bicycling and will be able to help you make wise decisions about bicycling.  The local cycling club will also be able to help with finding the best areas to ride your bicycle and rides to get you used to riding a bicycle.  You will be able to ask questions and make new friends while you are bicycling around your community and even the country.","Bicycling is a form of human powered movement that typically involves sitting or standing on a machine with two wheels that can be propelled forward by using one's arms or legs.

What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?,"- aperture (f-stop) - the size of the hole in the lens that controls the amount of light that passes through to an image sensor
- shutter speed - how fast the hole in the lens is open or closed
- ISO - the sensitivity of the image sensor to light
- ISO speed - the sensitivity of the image sensor to light - how well the image sensor can handle low light situations","If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.
1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.042885,0.993732,0.997495,0.968984,0.049308,0.610481,-5.164830207824707

"Write a friendly, convincing e-mail to my landlord asking whether I can get a dog.","Dear Mr. Smith:

It has been a pleasure working with you on this property. I am sure you have had many positive experiences with landlords and I look forward to working with you again in the future.

I have been thinking a lot about pets since we have moved in, and I would love to get a dog. I have been doing research and I think it would be great to have a furry friend. I would like to know whether I can get a dog and how much it would cost.

If I can get a dog, I would like to get a small dog. I have grown up with small dogs and they are great pets. I am interested in a dog that is friendly, but not necessarily friendly with all people. I also need a dog who will not need to be walked a lot because I work from home and I will be home most of the time.

If I am able to get a dog, I would like to know if it will be a female or male since I like to watch male dogs play. I am also not interested in a cat because I like to have more than one pet.

Please let me know if I can get a dog. Thank you,

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

P.S. I will be a responsible pet owner and make sure the dog is properly taken care of.","Dear landlord,

The algorithm involves the following steps:
1. A key is negotiated between the client and server.

3. The nonce is used to update the cipher state, which is done by the server.
4. The updated cipher state is provided to the client.
5. The client uses the cipher state to update a message authentication code (MAC) and send it to the server.
6. The server computes a MAC of the message and checks it against the MAC from the client. The result will be valid only if TLS was used to encrypt the message.

The order of the steps is usually the same as the TLS handshake, but they can be interleaved in any order.","AES-GCM is a mode of operation for symmetric-key cryptography.

Do aliens exist?,"The existence of extraterrestrial life is not yet confirmed. But, there are many evidences that some life form may exist in the universe. The first evidence of extraterrestrial life was reported by astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt in the 1930s. She noticed that the so-called ""flicker distance"" between stars was a constant integer times 10–15 seconds, instead of being variable. This was later found to be due to the time it takes for light to travel between stars. It was later discovered that the light from stars in our galaxy is ""redshifted"" when it traverses the universe, meaning it takes longer for light to reach us from the farther away stars. This ""redshift"" increases with time. The first evidence of extra-terrestrial life was reported by astronomer Carl Sagan in the 1980s. He and his colleagues claimed to have found chemical signatures of life on Mars.","Although there is no definitive evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life, pictures and videos of UFOs, although of low quality, have proven to many people that not only does extraterrestrial life exist, but it is visiting Earth regularly.",0.733984,0.996964,4.497835,0.953385,0.841973,1.604828,-3.6506268978118896

What steps can I take to avoid getting hit by a falling window from a skyscraper while walking about in downtown during high winds?,"If you are in downtown during high winds, and a window from a tall building is about to fall, you should run for cover or move to an area with a lower floor.","Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting hit by falling windows detached from tall building by strong winds from cyclones or tornadoes: 
1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. 
3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris.

The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).

It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions.

It is often viewed as a distinguishing difference between the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Christian denominations. Historically, this is why members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have been called Mormons.",0.438013,0.996157,9.811725,0.944843,0.49565,2.537278,-4.032321453094482

What is a quantum computer?,"A quantum computer is a machine that can be programmed with quantum mechanics to solve problems exponentially faster than a standard computer.  Until recently, it was not clear whether nature's quantum computers (those governed by quantum mechanics) actually exist, and therefore, this technology is still in the research stage.  The only quantum computer that has been built is the D-Wave machine.","A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.936849,0.998728,2.995087,0.703609,0.940963,1.315047,-3.780038595199585

What was the cause of MH370 flight's disappearance?,"The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines MH370 was caused by intentional downing by another party. The main clue was the debris found in the southern Indian Ocean.  Analysis of this debris showed that the plane's windows were covered with PVC sheet, a type of plastic which can be found in home appliances and cars.  PVC sheet was not found in Malaysia.  Indonesia had a large scale of PVC sheet production and had received subsidies from Malaysia.  Indonesia had a motive to cover up evidence of its involvement in the disappearance of MH370.  Indonesia had also purchased PVC sheet from Malaysia.  Indonesia had also expanded its port area to be able to receive larger aircraft.  Indonesia was able to downsize the plane to fit within its new port area.  The downsized plane would have a lower flight performance, but could be flown by a less experienced pilot, or in a weaker plane with a weaker engine.  Malaysia Airlines flight 370 had a Boeing 777, and this type of plane had a more powerful engine and a higher flight performance.  Indonesia's downsized plane would have been able to fly the plane for a longer time before being discovered.","There are many conspiracy theories surrounding the disposition of the flight, ranging from a military downing, aircraft hijacking, terrorist attack, to a pilot suicide over his deteriorating personal life, but all of these suggestions have not been proven substantially.

How can I decide what bike I should get?,"First, decide what kind of cyclist you are.  If you will primarily ride for transportation, for exercise, or for sport, you will need a bike that fits your needs for each of those categories.  If you want to ride year-round, consider how you'll store your bike.  If you'll likely be riding in the city, you may want to consider a hybrid bike with a chain-drive motor for short trips.  If you'll likely be riding in the country, look for a road or hybrid bike with a rear-drive motor for long trips.  If you have young children, look for a mountain bike with a suspension fork for riding in rough terrain.  If you want a mountain bike, don't buy a cruiser bike because you'll mostly ride on paved roads and you want a bike that will allow you to get a good workout.  You may also want a hybrid bike for touring on roads and trails rather than a regular road bike.  If you want a road bike, consider a road bike that's a little more comfortable (e.g. a mountain bike with a more upright geometry) or a hybrid bike that has a more comfortable-feeling frame.  If you want a bike for commuting, consider the size of the city and the amount of time you will spend cycling in it.  If you'll also be riding outside of the city, consider how much rain you'll likely experience.  If you live in a humid climate, consider a mountain bike rather than a road bike.  If you live in a dry climate, consider a hybrid bike.  If you ride with others, think about who you will ride with and whether they can handle a longer bike.  If you'll be riding on a wide variety of surfaces, consider a bike with a fannypack or other suspension system.  If you ride on hills, consider a bike with a dropsawn fork.  If you ride in the mountains, consider a bike with asuspension fork for snow.  If you ride regularly in all kinds of weather, consider a hybrid bike.  If you like to ride in the spring, consider a bike with a spring fork.  If you like to ride in the fall, consider a bike with a autumn fork.  If you like to ride in the winter, consider a bike with a winter fork.","When it comes to bicycles for adults, there are different kinds available in the market. Select a bike based on how you'd like to use it. Bikes can be categorized as follows:
1. Road bikes - These bikes have super thin tires and are often used for biking on roads. These help you attain high speeds relatively quickly.
2. Mountain bikes - These bikes are made to sustain the rough terrain that you could come across while biking. The tires are much thicker made to protect you and give you the support you need.
3. Hybrid/Commuter bikes - These bikes fall into the middle of the above 2 categories. If you think you might do a bit of road biking and mountain biking, then this might be your best option.

How do I do a headstand?,"To do a headstand you need to have good core strength, and flexible hips and knees. Sit tall on the floor with your legs shoulder width and your arms by your ears. Bring your chin into your chest and take a big inhale, as you lift your hips off the floor. Exhale as you lower yourself to the floor. Keep repeating this movement for at least 3-5 breaths. When you’re ready to stand, you’ll be able to do this faster if you support yourself on your hands and knees. From here, you can slowly step out of the pose or you can try doing a handstand.","Start in a tabletop position with your knees on the ground and your hands placed underneath your shoulders.  Draw your chin into your chest and lower the crown of your head onto the ground.  Curl your toes under and lift your knees up off the ground.  Place each knee on your tricep.  Push into the heal of your palm to lift your knees off your tricep.  With your low core deeply engaged, continue to lift your knees higher until your legs are fully extended.

Why can't the whole world be 2 countries?,"This is a difficult concept to understand, but there are a few reasons. For one, the United Nations will not allow it. If two countries get too close to one another, the UN will send military forces to make sure that no one country tries to take over the other. This is necessary because in order for two countries to be considered two separate countries, they need to have a distinct culture, language, and history. So, in order to become two separate countries, two nations would have to become very close to each other. Another reason that two countries can not become one is that if the whole world were one country, then all of the natural resources in the whole world would be needed to survive. This would lead to an overpopulation of people and an over-consumption of resources, which would lead to an overpopulation of animals, plants, and other living things. So the whole world would need to feed, house, and clothe all of these animals, plants, and other living things. This would lead to an overpopulation of all of these living things and a reduction in the resources that the living things need to survive. This would lead to an overpopulation of all of the animals, plants, and other living things and another overpopulation. This process would go on and on until there were no living things left.",The whole world cannot be split into two countries because it would be impossible to maintain the balance of power between the two countries.,0.538232,0.99753,8.660833,0.796874,0.567482,2.31219,-2.8975017070770264

Please describe what Business Process Mapping is and why it is used,Business process mapping is a process to map out business processes.  Business processes can be complex and are often times not documented.  Business process mapping can be used to help inform the design of a product or a system.  Using the business process map will help inform the system design by providing a roadmap of the business processes.  The system design can then be informed by what the business process looks like.  The business process also helps the business to better understand what is expected of the system or product.,"Business Process Mapping describes the capture of a set of business activities that deliver an outcome.  Mapping is usually performed using visual tools that use standardized shapes to indicate entities.  Mapping involves capturing activities, the roles performing the activities, systems and tools used to execute the activities and inputs and outputs from the activities.  Process mapping is frequently conducted in cross functional workshops with a facilitator capturing the activities performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  Common uses of process mapping include:

how would you start explaining mathematics to kids?,"I would start by explaining mathematics as the language of science.  It is a way to explain the world around us and how we can use that information to understand the world and make decisions.  Math is also a way for us to understand the universe and what is possible.  Science is the study of the universe and what is possible.  Scientists use math to help us understand the world.  By teaching kids the language of science, I want them to be able to make connections between what they learn in class and in real life.  

I would start by explaining math in terms of numbers.  Kids are born with some basic math skills but they can learn new skills as they grow.  Kids are able to understand and make sense of numbers and the relationships between numbers.  Numbers are used in everyday life.  They are used to pay bills, to rent an apartment, and to buy groceries.  Kids use numbers to understand what they owe and what they have.  When kids are young, they are learning about two numbers, zero and one.  Zero is the number that does not have a quantity.  For example, zero is the number that is not a number.  Zero is the number of cake slices a person can have.  One is the number of cake slices that a person can have.  One is the number of cake slices you can have.  Zero is the number that is always added to a quantity to get a new number.  One is the number that is always subtracted from a quantity to get a new number.  Zero is the number that is always divided by a quantity to get a new number.  Kids are also learning about zero and one as they grow.  Kids understand that the number one is always followed by zero.  For example, five is followed by ten.  

Kids are also learning about addition and subtraction.  Kids are able to understand the relationships between numbers just by seeing.  For example, one plus two equals three.  Kids can see that one plus two is not three plus two.  There is an addition that is not an addition.  Kids can also see that one is less than two.  One is less than two because one is one less than two.  A less than sign is used to compare two numbers.  Kids can see that one is less than two.  Kids can also see that two is less than three.  Kids can also know that","There are many ways to start thinking and talking about mathematics with your kids. Here are three simple but effective ideas:

Give me a summary about Michael Jackson,"Michael Joseph Jackson (June 25, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and human rights activist. He is considered by many to be one of the most influential figures in music history. Jackson was also an outspoken advocate for the protection of children in the entertainment industry.

Jackson was born at Covington County Hospital in Bel Air, Maryland. His father, Joe Jackson, was a successful ventriloquist and children's act performer, while his mother, Katherine, was a schoolteacher. He had four siblings: three older half-sisters, Katherine, LaToya, and LaPorsha, and a younger brother, Randy. Jackson grew up in Bel-Air and in Gary, Indiana, before moving to Los Angeles with his family in 1977 at the age of 17. Jackson's early musical interest was in the rhythm and blues genre, and he formed his first group, the Jackson Five, with his brothers Tito, Jermaine, Randy, Jackie, and Marlon at the age of seven. They became known for their recording of ""I Want You Back"".

After the Jackson Five's first album was released in January 1968, Jackson signed with Motown Records, and his career began to take off. He became known for his distinctive musical style and extensive choreography, and his songs incorporated elements of funk, jazz, rock, and R&B. The Jackson 5's first two albums, Matilda andJackson 5, both went to number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Jackson had five number-one albums on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was awarded four gold and two platinum discs in the United States. He had five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and was awarded three platinum and four gold discs in the United States. In 1984, Jackson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Jacksons.

Jackson was also a talented dancer and was well known for his signature dance moves, including the ""funky chicken"". In the early 1980s, Jackson became a spokesman for the United Negro College Fund. In 1986, Jackson became involved with the People to People organization and began working with children around the world. He advocated for the eradication of child labour in Africa and the protection of children in the entertainment industry. Jackson was also an outspoken advocate for the protection of children in the entertainment industry, and in the early 1990s, he and his siblings filed a","Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist.

Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.

The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall.

Who are the most influential female computer scientists of all time?,"These days, it is hard to think of a computer scientist who is not female.  However, in the 1950s and 1960s, there were very few women in this field and the most influential ones were Grace Hopper, Alta M. Green, and Ada Lovelace.  Grace Hopper was perhaps the best known computer scientist of the time and is often referred to as the ""mother of the modern computer"" in recognition of her role in the invention of the computer.  She is also credited with coining the term ""computer science"" during the early 1950s.  Hopper's work at the United States Navy'sCode & Language School is where she first used a computer to solve a problem and broke the barrier for women to be involved in computer science.  Her legendary ability to solve complex problems with a computer quickly made her the go-to person for the Navy on computing matters.  Alta M. Green had a similar career trajectory and is also considered one of the first computer scientists.  The reason for this is that she not only used her background as a mathematician to understand the logic of the digital computer but also was able to teach herself programming when she needed to.  This made her an invaluable member of the MIT AI Lab and one of the most influential computer scientists of the time.  Her work with the AI Lab was extended when she wrote the first computer program to solve the famous traveling salesman problem in 1957.  This allowed computers to be used on more complex problems and provided an entry point for women to enter computer science.  Alta M. Green also did early work on the design of a compiler and also invented the first symbolic computer program known as the ""Semantic Analyzer"" which was used to help develop the first compiler.  This led to her being recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as ""one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century"".  She was also a pioneer for better representation of computer code on paper and created the first computer language that utilized markup symbols to write computer code.  These achievements were followed by Ada Lovelace, who is often referred to as the ""mother of computer science"".  Lovelace was one of the few women at the time who had a background in mathematics and knew how to program.  Her work was widely used in the development of the first computer algorithms and programs and is considered as the ""mother of AI"".  She is also credited with the first ever computer algorithm that utilized mathematics to model the behavior of objects","Ada Lovelace

- The risk measurements used in MPT are probabilistic because MPT models risk in terms of the likelihood of losses based on past market data and not why the losses occur.
- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn’t reflect investors’ true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors’ preference

Why some people are more stressed than others and how to manage stress?,Stress is the normal human reaction to any kind of threat or danger.  It is a response to the body's fight or flight system.  Stress is an emotions based response.  If your are stressed out of your control the best thing you can do is stop the source of stress.  This generally involves addressing the problem or situation that is causing the stress.  If you can't solve the problem you can reduce your stress by identifying it and addressing it.  Finally you can learn how to manage stress by learning how to control your emotions.,"Stress handling is a trait which comes naturally for some people, meaning they have it in their genetics. Some are born with this quality to manage hard and tricky situations with a cool behaviour, but for others it is tricky and they really need to train themselves to certain situations.When a person is stressed, it is always best they share their feelings with someone they trust.In a stressful situation, the natural response of our body is the release of Cortisol, which is the primary hormone which gets released and a good physical exercise routine can help in managing it.Prolonged stress leads to complicated issues such as Anxiety and  Depression which could be managed by practicing some relaxation techniques such as Yoga and Deep breathing.",0.880983,0.996998,6.884198,0.976194,0.883926,2.12446,-4.259515762329102

How can introverts maintain friendship.,"Introverts are hard to befriend because their inner life is often more interesting and engaging than the social world in which they exist. This is not to say that introverts do not enjoy social interactions. Rather, the social world is not significant enough to engage their full attention. Therefore, introverts need to actively seek out ways to maintain and deepen their friendships. Here are some ideas:

1. Make time for the introvert in your life. Often the most difficult thing for introverts to do is share in their own company. To befriend an introvert, you have to show the introvert that it is not a burden. Introverts need to know that your friends are also introverts. You can do this by making friends with introverts and by sharing your own introversion with the introvert in your life.

2. Share your own inner world. Introverts often have a lot of inner life that is not reflected in the social world. This may be a source of anxiety for the introvert. However, sharing your own inner life can be a source of great joy for you and for your introvert friend. You can do this by having conversations about your experiences, thoughts, feelings, and emotions. You can also discuss your inner life in the form of art, writing, or other creative expression.

3. Find common interests. Introverts often have their own unique interests and passions. However, introverts may not find the other introvert to share their interests. In this case, you can find common interests that you and the introvert in your life share. For example, you can find common interests by meeting for coffee or by joining the introvert for a hike.

4. Be honest and open. Introverts often have their own unique way of thinking and communicating. However, introverts often have the capacity to be more honest and open than extroverts. This means that introverts can be more honest about their own inner life and about their own struggles. For introverts, this can be quite freeing. It means that they don't have to worry about how they are perceived by the extrovert in their life.

5. Keep an eye out for opportunities to deepen the friendship. Introverts often have more to teach the extrovert than the extrovert has to teach the introvert. This is because introverts often have a rich inner life that is not shared by the social world. For introverts, this means","Introverts like to be themselves. They dont like being forced to things why dont like to do. This is extremely difficult for them. They respect their friends space and expect the same in return. Introverts need to find friends who respect them for what they are and dont push them to do things they dont like and have said no to once. Generally extroverts tend to bring people to follow them, hence extroverts are not great friends for introverts, but its generally not true completely. Introverts may need to be little extrovert to express their line which their friends should push them over.",0.265842,0.999251,30.123043,0.846168,0.360468,6.518954,-3.837036371231079

Hawaii has a diverse range of visitor destinations, with more than 30,000 jobs, nearly $19 billion in expenditures, and over $30 billion in economic impacts.  Tourism has also had a significant impact on the natural environment, with the number of planted pineapple plants declining by 80% between 1989 and 2007 as a result of tourism.

- On environmental perspective, the state of Hawaii established certification program to educate local communities to practice sustainable and conservation-minded tour operators
- On the resource perspective, water, landscape and energy usage increased significantly and led to concerns on reduced natural habitats for birds and animals
- On the refuse management perspective, trashes, especially plastics, became a major concern both environmentally and economically.

What are the ways to save money in gardening?,"Saving money in gardening is a matter of choosing the right practices and tools.  Start by choosing the right type of soil.  Soil that is well-drained and somewhat fertile will allow plants to grow more vigorously and quickly than soil that is poorly drained or mostly clay soil.  Next, choose the right type of seeds.  The most common type of seeds is ""annuals""  These are plants that come back every year.  Some plants that are good for gardeners to keep around for the long run include marigolds, nasturtiums, zinnias, onions, and snapdragons.  Annuals are easier to keep around than perennial plants, but they don't produce seeds, so they must be replanted after each growing season.  Other plants that are good for gardens but don't bring seeds are rhubarb, strawberries, and raspberries.  Plants that produce seeds include peas, beans, corn, squash, squashes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and melons.  Some plants that are good for gardens but not for seed production are begonias, zinnias, petunias, phlox, cosmos, and snapdragons.  Last, decide on the size of your garden and follow the directions on the plant or the directions on the seed packet.  It is best to plant your seeds in the spring or summer, when the soil is warm and not frozen.  After planting, water the seeds thoroughly.  They will grow only if they receive adequate water.  Once your garden is established start with annual plants and add perennial plants as they mature.  If you want to save money on plants and seeds, buy plants at a discount nursery or from online sources.  The plants will last for several years and will give you many opportunities to save money.","1. Avoid buying potting mix by making your own potting soil

Can I make chocolate at home?,"Chocolate is a dark sweetened beverage made from the beans of the cocoa plant. It can be made at home from cocoa beans, which are roasted and crushed, or from cacao paste, which is made by adding sugar to unroasted cocoa beans. The color of chocolate will depend on the type of cocoa used, as well as the amount of sugar and other ingredients. White chocolate is made by using sugar to temper dark chocolate. White chocolate is also known as milk chocolate, as it is often used in chocolate milk. There are many types of chocolate available, including milk, dark, white and best bitter chocolate.","Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans. For equipment, you will need a melanger (about $600)  to grind the beans and a tempering machine (about $400) to make the finished product. You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.

Buy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.

Sort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.

Roast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!

Let the beans cool.

Peel the beans. You can do this by hand - which I find produces a superior product - but be",0.876802,0.997277,5.954203,0.944186,0.883861,1.931266,-3.4693896770477295

Why is cold water coming out of my water heater?,"Your water heater is likely leaking. Cold water is coming out of your water heater because cold water is coming out of your water heater. There are a couple things that may be causing the leak. First, the water heater could be leaking at the main water line, which is typically located outside of your home near the curb. In this case, you will likely see cold water outside of your home near the curb.

If the leak is coming from the water heater, then it's possible that the water tank is damaged and is leaking water. This is typically caused by overloading the valve or a damaged or cracked tank. If the leak is coming from the water tank, you can replace the tank or the gasket around the tank valve. If the leak is coming from the valve, you can replace the valve.","If your gas water heater is not working, first check to see if:

 - Is the water heater leaking? If so, turn off the water and gas to the heater, and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 - Do you smell gas around your heater? If so, you likely have a gas leak--turn off the gas line to the heater and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 
If neither of these are issues, check to see if the pilot light for you heater is lit. This is likely hidden behind a panel or door on the bottom of the front of the heater.  If the pilot light is not lit, follow the instructions to try re-lighting it.

If the pilot light does not light or continues to go out after heating the water, the thermal coupling on the water heater likely needs to be replaced. Contact a plumber to have this replaced.

Generally speaking, traditional tank-based, gas water heaters have a lifetime of 10-15 years. If the age water heater is within this range, you may want to prepare for replacing the water heater soon.",0.010409,0.976201,8.116495,0.961598,0.012963,2.015533,-3.519420862197876

write a short essay on murals in jersey city,"Mural art is an art form that has been around for over 100 years, and has recently been gaining popularity in New York City. The Jersey City Mural Project is an organization in Jersey City, New Jersey that has been painting murals on large surfaces with the aim of educating and inspiring community members of their surrounding area. The organization is run by a collective of artists and volunteers, and has been working together since 2004. The muralists are motivated to paint large-scale murals because they want to engage the community and promote local artists and artisans. The murals are often painted on the backs of disused warehouses or abandoned buildings, but sometimes the murals are painted on buildings that are not in use, such as a church or a school. The murals are painted using a variety of different mediums, such as spray paint, oil paint, water paint, and marker paint, but the most common medium is oil paint, which is used to paint large-scale murals with intricate detail and vibrant colors.

Artists can apply to paint a mural, but they can also volunteer to help with other tasks, such as painting the mural's outline and filling in the white space around the edges of the buildings. The muralists are given a specific area to paint and a set amount of time in which to complete the painting, but the group is open to new applicants and encourages new people to join the organization. The volunteers paint the mural during the day, but sometimes the muralists are also busy with other activities, such as working on a commissioned piece or teaching classes. 

The process of applying for a mural, painting the mural, and then cleaning the space is similar to how a painter would approach a commission, but with a unique twist: the artists and volunteers are not paid, although they sometimes receive free food as a reward for their hard work. The organization also has an annual art fair that takes place in the summer, which is attended by thousands of people, and is a great way for people outside of Jersey City to see the work of the organization.","Jersey City is known for its vibrant street art scene, with murals adorning walls throughout the city.

What is the history of coffee?,"Coffee originated in Ethiopia around 6,000 years ago.","Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?","Issue consistency is the consistency of a person’s beliefs or opinions on a specific issue. Public opinion is a social phenomenon that can be analyzed at different levels. At the most basic level, we can observe people’s opinions on a specific issue. In other words, we can observe the “level of conceptualization” of a person. The concept of issue consistency refers to how a certain issue or a particular belief is consistent or inconsistent for a person. For example, a person who believes in global warming is likely to be a “global warming supporter” or “pro-environmentalist”. In contrast, someone who is a “pro-business” or a “anti-environmentalist” is unlikely to believe in global warming.

Issue consistency is another level of analysis that refers to how a person’s opinions and beliefs on an issue are consistent or inconsistent. For example, issue consistency refers to whether someone believes in global warming or not, whether they are “pro-environmentalist” or “anti-environmentalist”. The concept of issue consistency is more complicated than that. It is also important to consider the “levels of conceptualization” of a person.

First, we can observe people’s preferences or attitudes on a certain issue. For example, it is common to see people’s “approval” on a specific party or a certain issue. “Approval” refers to how people feel about a particular issue. It is also possible to observe people’s “preference” on an issue. People who prefer a certain party or issue are called “supporters” or “supporters of the party or issue”.

In addition to “preference” and “approval”, it is also possible to observe people’s “conceptualization” of an issue. The “level of conceptualization” refers to how a person views an issue. For example, it is common to see people’s “pro-environmental” or “anti-global warming” “conceptualizations”.

In summary, the concept of issue consistency refers to how a person’s opinions and beliefs are consistent or inconsistent. The concept of issue consistency is more complicated than that. It is also important to consider the “levels of conceptualization” of a person.","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.  Fourth are “nature of the times”, when evaluations of candidates and parties are tied to general perceptions about",0.828772,0.999043,21.578672,0.992184,0.879302,5.055594,-3.084211826324463

Why should people convert lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants?,"By planting native plants in lawns and ornamental gardens, the plants are not competing with desired plant species in a landscape.  In many cases, native plants in landscapes have evolved over thousands of years with the species in the landscape.  Therefore, the plants are adapted and thus more resistant to pests and diseases and thrive better in certain climate zones than non-native plants.  In some cases, native plants in a landscape are a better choice for a site than non-native plants.  There are also more native species that are smaller and more drought resistant than larger non-native species.  For these reasons and many others, it is best to plant native plants in landscapes.  Converting lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants is an easy and inexpensive way to increase biodiversity and improve the health of a landscape.","Who doesn’t love butterflies?

"What are your views on the ""First Principles"" by ""Thomas E. Ricks""","""First Principles"" is a non-fiction book written by US Army officer, former CIA officer, and national security advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney, Thomas E. Ricks. The book is about the decisions made in the years leading up to the Iraq War and the dilemmas faced by the Bush Administration. It was published by Penguin Press on November 11, 2007.

""First Principles"" is a critical analysis of the Bush Administration's decision-making process during the Iraq War. Ricks' main focus is on the period from 2004 to 2006, which is called the ""Iraqi Surge"". He covers the decisions made by top administration officials such as Condoleezza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Bremer, and John Negroponte. He also describes the challenges faced by the Bush Administration, such as the insurgency and al-Qaeda in Iraq, the lack of democracy, and the sectarian violence.

Ricks argues that Bush Administration officials were trapped in an ""illusion of control"". They believed that they could control the Iraq conflict through military means, negotiations, and reconstruction. However, they were unable to control the situation because of the insurgency and the lack of political will to reform Iraq. He also criticizes the Bush Administration for not having a clear exit strategy from Iraq.","1.

What is the difference between AWD and 4WD?,"AWD stands for ""All Wheel Drive"" and refers to the ability of a vehicle to operate only on all 4 wheel-driven wheels. A vehicle with AWD is able to operate without an auxiliary ""4WD"" mode. It's the same as having 4WD in a car, but in a truck, it means the engine can be switched to ""D"" mode to help get the truck moving if the driver leaves the clutch in gear when the truck is parked.","AWD is a system that without driver intervention, shifts power between the rear and front wheels. This system is typically found on light-duty SUVs or passenger cars. The AWD drive system is designed for mild inclement weather conditions such as light snow, ice and rain. It is not designed for off-roading or severe weather conditions such as heavy snow or mud. This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. 

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel.

Why are some people vegetarian?,"Most people who are vegetarians choose to reduce or eliminate consumption of animal products such as meat, poultry, fish, and dairy.  The animal agriculture industry is the second largest industry in the United States.  It is estimated that more than 90 percent of all animals raised for food end up in a grocery store.  If all animals raised for food were to become vegetarians, the demand for animal products would need to increase by 300 percent!  If the demand for animal products increases by 300 percent, you can be sure that animal agriculture will find a way to increase production.  The best way to reduce your consumption of animal products is to go plant based.  A plant based diet is rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.  It is also much lower in saturated fat and cholesterol than a typical North American diet.  A plant based diet has been shown to help prevent and treat a number of chronic diseases and conditions including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.  Not only does a plant based diet help you stay healthy, it also reduces the negative environmental impact of animal agriculture.  The livestock industry is the second largest source of climate changing greenhouse gas emissions.  A plant based diet can also help reduce the climate change impact of animal agriculture.  The average person who goes plant based and cuts their animal product consumption by 50 percent will save money, reduce the climate change impact of animal agriculture, and help prevent and treat a number of chronic diseases and conditions.","There are many reasons for being vegetarian. Some religions prohibit eating meat. Other people prefer not eat meat because they consider it immoral. The environmental impact of the meat industry has convinced other groups of people to stop eating meat to reduce their carbon footprint.

    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.

Who is the greatest musical theatre composer of all time?,The greatest musical theatre composer of all time is Stephen Sondheim,"While art is subjective, there are a few luminary composers who have made significant contributions to musical theatre and whose work has stood the test of time. One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot.

What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,"Batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, or some other measure of batting performance are typically calculated by counting a batter's number of bases plus any bases that are scored but not accounted for in the batting metric.  That is, if the batter only goes 0-1 on a base when the batter ""walks"" into the base, then the batter only goes to first base and the batting metric can account for the batter going no further than first base.  Batting average, for example, is calculated by dividing the number of bases by the number of times a batter goes at least one base into the bag.","There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. 

There are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.",0.882946,0.995039,2.82917,0.772759,0.907882,1.277559,-4.044946193695068

There is no one leader or master in hinduism like in christianity or islam and it is totally inclusive. Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings. So start your day with a prayer to elephant god.

Why Rafael Nadal succeeds on clay?,"Rafael Nadal has more than twenty five years of clay court experience, he knows very well how to play on clay and what is the key to win against top players. He has got his style and now he can win on clay even against the best players in the world.","Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.",0.957841,0.997182,1.994816,0.217668,0.951961,1.023894,-2.962498664855957

History of the Arches National Park creation.,"Congress created Arches National Park on December 3, 1949, with the passage of the Arches National Park Act.","First Humans appeared in this region during the last ice age 10000 years ago. The first settlers began in 1775 but were abandoned before 1855 when ranchers, farmers, and prospectors settled in Moab(the closest city to the Arches). The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created.

how to fight a speeding ticket?,"There are several possible avenues to pursue when facing a speeding ticket.  First and foremost, you should consult with an experienced attorney.  Your lawyer should examine the circumstances surrounding your ticket, assess your chances of winning the case and help you to choose the most effective course of action.  

Another approach is to engage an aggressive defense attorney.  An aggressive defense attorney is one that will fight on your behalf and will likely try to negotiate a settlement with the prosecutor to reduce or dismiss the charges against you.  An aggressive defense attorney will likely spend more time going over discovery documents with you, gaining a better understanding of the case and the evidence against you.  He or she will also be better able to communicate with you and help you to understand the likely outcomes of your case.  

A third approach is to simply pay the ticket, either up front or in installments.  While this may not seem like the most attractive strategy, it is not uncommon for a defendant to pay a speeding ticket in full or in part.  There are two main reasons that a defendant may be inclined to pay a speeding ticket.  First, a defendant's insurance may cover the speeding ticket.  Second, a defendant may simply not want to incur the time and expense of a trial if they believe they will lose.  

On the other hand, paying a speeding ticket may not be the best strategy either.  If you are caught speeding by the police and your insurance carrier doesn't pay the ticket, your insurance carrier may take action against you (e.g., deny you coverage, restrict access to your car) and place a lien on your car.  

If you are not insured, paying the ticket will likely result in a larger judgment being entered against you in the event that you are convicted.  The judgment will likely fall on your car title and your car will be impounded.  As a result you may have to spend more money in order to redeem your car.  

A final approach is to settle the case without going to trial.  In such a case, the prosecutor will likely offer to dismiss the speeding ticket in exchange for a payment from the defendant.  If you are willing to make a payment towards the ticket, you may be able to avoid going to trial entirely or at least significantly reduce the charge against you.  

An experienced attorney can help you select the most appropriate course of action.","Three common ways to resolve a speeding tickets are 1. taking a defensive driving course: it takes about 20 hours to complete the course content but you can speed it up by playing the videos at 2x speed with a chrome plug-in. Some people just let the video play like background noise and do whatever is on the side.  2. hire an attorney to take care of it, the cost depends on your ticket details and varies based on attorneys. But it is the most care-free way as the attorney deals with the court on your behalf. There is no guarantee it always succeeds though. 3. go to the court yourself and fight it. This takes a lot of gut because you will need to face the judge and prosecuting attorney or the traffic policy on the court the defend yourself.",0.384972,0.999286,20.290892,0.980096,0.492829,4.629615,-4.294737339019775

what is the difference between ARM and x86 chipsets?,ARM and x86 are both of the instruction set architecture (ISA) family of processors. The main difference is that x86 ISA family is primarily used in personal computers whereas ARM ISA is used in a wide range of products ranging from mobile phones to supercomputers. The primary difference is that x86 instructions are based on 32-bit logical addresses whereas ARM instructions are based on 16-bit physical addresses.,ARM uses Reduced Instruction Set Computing Architecture (RISC) whereas x86 uses Complex Instruction Set Computing Architecture (CISC). ARM executes single instruction per cycle whereas x86 executes complex instructions in multiple cycles. This allows softwares to be optimized for performance against ARM chipset as opposed to an 86 hardware approach to optimize. It would also be interesting to mention that ARM uses higher memory and less registers compared to x86.,0.769612,0.99841,2.993144,0.771728,0.799995,1.266578,-3.193061351776123

What is salvation in christianity?,"Salvation in Christianity is a process by which a sinner is considered to be justified or accepted by God.  This is based on the fact that the person accepted Jesus as their Savior.  Salvation is considered to be a free gift from God and is not earned or earned by a sinner.  The person who believes in Jesus is accepted by God as his/her personal savior.  Jesus paid the penalty due for our sins on the cross.  After Jesus died, he was just hanging on the cross with no chance of getting down.  Then he said, ""It is finished.""  The Bible says that at that moment, Jesus was ""crowned with glory and honour and power that never shall fade"" (Revelation 3:21).  Jesus then rose from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of God.  He is also the firstborn over all who are born of God.  Those who believe in Jesus are adopted into the family of God and are accepted as children of God.  They are born again and no longer beholden to sin and live for God.  This is the redemption or the forgiveness of our sins.","Salvation in christianity is the redemption of human beings from the consequences of their sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

my name is __ and I'm a tenant here at __. Our lease is up in __ and I've been wanting to get a dog for a while.
I've been thinking about getting a golden retriever, but I'm having trouble finding one that meets all our needs.

To help me find a good dog, I wanted to talk to someone who has owned a golden retriever before. I was curious if you've ever owned a golden retriever, and if so, what type of qualities do you look for in a dog when choosing one?

For example, I've heard that golden retrievers are known to be friendly and gentle dogs. Do you agree? If so, do you look for a particular personality when choosing one? If so, what type of personality do you look for?

I'm also looking for a dog that will play with my kids. I've heard that golden retrievers are good with children. Do you agree?

I was also wondering if you could recommend any good trainers that I could speak to. I've seen a lot of bad reviews about dog training from other dog owners, and I'm worried that I might get a bad experience if I go with a trainer that doesn't know what they're doing.

I also want to find a dog that is small enough to be kept as a pet and still has the size to play with the kids. Do you have any recommendations on this?

Thank you for your help in helping me find the right dog. I really appreciate it!

Best,

How are odds different from probability?,"Odds are different from probabilities because the former is a count while the latter is a fraction.  What does this mean?  When dealing with numbers that are fractions, you need to be careful.  If you have a number, such as 12/20 and you want to know the remainder, you need to convert it to a fraction.  First, divide 12 by 20.  This will give you the numerator (12/20) and the denominator (20).  Then, you can convert the fraction to a number.  The remainder is 12/20 which is 6.","Both are measurements for how likely it is for an event to occur. Odds are commonly used in gambling, which probability is a measure that is commonly used in mathematics/statistics. In statistics, probability measures the number of outcomes in which a particular event occurred divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days. The odds are measured as the number of events divided by the number of non-events. To contrast, probability would be the number of events divided by the sum of events and non-events.",0.902089,0.99771,2.904043,0.882118,0.909762,1.319144,-4.449115753173828

The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul.

What are the applications of game theory in NBA basketball?,"In basketball, there are several strategies that the players can pursue to maximize their individual pay.  In particular, the strategies for the players on either side of the ball are very different.  The offense must find the best combination of shots to score while trying to minimize turnovers.  The defense must minimize the number of shots they let in while also minimizing the number of turnovers.  Therefore, it is of interest to understand how strategies can be designed that maximize the team's total score while minimizing the individual pay of the players.  The Nash Equilibrium is the best strategy for this situation.","Game theory studies the strategic interaction of rationale agents. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy.

However, as a result of World War I, Europe rapidly developed its industrial sector, whose subsequent growth led to an increased demand for Africa's exports.

Do you agree with this, or do you think streaming video is a ""disruptive"" technology for Netflix that does not align with its core business and requires a different strategy?",I agree with this characterization.,"Netflix did a strategic renewal by cannibalizing its own cash cow business of mail-in-DVD services. This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform. Netflix made Blockbuster dance to its tunes. Netflix, currently valued at $150 billion, changed its business model twice by cannibalizing its core services, shifting from mail-in- DVD service to subscription service to streaming video subscription service.

Using examples taken from the text give me a rundown of the primary environments found in Yellowstone National Park.,"Yellowstone National Park has three different environments: geothermal, world-class scenic, and wild and scenic. The geothermal environment is found in the Yellowstone Caldera, which sits at the base of the park. The Yellowstone Caldera is the result of a massive volcanic explosion that occurred over 150 million years ago. The area is filled with hot water in the ground, and when the ground cools, the hot water is released as steam. The steam rises to the surface and creates a large caldera. You can see the steam rising from the ground at Yellowstone National Park. The world-class scenic environment is found near the geothermal area in the St. Joe Valley. St. Joe Valley is a scenic area with beautiful lakes and mountains. This area is also home to hundreds of wildlife species and over 400 species of plant life. The wild and scenic environment is found in the Snake Valley Unit, which is found on the eastern side of the park. Snake Valley Unit is a remote area that is home to thousands of wildlife species, but is also a popular destination for visitors.","Generally considered to be the first national park in the world, Yellowstone National Park is significant in size, covering parts of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and acts as the largest remaining nearly-intact ecosystems.  The park is able to support many types of wildlife including Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, mountain goats, free-ranging herds of bison and elk, as well as many types of birds and fish, because of the diversity of habitats.  Forests and grasslands dominate some areas of the park, while others offer the completely different experience of mountain ranges, lakes, and rolling prairies.

What is the best way to file California State Tax for Spouse Abroad in community property jurisdiction countries like China? The goal is to minimize the tax for community property income.,"I would research the relevant community property laws and the income/spousal status of the taxpayer. For example, in China, exempt income includes all income from source of income such as wages, income from business or self-employment. The income of one spouse is exempt from the tax of the other spouse. The income of community property is not exempt from the tax of the sole owner. Therefore, the tax of community property income varies by the income of the taxpayer. Based on the income, the tax of community property income may be exempt. You can also consult a tax professional for guidance.","For resident spouse in California (CA) and non-resident spouse living and working in China, you can file Federal tax jointly and California state tax separately to minimize the community property income. But since both the California state and China are community property jurisdiction, only 50% of the non-resident spouse's income can be exempt from CA state tax, i.e. 100% of the resident spouse's California source income needs to be filed (50% in resident's form 540, and another 50% in non-resident's form 540NR), and 50% of non-resident spouse's foreign income needs to be filed in resident's Form 540.

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye,"Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction that takes place in a subatomic particle called the neutron. A neutron from one atom can split into two smaller particles: a proton and an electron, with a little more energy than the original neutron. The nucleus of each of these new atoms contains one more free neutron than the original atom, and the process can continue this way, releasing energy in the form of heat and light.

The splitting of a neutron, or nuclear fission, is a key step in the nuclear reaction chain that powers the Sun, as well as in many industrial processes and in the creation of nuclear weapons.","Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.920943,0.997212,3.982581,0.960962,0.923063,1.556952,-3.771198272705078

"Can you write a brief summary for the book ""Braving the Wilderness"" by Brene Brown?","Brene Brown is a best-selling author and one of the foremost experts on courage. She developed the concept of “bravery quotient” and has conducted research on courage in a variety of contexts. Bravery is a key leadership quality because it requires the courage to make difficult decisions and to take action. Brown argues that our definition of courage is too narrow and that we underestimate the importance of bravery in our lives. She argues that bravery is an innate quality that can be developed through practice. Brown describes the three components of courage: facing fear, taking action, and feeling the fear. She suggests that we practice courage by facing fear, taking action, and not reacting to fear. Brown gives many examples from her life of people she considers courageous.","Braving the Wilderness is a book about belonging, identity, and leadership. A core idea is that if you are courageous enough to stand alone in the name of the virtues and values you believe in, you can actually create more belonging for others. To brave the wilderness is not to go into the woods armored and ready to fight, but with an open heart and conviction steadying your spine.",0.656969,0.998305,7.968078,0.803637,0.762684,2.237935,-3.9049460887908936
