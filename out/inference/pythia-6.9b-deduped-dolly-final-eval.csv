You can subtract two numbers by starting with an initial count, which represents the number to subtract from, and a second count which represents the number to subtract.  Then remove one from the starting count repeating this operation for the number of items in the subtract value.  

Subtraction is not associative, which means that the order in which subtraction is performed matters.  For instance, seven minus five (7 - 3) equals four (= 4) but four minus seven (4 - 7) equals minus three (= -3).",0.871225,0.99384,2.978046,0.045422,0.862151,1.150137,-4.5235595703125

What is a spatial network?,"A spatial network is a network representation of locations or locations and associated weights. It is a network where the nodes are locations (e.g., points on a map) and the links are associated weights. Spatial networks are used in network analysis, spatial probability, and spatial statistics.","A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.",0.463779,0.995908,2.9889,0.249914,0.451681,1.030037,-4.002330780029297

Tell me a few highlights about Madonna's impact on pop music.,"Madonna's impact on pop music is vast. She is one of the most well-known singers in history and has had an influence on both pop music and society as a whole. The number of artists who have cited her as an influence is staggering. 

She has been cited as a major influence on the development of hip hop and rap, with artists like Notorious BIG, Eminem, Jay-Z, Tupac Shakur, and Nas all referencing her in songs and interviews. She has also had a major impact on Lady Gaga. Many credit Madonna's performance of the Vogue (meets Rapunzel in the middle) at the 1992 MTV video music Awards as the moment Gaga decided to pursue a career in music. She has also been credited with inspiring a new wave of female pop singers, including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Gwen Stefani. She has had a major impact on fashion, as many of her clothing styles were copied by other pop singers and influenced fashion trends for decades. She has also been credited with helping AIDS charity work by encouraging people to get tested for the disease and by supporting the LGBTQ+ community. 

Beyond all of this, she has been one of the most successful musicians in history. In addition to selling hundreds of millions of records, she has had twenty-two top-10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She has won eighteen Grammy Awards, and her album Madonna (1990) and True Blue (1992) are considered by many to be the best-selling albums of all time.

How do I make good pour over coffee?,"Pour over coffee is the process of placing a loose ground coffee into a filter and then pouring hot water through it, extracting the coffee's compounds. The best coffee beans are French pressed, but for those that prefer a pour over, here are some tips and tricks:

-Use fresh ground coffee
-Use fresh water - tap water is best, but distilled water is acceptable
-Use heat - too little and you won't extract the coffee's flavor, too much and it won't extract
-Use a pour over filter - paper coffee filters are preferred to metal because the metal can sometimes react with the coffee, causing it to become bitter. Note: a fine mesh strainer will also remove some of the coffee particles, which is not necessarily a bad thing.","Start with a good pour over filter holder, preferably one made of borosilicate glass, and filters especially designed for pour over coffee, such as cone filters. Use a medium-coarse grind of coffee beans, and use filtered water instead of regular tap water. The recommended ratio for coffee to water is 1:15, which means for every 1 gram of coffee, use 15 grams of water. Pour the water over the ground coffee in a circular motion, with a first pour just wetting the coffee grounds, and a second pour slow and steady until to reach the correct ratio.

Which is better - skiing or snowboarding,"Skiing and Snowboarding are both great fun and are enjoyed by millions of people around the world. 

They both rely on the same set of basic skills, mainly the ability to stop and change direction, however, while Snowboarding is a rougher sport as the user is more so on a slope than on a flat surface.

Both sports use specialized equipment, which includes skis, snowboards, and bindings. The main difference between the two sports is the way the user stands on the slope.

Both sports use the same type of terrain, known as a run, and the same basic jumps, called boxes.

The price of Skiing and Snowboarding equipment is similar.","I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. 

Expediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.",0.830664,0.996964,5.980373,0.834209,0.856119,1.899666,-5.247288227081299

Write a short story about a person who discovers a bowling ball with special powers to roll strikes every time. The story should include a plot twist and a clear resolution at the end.,"When I was 12, my neighbor gave me a bowling ball as a joke. I was so excited to finally own a ball worth a damn. I took it to my local alley, and walked up to the counter. I showed the lady my bowling ball, and she said I could bowl for free for the first time. I was finally going to show everyone my gift. 

As I bowled, I felt incredible. The ball seemed to understand my every move, and followed my every command. I didn't have to think about what I wanted it to do. It was almost as if the ball was enjoying the game. I bowled a 180, all strikes. I couldn't believe it. 

The most amazing part was that the ball cost me nothing. My neighbor had given it to me because he knew I'd be able to make a lot of money with it. I showed the ball off to all of my friends and family, and they couldn't believe the way it was bowling. I was a bowling genius.

One night, I took my bowling ball to the alley. As I walked up to the counter, I felt a sudden jolt of electricity. I looked down, and the counter was gone. Instead, a small trapdoor opened, and a man in a suit stepped down. He introduced himself as ""Bowler Man,"" and offered me a job. 

Bowler Man said I could help him find supernatural bowling balls all over the world, and keep a collection of them at my local alley. He said if I had the right skill set, I could make a lot of money. I agreed to his offer, and learned all the tricks of the trade. 

A few years later, I had collected a large collection of supernatural bowling balls. I was finally making the money I'd dreamed of, and I had a family to show for it. One night, I went to the alley. I was bowling a strike, when I heard a loud crack. The ball shot out of my hand, and shot across the alley. I ran after it, but it was too late. It had slammed into the pins and knocked them all down. I was shocked. The ball didn't like me, and wasn't going to let me get away with cheating. 

I had to admit, that was kind of cool. I'd found a new source of power, and could make a lot more money. I was going to have to be careful though. The ball had a strong sense","It seemed like any other day as Kyle and Jeff headed to Airway Lanes for a fun time at the bowling alley. While meticulously looking over house balls with fingertip grips to feel like the pros, Jeff found one that caught his eye. The beautiful blue ball, with pink swirls and matching holes, already somehow had his same initials carved in.

As the two began to bowl, Jeff started with a strike. ""Oh, I like this one,"" he thought. Another strike! ""I could get used to this,"" he told himself.

Kyle was also bowling well, notching a strike and a 9-spare but nothing like what Jeff was doing on the lanes this fateful afternoon.

As Jeff lined up for his 3rd roll, his palms started sweating. The dreaded Turkey is where he got stuck so many times. But not today... ANOTHER STRIKE! Jeff jumped for joy. 

The two would go on to bowl their best games ever, a perfect 300 for Jeff and 279 for Kyle",0.66807,0.999486,22.488882,0.991294,0.706017,5.17075,-4.071792125701904

Extract the creator of Amdahl's law from the Wikipedia paragraph.,"Amdahl's law, also known as Amdahl's theorem or simply Amdahl's law, is an engineering theorem in computer science, computer architecture, and data processing; it represents an important principle of supercomputing design. It states that a system will be slower than the fastest component in the system. In other words, the aggregate speed of a system is the slowest component of the system.

Amdahl's law has been cited in a number of technical discussions about supercomputing architecture and design. It is often used to argue that general-purpose processors are obsolete in supercomputing applications because of their slow speed, and that specialized architectures like graphics processing units (GPUs) or field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are more efficient. However, this is not always the case: current application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are often faster than GPUs in supercomputing workflows, and in some applications, such as scientific computing, FPGAs can be faster than ASICs.","The Wikipedia paragraph does not specify the creator of Amdahl's law.

It helps them to understand the story by hearing the words and tunes repeated over and over. It also helps them to gain an understanding of words and sentences. This helps them to build their vocabulary and their reading comprehension.,"Reading to your kids benefits both the kids and yourself! Children learn empathy, expand their vocabulary, become better listeners develop their imagination by listening to the stories and creating their own vision in their minds. They also develop new skills based on the content of the books. For example, they will learn how the human body works if you read them books about body parts; they will understand emotions better if you introduce them to cute picture books on feelings.

What should I consider before taking a job with a lot of travel?,"It depends on the travel nature and the duration of the trips. If the travel is related to work, then you need to consider different aspects like:

the time zone of the location
duration of stay
number of nights
cost

For trips of a week or more, it's important to consider also the physical distance between your home and the destination. If the travel is related to pleasure, make sure you factor in the time and cost. Also, think about the type of activities you prefer and the type of accommodation you like. In short, decide what is important to you and think about what is a reasonable compromise between the two.","Many people are attracted to jobs that have significant travel.  The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?

What is a good way to get around without a car?,"Getting around without a car in Hong Kong could be a pain. Even walking short distances can be time-consuming. There are two public transportation options: MTR and bus.

MTR is the rapid transit network in Hong Kong. It has multiple lines at different levels, and different types of trains. It is very convenient as it connects many parts of the city and is easy to navigate. The ticket prices are inexpensive compared to major cities in the world.

The bus system is more for local travel. It is faster and cheaper than the MTR. There are buses on most streets, and you can usually see the destination by looking at a nearby stop (for example, ""Cheung Sha Wan"" means the stop after the Cheung Sha Wan Pier). It is easy to get to areas not near a MTR station; however, the bus stop is not always easy to see from a distance, and it can be difficult to find your destination if you get on the wrong bus.","If you live in a city you can access public transport such as buses and trains.

Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.  Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.,"The economic incentives of capitalism have led to the creation and growth of many powerful and successful companies.  Unfortunately, these same incentives have also led to unscrupulous business practices that have damaged the fabric of society.  Because of this, there has been a movement towards better corporate governance in the United States and many other countries.  The goal of good corporate governance is to align the financial interests of managers with the long-term interests of shareholders.  

For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed in the United States to prevent fraud by requiring publicly traded companies to disclose material information about their businesses.  This law has been criticized as increasing costs and reducing productivity for American businesses, but the law has been a success in terms of deterring fraud.  

Another example of good corporate governance is the establishment of the board of directors.  Typically, a corporation is required to have a board of at least a majority of directors who are not employees or affiliates of the company.  The board of directors is responsible for hiring a CEO who is ultimately responsible for the operations of the company.  The board of directors is also responsible for establishing policies for the operations of the company.  The board routinely holds meetings and receives advice from executive management and independent outside counsel.  The board meets with the CEO and other executives to review the operations of the business on a regular basis.  The board also holds the CEO accountable for the financial performance of the company.  Sarbanes-Oxley has increased the costs of running a business, but the board of directors has been shown to be an effective check on the excesses of management.  

Good corporate governance is important not only for ensuring the long-term success of businesses, but also for protecting the public from fraud.  If the board of directors is well-informed of the actions of the CEO, then the board can take appropriate action if the CEO engages in fraudulent conduct.  Similarly, if the board can identify fraud by the CEO, the board should bring the problem to the attention of the board of directors and take action if the CEO does not stop the fraudulent conduct.  

Good corporate governance is not perfect.  Corporate scandals can still happen, but the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has made it much more difficult for CEOs to perpetrate fraud.","To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to

1. Limit multitasking: While it may feel more productive, you can easily get distracted and spend more time on those tasks overall. Instead, try to complete one task to a higher standard in less time.
2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.

"In football, if touchdowns is the main way to get points, why can't the quarterback always throw the ball to the end zone every time?","He can, but that results in a 100% success percentage. When points are scored, the team needs all the other ways they can get them.","To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. 
At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass.

Why is India Pale Ale (IPA) the best type of beer?,"India Pale Ale (IPA) is the best beer style for a number of reasons. First, it has a lot of hops in it, which give it its characteristic bitterness and aroma. Second, it is typically hopped in England with a whole slew of hops from the mountains of the British Isles, giving it a citrusy character. Third, it was introduced into India during the British Raj, where it was first served to the British soldiers who were stationed in that country. The climate and soil created by the Himalayas in India is very similar to the British Isles, so the hops from the British Isles would thrive in India. This gave the Indian beer brewers a new ingredient to use in brewing beer and created India's version of India Pale Ale. The best India Pale Ales are world renowned for their hop character and bitterness.","India Pale Ales (IPAs) are an ideal type of beer for both producers and drinkers for a variety of reasons.

Producers like IPAs because they are cheap and fast to produce compared to other types of beers.  In contrast to a lager, an IPA can be brewed and ready for market in less than half the time.

Drinkers like IPAs for their complex flavors which can vary depending on style from East Coast or West Cost, dry hopped or hazy.  Additionally, IPA often have a higher alcohol content than many other similar beers - which lends to a higher ""band for buck"" value.",0.873609,0.999269,6.909941,0.958052,0.909378,2.13005,-3.587449550628662

Q:

Javascript not executing when loading from remote server

I've got a rather odd problem. I have a fairly simple script that I use to insert a photo in an email template. 
var img = document.createElement('img');
img.src = 'https://www.example.com/image.jpg';
img.onload = function() {
    console.log('Image loaded!');
}

document.body.appendChild(img);

This code works great when I run it in my local environment. When I deploy to a remote server, however, the image isn't inserted into the template. I've tried using a different server as well but I still get the same result.
Is there any reason why this code would not be executing when it is loaded from a remote server?

write short essay on Buzz Aldrin experience on moon,"Buzz Aldrin experience on moon is one of the significant moments in the space journey history. He was the second person to set foot on the moon. His famous words - ""One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" - has been remembered for long and made him an inspiration to many. While on the moon's surface, Aldrin believed that mankind's first steps towards the space were taken.

Aldrin's experience on the moon was full of ups and downs. Due to a technical snag, he was the first human to set foot on the moon, only to see another person on the moon. He was so focused that he did not realise that another person was also on the moon. He had to explain to NASA officials that he did not mean to land on the moon before Mike, to his surprise. While he was on the moon, he had to confront a few life-threatening situations. He had to use a coat hanger to activate a solar panel and used a pen to trigger a self-destruct mechanism of the lander. He had to take shelter in the lunar module and used a flashlight to find his way inside. Despite all these challenges, Aldrin's experience on the moon is considered as a great achievement in the history of space exploration.","Buzz Aldrin, the second person to step onto the Moon's surface after Neil Armstrong, had a unique experience during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Like Armstrong, Aldrin spent just over two hours outside the lunar module, conducting experiments and collecting samples.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was both exhilarating and challenging. He described the lunar landscape as ""magnificent desolation,"" with vast, barren plains and towering mountains in the distance. Aldrin also noted the difficulty of moving around in the bulky spacesuit and the constant hissing sound of his oxygen supply.

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration. He, along with Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 team, pushed the boundaries of what was possible and opened up new frontiers for science and discovery.

Summarize Romania's history and founding.,"Romania was formed by the union of historic Transylvania, Bukovina and northern Wallachia in 1859 as a result of the Napoléonic Code du Haut-Rhin, which was inspired by the French Revolution. The new country was granted independence from Russia following the battle of St. Gotthard in 1859, although Transylvania was returned to Hungary in return for Bukovina. Following more victories over the Austro-Hungarians, and despite initial opposition from the German empire, World War I led to its union with Transylvania, Maramures and Oltenia to form modern-day Romania.

"Write a short story about a young aboriginal man seeking guidance on his place in the world.  Have him consult a wise elder, who will share wisdom and perspective.","Kwok was a young man, who had grown up on a remote island.  He had been raised by his grandparents, and they had taught him about the ways of the elders.  They taught him to be proud of who he was, and that he had a responsibility to look after the needs of the tribe.  He was taught that his role was to be a provider, and that he had a responsibility to provide for his family.  

Kwok's grandparents taught him to respect the land, and to protect it.  They taught him about the importance of the water and the trees, and of sharing with others.  They taught him the value of family, and of following the ways of the elders.

Kwok was only a boy, but he knew he had to make a decision.  He knew that he was a Kwok, and that he belonged with his family.  He decided that he must go to the mainland to find his true family, and to learn about his place in the world.  

Kwok packed what he could carry, and walked for many days.  He walked until he could no longer walk.  He walked until he could no longer walk, and his grandparents had to help him.  They took him in and cared for him, and taught him the ways of the Kwok.  

Kwok's journey had not been easy, but it had changed his life.  He learned the value of family, and of the land.  He learned that his true family were on the mainland, and that he had been searching for far too long.  Kwok was now ready to grow up and take his place as a Kwok.  He looked after his family, and protected the land.","The young man stood apart from the other young men and watched them tease the girls and play around in general.
He sighed deeply. ""Why am I so shy?"", he asked himself: ""Why can't I join in the games like the others?"" The young man had asked himself these questions many times, and each time the answer was the same. He just didn't know. Was it that he felt that he was not worthy? Hardly. He was a kind and respectful person, and, he had to admit, a fine hunter. So what was wrong with him? He decided to speak to the Koradji, the wise man. Surely he would know. The Koradji was peering into his fire, deep in thought, when the young man approached, but somehow knew of his presence. ""You are troubled,"" he asked and continued to gaze into the fire. ""I seek vour wisdom, Uncle,"" he replied, his voice hardly more than a whisper. ""Wisdom comes at a price"" said the Koradji, without raising his head.

What are Salesforce's Inc current state and challenges?,"Salesforce has gained significant traction in the CRM space and is currently the leader in the market. However, the company has faced significant challenges in recent years due to both internal and external factors.

Salesforce has a large and diverse workforce spread across various geographies globally. In the recent times, the company has made efforts to hire more women and people from diverse backgrounds to enhance its diversity ratio. However, this has been met with some criticism as the numbers don't show the actual picture.

Salesforce acquired a lot of companies over the years and many of them were not performing well financially. Salesforce has been criticized for its inability to effectively manage its acquired companies and its acquisition strategy has been questioned multiple times.","Salesforce can be best described as being in the “Elaboration” stage within the organization's lifecycle. Salesforce, to date, has managed its growth very well. Despite growing to 17000 employees, Salesforce managed to retain its core culture. It also responded to external challenges, especially against the competition, as Salesforce today competes in the CRM industry and emerged as a viable alternative to AWS. Salesforce relies more heavily on bureaucratic control mechanisms than clan and market control. Salesforce divided itself into functional units, namely, Product, Customer, People, Strategy, and Revenue. It does have some core focus areas, like the public sector as an industry vertical. Even though Salesforce, when viewed through a rational lens, is a bureaucratic organization, it is designed for flexibility, i.e, organic design. The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management.

Why is the Pacific ocean typically cold off of the West Coast of the United States?,"The Pacific ocean off of the West Coast of the United States is typically cold because of two main currents.  The northeast Pacific current, which travels from the North Pacific down the west coast of South America, crosses the Americas and then flows into the Pacific northwest of the United States.  This current tends to push the waters toward the west toward the coast of South America.  The second current is the Kuroshio Current, which flows from the east along the west coast of North America and then turns slightly northward.  This current flows along the west coast of North America in a broad band that extends all the way from the Canadian border to the International Date Line.  It is this current that flows along the west coast of the United States and then turns westward off the coast of South America and continues on to push waters toward the west off of the United States.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.
A pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.

Fees:
Both clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.

Write me a poem about data,"Here is a poem about data.

Data is merely information, though sometimes it's a lot more.
    It's useless without meaning and context.
    Data is only as valuable as the knowledge we glean from it.
    Some say it's a matter of choice, but only if you believe ignorance is bliss.

See how quickly we turned into drumbeats?
    Data is just a bunch of numbers and symbols.
    It's the stories we tell ourselves about what it means
    that makes data matter.
    Our decisions are based on it, our lives are guided by it.
    We can't escape it, so we might as well embrace it.

We can't deny its power, nor can we deny its pitfalls.
    It's an asset when used correctly, but a liability when abused.
    We're obsessed with it, obsessed with what it can do.
    We forget that it's just a tool, so treat it with respect.
    It's a force for good and that's why it's on the rise.
    We can't ignore it, it's a fundamental part of our world.

So the next time you feel overwhelmed by data, remember:
    Information is not data.
    Data is not knowledge.
    Knowledge is not wisdom.
    Wisdom is not truth.
    Truth is not love.
    Love is not life.
    Life is not happiness.
    Happiness is not love.
    Love is not data.","Data is big
Data is great
Data must stand
Or endeavour a fate

Where knowledge can't roost 
And fall victim you may

What are the three main states of matter and how does it transition between them?,"The three main states of matter are a solid, a liquid, and a gas. A state of matter is determined by a substance's behavior under certain conditions. A substance in a liquid or gas state will change to another state of matter based on the pressure or temperature of its environment. For example, water, when in a solid state, is not able to change to a liquid or gas state. Water in a solid state can be transformed to a liquid state by applying pressure to it (e.g., putting a stone on top of a block of ice). Water in a liquid state can then transition to a gas state by reducing its pressure.","The three main states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter consumes energy as it changes state from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. When matter changes from gas to liquid or liquid to solid, it releases energy.

How is the white color created?,"The pigment Cadmium White is added to the color paint, then the mixture is stirred to ensure that it is evenly distributed.","The color white is created when all colors in the visible spectrum are combined in equal amounts. This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

In the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity.

Rugs made out of synthetic materials are easier to cut since they do not need special processing to stop them from getting unthreaded. You should draw an outline on the back on the rug and use a very sharp cutter to trace it. To prevent damage while cutting, you can put a regular kitchen cutting board under your work area.

"Given this paragraph about time travel, how practical is it","It is not practical to travel in time as we understand it, but it is theoretically possible. Any travel into the past would require the time traveller to travel faster than the speed of light, which is a speed that no physical object can exceed. This means that while the time traveller appears to be travelling backwards in time, they are in fact travelling forwards in time, but at a rate that is faster than the speed of light. This would mean that they would age before they get to where they are going, as they would have already got there in the past.","Yes, time travel is indeed a real thing.

What is the key to longevity?,"Longevity seems to be associated with a life of relative good health and avoidance of chronic disease. Good diet and exercise are very important. Still, the central precepts of traditional Chinese medicine also hold much promise: avoid internal heat (e.g., from stress, tobacco, or overeating), stay calm, and do not become too stressed out.","Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. 
Researchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of.

Why is film photography popular again?,The rise of social media has made people appreciate the art of taking a well composed and well exposed photo more than before.,"Film photography had seen a long decline in popularity ever since the invention of digital cameras with their remarkable leaps in technological advances. As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks.

Jaromir Jagr is another top player in the NHL, though his career overlapped with Gretzky's era.  Jagr often plays a similar style of hockey, but is less known for his passing and his ability to drive play.  Bobby Orr is widely considered to be the best player to ever play the game of ice hockey.  Orr's consistent use of theelo rink and his defensive play are considered to be a cornerstone of hockey.  Orr's style was also aggressive, leading to several fights in which he was not involved.  Mario Lemieux is often considered the greatest player in the history of the NHL.  Lemieux was able to transform a poor Pittsburgh Penguins team to a Stanley Cup champion in just a few years, largely because of his ability to drive play with his speed.

What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a type of genetic association study that searches for genetic variations that are associated with many cases of a particular disease or disorder compared to a low number of cases for healthy people (controls). Genome-wide association studies use a technique called genetic association, in which many genetic markers (such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) across the entire genome are compared between cases and controls.","In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease.

At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. It also increased the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent.
Global inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains elevated in many economies. It will be some time before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.
The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to both global developments and softer demand in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to be around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.
Growth in"," wages remains strong and there is some evidence that this is starting to filter through into higher prices.
Rates are set to move little over the coming year.
The Board will continue to monitor inflation developments closely, and will be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy if necessary to support sustainable growth in the economy and maintain inflation at 2 per cent on an average over the year, over and above any temporary effects from changes in exchange rates.

Why is it important to hug your child?,"Children need to be hugged. There is no getting around that. When we talk about the importance of hugging children, we mean it in more than a metaphorical sense. It is not an exaggeration to say that a child's physical and emotional health is directly linked to the frequency and duration of hugs they receive. As it turns out, researchers have found that for children who do not receive hugs on a regular basis, their development can be hindered in a variety of harmful ways. They are less likely to behave well in school and more likely to engage in aggressive behavior, suffer from depression, and have trouble forming close friendships.

On the other hand, when children are regularly given hugs, their development is enhanced in a multitude of positive ways. For example, they are less anxious and more resilient. They are less likely to engage in substance abuse. They are more likely to engage in healthy living and practice good hygiene.

The list goes on. The bottom line is that hugs matter, and it is important for parents to provide their children with hugs on a regular basis. That is why it is important to hug your child.","Hugs can help your child grow a healthy brain and body.

Why democracy doesn't works and in old times we had autocracy?,Democracy is a form of government where all the individuals in a society has an equal say and have an equal opportunity to participate in government by electing representatives to make decisions on their behalf. The problem with democracy is that everyone does not have the same knowledge and education to participate in the decision making as well as they have not equal voice to influence the decision makers. It results in inefficient decision making and the society is dominated by a small group of people who knows how to influence decision makers. The society who have autocracy in the past understood the problem of democracy better and they used to have autocracy where a small group of people have the full power and all the individuals have no say in their decision making.,"Corruption, polarization, and misinformation all have the potential to easily influence democracy, which is a complicated system with many moving parts. It additionally will in general be sluggish and wasteful because of the requirement for agreement building and split the difference among various groups.

On the other hand, because there is no need to engage in a prolonged decision-making process or accommodate divergent viewpoints, autocracy can be more effective and decisive in implementing policies.

How does the Stock Market work?,"The stock market is a marketplace for companies to sell their stocks.  Individual investors can buy shares of companies in the stock market.  The supply and demand of a company's stock is determined by the investment capital of a buyer and seller.  The value of a stock can go up and down based on the market demand and supply.  High demand for stock can increase the value of a stock, whereas, increasing supply or decreasing demand can decrease the value of a stock.  The stock market is a very important component of the economy of the United States.","The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.",0.923247,0.993716,5.902005,0.853242,0.924881,1.919418,-3.688472270965576

What is oxidation reduction potential?,Oxidation reduction potential is the change in oxidation state of an atom or a molecule as it transfers from a reducing agent to an oxidizing agent.,"Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water.",0.903734,0.995553,0.998744,0.046131,0.896413,0.768115,-2.94880747795105

"I want to try shooting sports, Can you throw some light on this using the given text as a reference?","Since the time a gun is cocked, the bullet has to travel along the barrel from the point of ignition to the point of impact. With a small bullet, it travels at a high velocity. When the bullet leaves the barrel, it travels at a slower velocity due to drag. 

This slower velocity of bullet is called the bullet's exit velocity. A good shooting distance is between 300 and 400 yards. Because the bullet travels a longer distance, the bullet needs more time to decelerate. 

This is where the use of a heavy bullet comes in. You can create a larger bullet that travels a longer distance, but at the same time, has a high drag. This creates a faster deceleration of the bullet, and gives the shooter more control over the bullet. 

One more thing to consider is that the trajectory of the bullet is not a perfect straight line. This is due to the wind, and other external factors.","1. A group of competitive and leisure sports activities is referred to as shooting sports.

Why do humans like stories?,"Humans like stories for a number of reasons.  Most people like stories because they allow the listener to experience the actions of another person in a different time and place.  This can be a comforting thought when the listener is feeling afraid, lonely, or in some other situation where there is a lot of uncertainty.  Stories also allow the listener to experience emotions that the listener cannot experience in the current situation.  By allowing the listener to engage with the characters in a story, the listener can also engage with emotions that are not his or her own.  Stories can be especially comforting in times of loss or grief because they allow us to engage with and share in the joy of the person who has died.","Stories allow conveying important thoughts and sharing experiences from one person to another in an easily understandable and relatable way, ultimately leading to knowledge transfer between humans.

where is India,"Indian Subcontinent, the land comprising the countries known before the 10th century as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, all of which were once a single country called India. The term “Indian subcontinent” was first used by the English poet and writer William Jones in 1786, although the region had been inhabited for many millennia and had been formally called the “South Sea” by the Portuguese in the 15th century.

From the beginning of the 7th century A.D., the region was conquered and controlled by a series of Muslim dynasties, which included the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, the Maratha Empire, and the British Empire and its successor nations. The modern nation of Pakistan was born from the British Indian Empire in 1947, when West Pakistan was divided by the Indian National Congress party, led by Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, to create the independent nation of India. In 1971, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) declared independence from Pakistan, and the resulting conflict (1965-present) has resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 to 300,000 people and the displacement of 200 million. In 1971, the new nation of Bangladesh was created by partitioning the country of Pakistan, and millions of people have been displaced or have fled to neighboring India. Nepal, known before the 10th century as “Narayani” and “Naradewa,” was governed as a Hindu kingdom for many centuries, but it was conquered by the Malla king Shanka Malla in the 13th century. It was subsequently governed as a Hindu kingdom and a Muslim kingdom, and was conquered by the Shah kings of the Thakuri clan in the 16th century. The Shah kings adopted Hinduism as the state religion in 1563.

Give me some tips for cooking the best bolognese sauce.,"There are several factors that can make or break a bolognese sauce.  The first factor is the quality of the meat.  The best cut of meat for a bolognese is veal shoulder, as it has a very fine yet tender texture.  Second, it is very important that you brown the meat in a good quality lard, as this will develop the fond (the delicious crispy bits on the bottom of the pan) in the pan.  You should also use salt pork for color and flavor.  Lastly, make sure you use a red wine, which will balance the strong flavor of the pork.  A bottle that is at least 15 years old is ideal.","In order to cook bolognese sauce, it is important to use quality ingredients. You're going to need the following: Italian tomato sauce, onion, celery, carrot, minced meat, extra virgin olive oil, salt, white or red wine and milk. Here are some useful tips:

- Take your time. Cooking a great bolognese sauce takes at least 4 hours. Set the stove level at low.
- Start by cooking the ""sofritto"". This is a mix of chopped onions, celery and carrots. -
- Add the meat to the ""sofritto"". Be sure to seal it so it doesn't leak water into your sauce. 
- Add some wine and boil it completely.
- When there is no liquid left, add the tomato sauce and some water, and cook it for at 3 to 5 hours. You can add more water during the process if needed.",0.770279,0.998835,6.905169,0.625454,0.809846,2.021917,-4.241466999053955

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"The location of Atlanta in the north-eastern part of the state makes it easy to film there, in an urban setting that is very similar to that of the United States. The low tax rates for films also make the state an attractive location.","While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.

What are some creative inspirations for a beginner photographer?,"There are many creative inspirations for a beginner photographer.  Here are a few ideas:
1. Look for scenes with interesting light, composition, and color.
2. Look for subjects that are in motion.
3. Find images on the internet that you like and try to recreate them yourself.
4. Purchase a book on photography and take it to a local park or coffee shop to try out the ideas in person.
5. Create a photo essay based on an event in your life that is interesting and unique.","First and foremost, change the scenery. Travel to a new city. Take a walk in a new neighborhood. Adventure into the nature. A fresh sight to behold may inspire you in ways you never thought would be possible.

Second, vary the lighting conditions. Revisit your familiar photo spots at different hours - during the sunrise, sunset, at noon, in pitch darkness and of course, during the golden hours when the world around you embraces that warm glow.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

However, I also understand that many people would say that the Bible is the greatest book ever written. We should not judge a book by its greatest play because even the greatest plays only tell a small part of the story.","There is no common agreement on which play written by William Shakespeare is the greatest. In total, William Shakespeare wrote approximately 39 plays, each of which can be broadly categorized into three main groups: histories, comedies and tragedies. Henry V and Richard III are regarded amongst his finest histories, both featuring an English king as their eponymous character. The Tempest and A Midsummer Night's Dream are considered to be amongst his best comedies; whilst tragedies were arguably Shakespeare's greatest genre - Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar and King Lear are all amongst his finest contributions to this field.

Explain the best way to swing a golf iron compared to a golf driver.,"Golf drivers are longer than golf irons and are used for longer shots. They are typically used for hitting from the fairway, the green, or a long tee shot, whereas golf irons are used for more shorter shots from the fairway. To hit a golf shot with a driver you would grip the club slightly more loftly than you would for a iron. To hit a ball with a driver you would hit the ball with a backswing and follow through with more of a pushing motion. With an iron you would grip it more firmly, and you would take a smaller backswing, and you would hit the ball with a more side-to-side motion.","When hitting an iron you want to make a downward striking motion in the grass.

Should we all use Qubes OS for most daily task that involve the internet?,"No, it is too hard to set up and use.  Generally, you should only use Qubes OS for tasks where your system is not trustworthy. For example, if you are a developer or security researcher, you should use Qubes OS to help ensure that you are not infected with malware that compromises your system.

I set up Qubes OS many years ago.  It is not trivial, and I don't recommend that most people set it up.  If you are not a geek and you are concerned about security or privacy, you might want to use a less complex system, such as Deep Security or grsecurity. The benefit of a more complex system is that you can be reasonably sure that your system is not compromised, but you lose some of the benefits of a simple system like Qubes OS.

If you are willing to set up and use a more complex system, I recommend that you try Deep Security.  Deep Security is more complex than Qubes OS, but Deep Security has better security than most other highly configurable systems.  It also doesn't require you to set up a network isolated from your real network.  Deep Security is also easy to use, which is a benefit for most complex security systems.  Deep Security has a free tier, so you can evaluate Deep Security to see if it is a good fit for you.

It is important to get your child the right amount of nutrients and not too much or too little.

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.

 - Nutrients.  Fertilizers may aid in the early stages.  Be sure to read the manufacturers label and instructions before application.

What is the main benefit of the fianchetto in chess openings?,"The fianchetto is a common chess opening move in the King's Indian Defense and the French Defense. It is named after the ""fianchetto"" or ""fianchettoed"" position, in which the king is placed on a file next to a pawn, that is then moved to the adjacent side of the king's former square, thus positioning the pawn directly into the position of the king's former eponymous square.

The main benefit of the fianchetto is its ability to create a kingside attack, either direct or via a file, against an unsuspecting opponent. By moving the king's file to the kingside, the fianchettoed position creates a forward-facing moveable target for any piece on the opponent's side of the board. In the King's Indian Defense, the kingside attack leads to the creation of a variation known as the Grünfeld Defense, which is well known for its high-class players such as Alekhine, Keres, Botvinnik, and Smyslov. In the French Defense, the kingside attack leads to the creation of the French Defense Anagram, a sharp opening with a reputation for being short and sharp.","The fianchetto follows the ""hypermodern"" opening philosophy.

How can you take good star photos?,"The best way to get a good star photo is to go out at night, look up, and wait for a clear sky. 
Use a telescope or binoculars to find something interesting to look at, and wait for the right moment to take the photo. 
Some tips:

Use a tripod, so that the camera doesn't move when the photo is taken. 
Use a remote to take the photo. 
Ensure there is adequate light on both the star and the camera's sensor. 
Avoid having any clouds or light from lights in the photo.
Avoid using filters on the camera's lens.
Avoid having the camera's lens very close to the sensor.
Avoid having any distracting elements in the photo, such as trees, houses, people, or cars. 
Avoid taking the photo while moving. 
Avoid taking the photo right when the photo is taken, as you will probably get an effect called star trail. 
Have fun and enjoy the moment","Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky",0.693504,0.997081,10.685532,0.727627,0.758513,2.772451,-5.522311687469482

What is sourdough bread?,"Sourdough bread is made from a sourdough starter.  The sourdough starter is a fermented flour, water, and yeast mixture that is prepared days before the bread is baked.  The starter is fed, and then after several hours of feeding, more flour is added to it.  As the sourdough bread bakes, the acid in the flour and water reaction activates and creates a sour taste to the bread.","Sourdough bread does not use yeast to rise.

Give me a concise summary of the history of baseball,"Baseball was invented in the 19th century in American towns and cities across the United States. The sport's development was based on the rules established by the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABB). The NABBP was founded in 1855. The first official national baseball championship was held in 1858 and was called the National Association Championship.

The National League and American Association merged in 1900 to form the National League of Professional Ball Players (NLPB). The NLPB was led by Andrew Freedman. This league disbanded after the 1903 season.

The major leagues were formed in 1876 when the National League and the American Association merged. This league was called the National League (NL). The NL's first champion was the  Philadelphia Phillies.

Why do so many people say it is special to be a grandparent?,"Being a grandparent is special in part because of the amazing joy it brings to experience the love and laughter of our grandchildren.  This joy is also enhanced by the increasing awareness of the value of social connectedness and the re-evaluation of one's life.  Grandparents who are fortunate to experience both of these often describe their lives as being re-energized, redefined and re-defined for a 3rd time as the years go by.  They describe feeling like they were put on this earth for a reason and that they are fulfilling a higher purpose.","Many people say that being a grandparent is special.  They say it is special being a grandparent for a variety of reasons.  One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, ""I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.""  Having this love for another is a key factor in why it is special to be a grandparent.",0.854119,0.998846,3.764888,0.778211,0.875418,1.454296,-3.7526590824127197

Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual.

What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?,"The left side of the brain is associated with logical, linear thought, while the right side of the brain is more associated with creative, holistic thought.","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.943582,0.99552,0.998273,0.165026,0.934792,0.807439,-3.0712409019470215
What is a bond in finance?,A bond is a contract between a borrower and a lender.,"In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stock",0.907511,0.983918,0.997959,0.048701,0.899671,0.767552,-2.6593177318573

Does a difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups from a credit scoring algorithm constitute a bias in the data collection process or the algorithm itself?,"We believe the difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups is more likely related to the credit scoring algorithm itself. There are multiple factors that can affect the credit scoring algorithms, including the data it was trained on, the training sample size, the specific machine learning algorithm it used, etc. These factors are generally outside of an individual’s control, and even small differences in these factors can lead to significant differences in the credit scoring results. The database used in the algorithm may not be sufficiently large or diverse enough to capture all the factors that affect the outcomes. It is also possible that the algorithm used made a modeling mistake, and that issue is specific to this model and the specific dataset it was trained on. To eliminate credit scoring bias and ensure fairness, it is important to collect and use data from a sufficiently large and diverse population.","I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in",0.825699,0.999666,5.987256,0.794145,0.856079,1.892569,-3.2449851036071777

"You are a young citizen of a developing country. Write a letter in less than 150 words to a newspaper, highlighting your concern over incorrect disposal of biomedical waste and to spread awareness of the same.","Dear Editor,

We read with great interest the article titled ""Gaseous microsphere radiation exposure of the lung: a potential risk factor in the development of interstitial lung disease"" by Balla et al. ([@bibr1]) published in your esteemed journal. We would like to highlight a few points.

First, the risk of radiation pneumonitis increases with the total dose of radiation received, and this risk increases with the cumulative volume of lung exposed to radiation ([@bibr2]). Our patient received a total dose of 0.5 Gy (0.5 rads) of radiation, which is less than the threshold for the development of radiation pneumonitis. In addition, the volume of lung affected by radiation was less than 2% of the total lung volume, which is much less than the threshold volume for the development of radiation pneumonitis.

Second, the development of radiation pneumonitis is more common in the setting of underlying lung disease, such as sarcoidosis or cystic fibrosis, and less common among those with normal lung. The patient in this case report had no underlying lung disease, and the development of radiation pneumonitis is less common.

Third, the development of radiation pneumonitis is also more common in the setting of chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The patient did not receive any chemotherapy or stem cell transplant, and the development of radiation pneumonitis is even less common.

Finally, the treatment for radiation pneumonitis is only supportive, and the development of radiation pneumonitis does not preclude patients from receiving radiation therapy.

In conclusion, the development of radiation pneumonitis in the setting of 0.5 Gy (0.5 rads) of radiation to the lung is extremely rare and the development of radiation pneumonitis is more common in the setting of underlying lung disease or the presence of chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The development of radiation pneumonitis in the setting of 0.5 Gy (0.5 rads) of radiation to the lung is extremely rare and the development of radiation pneumonitis is more common in the setting of underlying lung disease or the presence of chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?,"Composing music is a creative process and there is no required knowledge to get started. However, an understanding of the modes of music theory, interval relationships, harmony and key centers is necessary to create a well-structured composition.","Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

Is the Cordyceps fungus from The Last of US real?,"No, The Last of US is a Netflix fictional series.

The Cordyceps fungus is a real organism from the genus Cordyceps and the family Clavicipitaceae. The Cordyceps fungus is a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and a insect host. The insect provides a host for the cordyceps fungus to grow out of its head and then the fungus obtains nutrients and water from the host's excrement. The fungus then extends mycelia, or fungal threads, from the head of the insect into the surrounding soil to search for more hosts. The Last of US is inspired by the Cordyceps fungus and its relationship with a human host.","Yes, Cordyceps is a real fungus naturally occurring in nature. However, unlike its portrayal in the The Last of Us videogames and TV show adaptation by HBO it can not infect humans and is in fact often used in medicinal supplements and even eaten as food.

How do you explain cloud computing to a 5 year old?,Cloud computing is basically using the internet to get everything for free.  If you need a computer that's designed for cloud computing then that's how you explain it to a 5 year old.  You can say that you get everything you need from the internet so you don't need to have a computer that is specifically designed to use the internet.,Imagine you are building some thing using lego pieces. All of your legos are in basket.  As you start to build your desired structure you start to take 1-3 or couple of handful of legos from the basket. As you start to give some shape to the structure you are designing you start to put back some of the legos into the basket you don't need. Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket). As your application needs compute resources to meet the demand; you borrow compute resources from the cloud providers data center and give it back when you don't need it.,0.959065,0.999048,2.988294,0.776633,0.960228,1.336654,-3.2759974002838135

Who is Mother Teresa?,"Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was an Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She was born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu in Skopje, the daughter of Simeon Natcho and Eudoxia Bojaxhiu. Her father was of Serbian descent and her mother was of Albanian descent. Her baptismal name was Teresa.

She was first sent to live with her uncle in Tiruchirapalli (now known as Trichinopoly) and then to a convent school in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta). It was at the school that she developed her love of and vocation to missionary work.

She entered the Louise F. Rockefeller Institute of Medical Sciences in 1913, where she studied for her MD and interned at the Calcutta General Hospital. She was confirmed and married at the age of 17.

In 1929, she became involved in the care of the poor and unfortunate in the slums of Kolkata. Over the next several years she established the Missionaries of Charitable Love, also known as the Missionaries of Charity. She was known as Mother Teresa from her confirmation in 1933.

In 1941, she went to live permanently in the Missionaries of Charitable Love Mother House in Kolkata. She established 67 houses of sisters in 12 different countries around the world.

Why do we love green,"The colour green has been associated with Nature throughout human history. It is derived from the colour of growing crops, it symbolises prosperity, and it is the second least used of the standard RGB colour model colours. It is no surprise that the colour green is associated with Nature, as it is a colour that is associated with growth, renewal and life. Of the 254 colours that can be created from the primary colours of Red, Green and Blue, only two - black and white - have been used by humans to express their ideas and emotions.

The colour green has also been linked to Nature because it is the colour of grass and trees, which are a key part of any ecosystem. For humans, we identify with the animals and plants around us and seeing them in their natural environment helps us to appreciate them more. It is no surprise, then, that the slogan ""Go green"" is so popular, as it is intended to encourage people to be more environmentally friendly and to appreciate the natural world around them.

The science behind why we love green

The British Psychological Society has determined that so-called ""cool"" hues, such as green, blue and purple, are more calming than ""warm"" colours, such as red and yellow. Cool colours are also associated with the immune system, so they are thought to be good for your health. Additionally, the ""greeny"" shades are considered to be more attractive to the human eye than other colours.

A study from researchers at the University of California (Irvine) further explored the connection between colour and mood. The researchers found that cool colours, such as green, blue, purple and grey, are preferred by people in a state of relaxation or reflection, while warm colours, such as orange, red and yellow, are preferred by people in a state of excitement. The researchers also determined that the correlation between hue and mood is universal; that is, regardless of culture or geography, people prefer the colours of the rainbow to those of the classical schoolroom, and prefer the colours of nature to those of urban life.

A study from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom looked at the physiological impact of colour on the human heart. The study found that warm colours, such as red, yellow and orange, trigger the ""fight or flight"" response in the human body, while cool colours, such as blue, green and purple, trigger the ""rest and digest"" response. The findings from this study may help to explain why the colour green is so popular",Because Green is good for our eyes. and that makes our life pretty,0.294325,0.997961,15.50215,0.987396,0.373706,3.631107,-4.233640670776367

Tell me a story,"Well, as I was growing up I always had this dream of traveling the world. And in my dream, I would visit every continent. At first, I would only go to the continents that I could actually visit by foot. But as I got older, I decided to make my dream a reality.

I started by planning my trip. I would fly to the first continent that I couldn't reach by foot - South America, using frequent flyer miles that I had saved up. I would then take a boat from the first continent to the second - Africa to Asia, until I reached the last continent, Antarctica, by ice floe.

After I finished my dream trip, I realized that it would have been impossible to do it by myself. I would therefore need to find a travel partner to make my dream come true. I found the best travel partner in the world, my father.

I could never travel the world alone. But with my father by my side, I would be able to fulfill my dream. And I would be able to remember my father every step of the way.","Everyone carries an invisible bucket.

Explain gravity,Gravity is a force that acts on all particles regardless of mass or size. Earth's gravity is created by its mass and stores energy from the sun.,"Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.95432,0.992092,1.9931,0.638448,0.948335,1.105259,-3.9787495136260986

Gender - Research has shown that Alzheimer's disease is slightly more common in men than in women.

Family history - If a close relative (e.g. a parent or sibling) has Alzheimer's disease, there's a higher risk that you'll develop it as well.

Head trauma - If you've experienced a head injury that caused bleeding or damage to the brain, your risk of Alzheimer's disease may be higher.

Chronic stress - Though the evidence is limited, some studies suggest that chronic stress may increase your risk of Alzheimer's disease.

Obesity - If you're overweight, your risk of developing Alzheimer's disease may be greater. Some studies have shown that losing weight may reduce your risk.","Undrestanding the causes of the Alzheimer's disease is an ongoing research. The research so far indicate that causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.

A case of multiple pituitary hormone deficiency with macroorchidism.
Multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD) is a rare disorder with an increasing incidence. This disorder is caused by a defect in the development of the hypophysis or in the secretion of one or more of the anterior pituitary hormones. A male patient presented to our clinic with primary amenorrhoea, late-onset obesity, infertility, and erectile dysfunction. The magnetic resonance imaging revealed a normal pituitary and a huge suprasellar tumour. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a prolactinoma. The patient was treated with bromocriptine and cabergoline. The tumour decreased in size, and the testosterone and oestradiol levels increased to normal values. In this study we report on a case of MPHD and the first case of macroorchidism in MPHD. The pituitary tumour was successfully treated with dopamine agonists, and the patient's fertility was restored.The present invention relates generally to the field of computer systems, and more particularly to a system and method for automatically generating test data for testing a memory component.
Memory is a valuable resource in any computer system. Memory is used to store instructions that are to be executed by the computer system and data that is to be used by the instructions. In addition, memory is used to store code and data used by the operating system and by the programs and applications that are executing on the computer system.
Computer systems typically include one or more memory components to store instructions and data. The memory components may be one or more separate physical components that are integrated on a single chip along with other components used to execute instructions and to store data. The memory components typically include a memory array in which instructions and data may be stored","The answer is:  the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog

What is bicycling and why would someone do it?  Is bicycling healthy and joyful or is it painful and a waste of time?  How many bicycles should you have?  Which part of the world do you find the most people bicycling?,"Bicycling is a fun and healthy activity that many people do for recreation and transportation.  It is a great way to get exercise, improve your cardiovascular system, and reduce your carbon footprint.  In many metropolitan areas, people ride bikes as a primary means of transportation.  However, in many less developed parts of the world, people ride them as a cheaper and more environmentally friendly way to get around.  Even in highly developed areas, there are still those who bicycle as a sport or because they don't want to drive a car.  While bicycling is great for your health and the environment, it can be dangerous because it is a moving object and people might not be looking where they are going.  So, bicyclists need to follow safety rules outlined in the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices.  But, bicycling is also a great form of exercise and stress relief.","Bicycling is a form of human powered movement that typically involves sitting or standing on a machine with two wheels that can be propelled forward by using one's arms or legs.  The bicycle was invented in the early 1800 (1817) by a German inventor named Drais.  The early bicycles were built from wood and soon after used heavy steel for the frame and wheels.  These steel bikes were called Boneshakers because when you road on them you would feel every stone and bump through your bones.  Bicycling exists in nearly every corner of the world, on every continent and it is done by all people.  In many countries, bicycling is the primary mode of transportation for people, especially in urban settings.  Bicycling is also a professional sporting competition where men and women race against one another in large groups in front of cheering crowds.

Brainstorm reasons for and against taking a daily low-dose aspirin.,"Low-dose aspirin is recommended for individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to its reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Aspirin itself is a benign medication and does not cause serious adverse side effects. This risk is offset by the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.

However, daily low-dose aspirin may also not reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and may cause serious side effects. Therefore, it is recommended only for individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.","According to Berkeley Wellness, there’s evidence that a daily aspirin “protects people already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD).” However, there is insufficient evidence that a daily low-dose aspirin is as effective for primary prevention; it is not as necessarily effective for people who have “not been diagnosed with CVD.” Additionally, high BMI may also alter the way aspirin is metabolized, further complicating the data. Finally, there’s evidence that suddenly stopping aspirin can actually increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

India's Last 10 Prime Ministers,"

This is a list of the last ten prime ministers of India. The office of prime minister has been officially recognised by the constitution of India since 1950, though its current form dates to 1947, when India's independence from Britain was negotiated.

Since independence, fourteen prime ministers have led the national government of India. The office of prime minister is largely a figurehead position with real power usually resting with the cabinet, the collective group of ministers responsible for the government's day-to-day affairs. The prime minister's role is to head the cabinet and present it with a legislative programme, although he or she does not have the power to decide what should be included in that programme. The prime minister also forms the head of government, and must therefore be nominated by the president of India.

The prime minister is the most senior member of the Indian government and the head of government. The current prime minister is Narendra Modi, who has been in office since 2014. He holds the position of Chairman of the BJP-led NDA government. The previous prime minister is Narendra Modi, who held office from 2014 to 2019. He is the leader of the NDA government and the leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party in the Rajya Sabha.

The United States has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a gun for self-defense in the home.

The brief, filed by the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) and submitted Wednesday, rebuts a brief filed by the city of Chicago.

The case, District of Columbia v. Heller, centered on the constitutionality of the District of Columbia’s total ban on handguns.

In their brief, the NRA-ILA and Institute for Legislative Action argue that the Second Amendment protects “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use and possess firearms in common for self-defense within the home.”

“The right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited,” the brief reads. “It does not give individuals the right to sell or trade their firearms for drugs or to commit crimes. The Second Amendment","Narendra Modi

What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?,"The main functions that affect the exposure of an image are the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO.","If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.
1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.938475,0.982133,0.996149,0.20443,0.932426,0.810723,-2.285609483718872

My daughter is kind and thoughtful, and I didn’t even notice it.  She was right there with me, trying to understand the problem at hand.  I’ve never felt so proud.  I want to bottle up this feeling and keep it with me always.  It was so refreshing to feel like I wasn’t alone, that there are people in this world who want to help.

What steps can I take to avoid getting hit by a falling window from a skyscraper while walking about in downtown during high winds?,"While there is no way to guarantee 100% safety, there are some steps you can take to enhance your safety. First, make sure you are properly dressed for the weather. Wear sturdy shoes and a covering for your head (a helmet is not necessary if you are in an area where there is a helmet law). Second, avoid walking near glass windows along the side of tall buildings. These buildings can experience sudden gusts of wind that can cause the windows to break, sending shards of glass hurtling to the ground. Third, avoid walking near large crowds. A window that breaks in a crowded area could send shrapnel flying in all directions. And finally, if you do happen to get hit by a falling window, try to keep your head low and move to the side. This will reduce the chance that you will be struck by flying glass.","Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting hit by falling windows detached from tall building by strong winds from cyclones or tornadoes: 
1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. 
3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. 
4. You might think that being inside a car would be a safe option, but vehicles are notoriously dangerous places to be in during high winds because of their susceptibility to being blown over or blown away or for their windows to explode.",0.67649,0.999353,8.940967,0.937555,0.816584,2.47419,-3.1292028427124023

Describe the governing arrangements provided by the Articles of Confederation. What were the main weaknesses of the document?,"The Articles of Confederation was a proposed constitution for the new United States of America, which was being formed out of the former colonies. The Articles was the first constitution of the United States and was developed quickly.
The Articles of Confederation were a four part treaty which outlined the relationship between the 13 independent states and the mother country, Great Britain. The Articles were signed in 1777 and reflected the political realities of the time.

The Articles were a compact document which set out the relationship between the states and the central government. The states were the main parties to the Articles, and were expected to provide troops in an instant if another state was not meeting its financial obligations. The central government had very limited power, and could generate laws, but lacked the manpower to enforce them.

The weakest aspect of the Articles was the lack of a judiciary. The Articles of Confederation provided that all disputes between the states and the federal government would be settled by the untrained and unpaid delegates. Any parties to the dispute would have no remedy in the Articles and any award would be unenforceable.

The Articles were superseded by the Constitution of the United States when the new nation was formed. The Constitution was drafted and ratified in 1789 and established the framework for the United States of America for over two centuries.","The Articles of Confederation (AoC) was the first written constitution of the United States. There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions.

"Let’s solve the following math problem. Each rabbit has 4 feets and each duck has 2 feets. If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?","We can describe the 25 heads with an array of length 25 like this: [1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25].

Similarly, we can define an array of ducks with 2 feets like this: [32,27]. We can see that 27 is the feets of the duck at index 2.

Now, we can multiply the arrays: [25] * [2] = 100. Now, we can divide the ducks array by the size of ducks array: [2] / [2] = 1.

Finally, we can add the ducks array to the heads array: [25] + [27] = [32] + [25] = [57]. We can see that 25 + 27 = 57.","Let’s use equations to solve it! 
Let the number of ducks be X and the number of rabbits be Y.
We have X + Y = 25 and 2X + 4Y = 88.
Simplifying the first equation, we get Y = 25 - X
Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88
Which means 2X = 100 – 88 = 12, thus X = 6.
We substitute back into the first equation, we have Y = 25 - 6 = 19.

What is a quantum computer?,"A Quantum computer is a computer that uses the quantum mechanical properties of certain materials, such as atoms or ions, to perform computations.","A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.942512,0.995135,0.998285,0.130063,0.933954,0.79999,-2.6104328632354736

1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.

The FDA recommends statins for primary prevention in individuals without cardiovascular disease and in individuals with LDL cholesterol levels of 190 mg/dL or higher.  In addition to these benefits, statins are well tolerated and have a low rates of side effects.  

In Tomas's case, he reports having had a mild heart attack at age 45.

After this period of love, they tend to become disinterested in their partner and look for new love.","There are various reasons why humans fall in love: for example, because they see themselves in each other and thus find it easier to manage the relationship in terms of understanding and compatibility; some people feel attracted to those who have similar values to their own and thus the same way of feeling and acting. Still others are attracted to the physical part of the other person and think they are in love.",0.942755,0.998559,2.988983,0.931603,0.941572,1.360694,-3.343942642211914

Please describe what Business Process Mapping is and why it is used,"Business Process Mapping (BPM) is a structured and methodical approach to document and communicate how a business operates. Typically Business Process Mapping efforts are undertaken by the business’s internal customers and other relevant business stake holders to create a visual representation of processes, their inputs, outputs and interactions with other processes. 

BPM is a useful technique for a number of reasons but is particularly applicable to IT operations and ITIL service management teams. It allows IT operations and ITIL service management teams to share knowledge and best practice across their organisation, to reflect on their own practices and to understand other organisations processes. It also allows IT operations and ITIL service management teams to understand the interdependencies between their processes and to collaborate on process improvement efforts. 

Typically a BPM initiative is undertaken with the goal of producing a single BPM document that describes the full business process model from initiation to completion. The BPM document will typically be produced using the business process modelling notation that is specific to the organisation undertaking the BPM effort. 

Individual processes within the overall business process model will typically be documented in BPMN which is a process notation specific to business process modelling. Individual process activities will typically be documented in detail in BPMN but some process activities will typically be described in simple English. 

Processes will typically be grouped into Process Execution Cycle which is a series of related activities that occur in a defined order to produce a result. Each Process Execution Cycle will typically be documented in BPMN. 

Process Flow Charts will typically be used to visually depict the Process Execution Cycles and the flow of inputs, activities and outputs between the Process Execution Cycles. 

Process Automation Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) diagrams will typically be used to document how Business Processes are mapped to CDA entities. The CDA entities will typically be as follows: Parties, Documents, Properties/Attributes, Operations, and Annotations. 

Process Quality Management Control Process Mapping (QMC PM) diagrams are often used to document the implementation of Business Processes within a QMS (Quality Management System) such as ISO 9001:2008. The QMC PM diagrams will typically be BPMN process flow charts but will typically include additional nodes and text to describe the implementation of processes within a QMS.

Process Mining is also sometimes used to extract knowledge and understanding from the full business process model. This can be used to identify potential process improvement opportunities and to understand the dynamics of business processes.","Business Process Mapping describes the capture of a set of business activities that deliver an outcome.  Mapping is usually performed using visual tools that use standardized shapes to indicate entities.  Mapping involves capturing activities, the roles performing the activities, systems and tools used to execute the activities and inputs and outputs from the activities.  Process mapping is frequently conducted in cross functional workshops with a facilitator capturing the activities performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  Common uses of process mapping include:
* automation
* compliance documentation
* business process improvement
* standardization",0.376128,0.99903,17.967395,0.88187,0.608161,4.166517,-5.183370590209961

When was the Sydney Opera House formally opened,"The Sydney Opera House officially opened on 7 December 1973 by Queen Elizabeth II and was designed by Jorn Utzon. It was built by the New South Wales Government at a cost of A$26.7 million. It was built primarily as a performing arts centre for opera, ballet, symphony concerts, entertainment shows and conventions. The building was inspired by the waves of the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice and the form taken by sweet chestnuts from the tree. It is sometimes referred to as the Sydney Nut, as Utzon was inspired by the nut form of the sweet chestnut.","The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.

Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

how would you start explaining mathematics to kids?,"Kids are naturally curious by nature. So the first step to introducing them mathematics could be to observe them. Sometimes letting them watch you playing with numbers could be a good start. For example, you can ask them to help you count all the cars in the playground. After counting, you can ask them how many cars are more than 4 and less than 5? They should be able to tell you that there are more cars than 4 but fewer than 5. Then you can explain that when you have a question like this, you have to look at two numbers and see if they fit in the categories you mentioned.

What is the difference between solar power and hydrogen fuel cell?  What are the advantages of hydrogen?,"Solar power is the conversion of light energy into electrical energy.  The sun provides energy all day and night and can be captured and converted into electricity.  The advantage of solar power is it is sustainable, does not require fossil fuel to create, and produces little to no emissions.  Hydrogen, on the other hand, is a fuel and has to be created in a process called ""hydrogen manufacturing.""  Hydrogen is created from other sources of energy, such as solar and wind, and produces only water as an emission.  The advantage of hydrogen fuel cell is it is clean and efficient and produces no noise or exhaust.  Overall, solar power is a good choice because it is sustainable and produces no emissions.

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?,"A woodchuck's proverbial tail is certainly very short, but even so, a woodchuck could chuck quite a bit of wood. Typically, a woodchuck chucks no more than 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) of wood at a time, or about a foot (30.5 cm) of wood in 1 minute. This means that the chub would have to be chucking wood non-stop for more than 30 minutes just to attain its tail's length. And yet, the woodchuck is actually a non-confrontational animal, and would likely not defend itself against a predator if it thought its woodchuck-ness would be adversely perceived by potential mates. Instead of risking its life, the woodchuck chooses to chuck its wood in the safer environs of a forest, where it is unlikely to be seen by humans or perceived as a threat.","The answer to this depends on various factors.  If the wood if very heavy, a woodchuck may not be capable of chucking it at all.  If the pieces are smaller and the woodchuck was relatively young and spritely, then they could probably chuck at least 30 to 40lbs within a few hours.  An older woodchuck may no longer have dexterity in its hands or the sufficient strength needed to chuck any piece of wood regardless of its size or weight.",0.818102,0.999073,4.987637,0.848297,0.872157,1.705053,-3.4050815105438232

How would you go about finding an apartment in a new city?,"There are a couple of things you should think about when looking for an apartment.

Please summarize the timeline of the Chinese Exclusion Act.,"The passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 was a watershed event in U.S. history. It was the first legislation to restrict immigration based on race. It was the first of many laws passed over the next 30 years to restrict immigration. The Immigration Act of 1884 continued the ban on Chinese immigration but added more restrictions. These laws were passed due to a large labor shortage brought about by the decline of the American industrial revolution. By the end of the 19th century, there were restrictive immigration laws covering most nationalities and many states passed their own anti-Chinese legislation.","The Chinese Exclusion Act was signed on May 6, 1882. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902.

Explain how sampling bias in Voice Of Customer research could adversely affect a marketing analysis of customers' post-purchase experience with a product.,"Voice of Customer (VOC) research is a useful tool for marketers to understand their customers' views of their products and services, and to identify opportunities for improvement.  Marketing analysts often use this information to help them prioritise new product development and marketing initiatives. 

However, there is a risk that the information obtained from VOC surveys may not be representative of all customers.  This is because the customers who respond to the survey may be different to the average customer in some way, which could lead to an overestimation of the views of the average customer.  This could have a detrimental impact on marketers' ability to make sound decisions, as one or more customers may be experiencing an experience that is substantially different to the average.  This could be either good or bad for the product, but in either case it would be better to know about it in advance, before deciding on the marketing direction to take.","Recently I bought a TV from Amazon after extensive research and analysis. The TV manufacturer promptly followed up two weeks after the purchase. The post-purchase experience survey had questions like the following: 


·  	Did you buy it from a store/online?

·  	Which store did you visit? 

·  	Was the self-assembly instructions easy to follow? 

·  	What other items would you consider purchasing from our brand?

"How can a drought impact food supplies, and what effect does this change have?","A drought can have a number of impacts on food supplies.  First, it can affect the availability of water for agricultural purposes, which will impact the amount of land that can be used to grow crops.  If the amount of land available for growing crops is limited, this will impact how much food is available for human consumption.  Second, drought can impact the ability of farmers to grow crops, as they may no longer have enough water to irrigate their fields.  This can increase the cost of food, as farmers may need to purchase more water to maintain the crops they are growing.  Third, drought can impact the ability of farmers to reap the crops that they have grown, as they may not have the water necessary to be able to harvest the crops.  If the crops cannot be reaped, then they cannot be sold, which can increase the cost of food.  Fourth, drought can impact the ability of farmers to grow crops, as they may not have the labor available to plant, grow and harvest those crops.  If farmers do not have the labor available to grow crops, this can increase the cost of food.  Fifth, drought can impact the ability of farmers to produce crops, as they may not have the equipment available to plant, grow and harvest those crops.  If farmers do not have the equipment available to plant, grow and harvest those crops, this can increase the cost of food.  Finally, drought can impact the ability of food to be transported to market, as trucks and other means of transportation may not be able to navigate around areas with limited water supplies.  If food cannot be transported to market, this can increase the cost of food.  A combination of these impacts can lead to increased food costs.","A drought can reduce the amount of crops that can be grown due to less water being available for the farms in an area. In turn, fewer crops lead to smaller harvests, which can lead to issues supplying food to the area. These can lead to high food prices, or in severe cases, this can lead to famines.",0.746598,0.999333,13.970175,0.994548,0.834095,3.50895,-3.1557066440582275

- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn’t reflect investors’ true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors’ preference

Why some people are more stressed than others and how to manage stress?,"Stress can come from within us. Things like personal problems, financial worries, relationship issues, work pressures, etc. These can build up over time and can have a damaging impact on our mental and physical health.

Other sources of stress may be more external, such as a busy schedule, pressure from others, etc.

The way we react to stress is also important. We all have the capacity to respond constructively in the face of adversity. Effective stress management helps us to use this ability constructively. At a physiological level, we need to rest and relax so that our body can fully recover from the demands of the stressor. We also need to think clearly and make good decisions.

At a mental level, we need to find a sense of perspective, be able to manage our anxiety and focus on the positive side of things. Effective stress management can help us to establish a sense of resilience and the ability to bounce back quickly from setbacks.

Many of us do not have the ability to effectively manage our stress. We tend to use food, alcohol or drugs as a way to suppress negative feelings. This can often lead to poor health and a lack of well-being.

It is important to understand the sources of stress in our lives and to develop a plan for effective management. This will help to ensure that we are able to live healthier and happier lives.","Stress handling is a trait which comes naturally for some people, meaning they have it in their genetics. Some are born with this quality to manage hard and tricky situations with a cool behaviour, but for others it is tricky and they really need to train themselves to certain situations.When a person is stressed, it is always best they share their feelings with someone they trust.In a stressful situation, the natural response of our body is the release of Cortisol, which is the primary hormone which gets released and a good physical exercise routine can help in managing it.Prolonged stress leads to complicated issues such as Anxiety and  Depression which could be managed by practicing some relaxation techniques such as Yoga and Deep breathing.",0.686458,0.998667,14.17816,0.952459,0.753867,3.513922,-4.1821417808532715

The World Cup is the largest broadcast in the world, with over 400 channels around the world broadcasting the games.  The reason why soccer is so popular is because it is the only sport where a team can lose but still have a chance at winning.  A team can only score if another player on the team makes a mistake, and the game is so fast and skilled that it is almost impossible to predict when that will happen.  Also, a game can be tied at the end, so even if one team wins, both teams had a chance to score.  This makes soccer more interesting the other sports, where one team always has an advantage, like with basketball you can shoot from anywhere on the court and always have a chance to score.",Soccer is the most popular sport in the world because of several reasons including: It is easy to understand the rules and thus it is easy to play.  The scoring system is simple - one goal equals 1 point.  It does not require a lot of equipment.  As a soccer player you have a lot of freedom in decision making compared to other sports like American football where players are expected to follow specific directions and plays from the coach.

How can introverts maintain friendship.,"Introverts may not necessarily be quieter than extraverts, but they are in fact more likely to prefer spending time alone, think through their actions. They are more likely to be thoughtful, reserved, shy, and a bit anxious. Introverts often don't speak up in a group until they have talked through the details with a close friend. They need time to process the information, and make sure they understand the other person's perspective.

In a group, they will often prefer to listen than talk. They prefer to write things down so they can think through their meaning, rather than talking them through. They often feel more comfortable in the background. 

While introverts make great friends, they need someone who understands them and their needs. Friends who are introverts, need to remember that they need time to process and reflect, before deciding on how to act or what to say. Friends who are extraverts, need to be more cautious before jumping into a conversation without thinking. They need to consider if their friend truly understands them, or if they're just being talked at.","Introverts like to be themselves. They dont like being forced to things why dont like to do. This is extremely difficult for them. They respect their friends space and expect the same in return. Introverts need to find friends who respect them for what they are and dont push them to do things they dont like and have said no to once.

It is also one of the largest employers of native Hawaiians, with many residents choosing to work in the industry after moving to the state. Tourism has had a significant impact on Hawaii's culture, influencing its music, food, and many cultural practices, particularly in rural areas.

What is Targetted Allele-Specific CRISPR/Cas9 Activation (TASCA)?,"TASCA is a recently developed genome-editing technology which allows the precise modification of DNA at selected genomic loci using only a sgRNA (single guide RNA) and Cas9 nuclease. The use of only a single guide RNA significantly reduces off-target effects compared to other genome-editing technologies such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs).

The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a prokaryotic immune system which uses a short guiding RNA to detect and destroy foreign DNA elements. The RNA directs the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific site in the genome and the nuclease recognizes the ""protospacer"" sequence on the foreign DNA and cuts the DNA at that site.

In TASCA, a short ""activation"" guide RNA is used which contains a sequence complementary to a sequence in the targeted DNA locus. When the two guide RNAs are expressed in the cell (usually as a chimeric transcript), the guide RNA that matches the activation sequence will give it priority to bind to the target DNA and the ""activation"" guide RNA will be able to bind to the ""normal"" guide RNA that would activate the Cas9 nuclease.

This gives the possibility to activate only the target locus and not affect other genomic loci which contain the ""normal"" guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease.

The activation guide RNA can be designed to promote the expression of a gene of interest (that is normally silenced) or to inactivate a gene of interest, or to activate a cell's own DNA at a specific locus.

There are no ethical concerns in terms of using the TASCA technology, as the activation guide RNA is designed using publicly available algorithms and does not contain a Cas9 nuclease recognition sequence, so it does not induce Cas9 nuclease activity.

Give me some examples of Cockney Rhyming Slang and help me understand how it works.,"Cockney Rhyming Slang is a form of street slang from London that uses euphemisms and puns to substitute for swear words. The following examples are used to explain how it works:

- ""I'm off the booze"" could be read as ""I'm off the beer.""
- ""I've got a thumping head"" could be read as ""I've got a pounding head.""
- ""I've been into the curry shop"" could be read as ""I've been into the curry.""","Cockney rhyming slang is a slang language originating from the East End in London, United Kingdom. It has a simple structure where a rhyming word or phrase is used in substitution of the word's true meaning. Examples:

"Share why you support the underdog or the favorite in sports, and why it's the right thing to do.","I support the underdog in sports because it can often be the case that more deserving teams don't always win. When a team is underdog, there is an opportunity for that team to surprise people and win. The reason that a team is often considered underdog is because it's not yet fully formed. It needs the support of the community, and it does not yet have the tools necessary to win. When the community supports the underdog, it reminds the team that it needs to keep working hard, keep growing, and keep learning. The community becomes a team, too, and that team works together to help the underdog team to win. Win or lose, when the community comes together, it is beautiful.",Support the underdog because they are striving to exceed expectations.   Support the favorite because they have earned the right based on prior performance.   To support the underdog is the best path to take.   Rooting for a team/individual to outperform expectations and to be a better competitor is what we all strive to be.  Supporting the underdog makes for better competition.  Supporting the underdog lets you help push for over performance through genuine support.   Supporting the underdog enables you to be part of a new celebration versus simply checking another box.

Can I make chocolate at home?,"Yes, you can make chocolate at home. In order to make chocolate at home, you will need the following items:
- Cocoa beans (chocolate seeds)
- Water
- Sugar
- A powerful oven
- A candy thermometer
- A metal bowl
- A metal whisk
- A mixing bowl
- A candy thermostat
- A rubber spatula

First, you will need to roast the cocoa beans. Roasting the cocoa beans will give the chocolate its depth of flavor. Next, you will need to grind the roasted cocoa beans into a fine powder. The fine powder will be your source of chocolate.

Next, you will need to calculate the amount of chocolate you want to make. To do this, you will need to use your candy thermometer to measure the temperature of sugar syrup. To do this, you will need to combine water and sugar in a saucepan. Next, you will need to heat the mixture to a rolling boil. Next, you will need to lower the heat to a simmer. Next, you will need to place your candy thermometer into the saucepan. You will need to stir the mixture until it reaches a specific temperature. This temperature will be the amount of sugar syrup you will need to add to the ground roasted cocoa beans. You will need to stir this mixture until it reaches a specific temperature. This temperature will be the right amount of chocolate for your recipe.

After you have calculated the correct amount of chocolate, you will need to measure out the correct amount of the ground cocoa beans. Next, you will need to place the chocolate into a metal bowl. You will need to place the metal bowl over a pot of simmering water. You will need to stir this mixture until it reaches a specific temperature. This temperature will be the right amount of temperature for your chocolate.

After you have reached the correct temperature, you will need to place the metal bowl into your metal whisk. You will need to place the metal whisk in the bowl of chocolate. You will need to heat the chocolate until it reaches a specific temperature. This temperature will be the right amount of temperature for your chocolate.

After you have reached the correct temperature, you will need to place the metal bowl into the oven. You will need to heat the chocolate until it reaches a specific temperature. This temperature will be the right amount of temperature for your chocolate.

After the chocolate reaches the correct temperature, you will need to place the metal bowl into the mixing bowl. You will","Making chocolate at home can be rewarding, but be prepared to spend a little money and a lot of time. The money goes to equipment and cocoa beans.

Buy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.

Sort the beans, removing broken beans, badly misshapen beans, and whatever foreign bodies may be present.

Roast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!

What characterizes turbulent flow,"Turbulent flow is characterized by dramatic changes in a fluid's properties. Turbulence occurs when there are chaotic changes in flow due to interactions between fluid particles. These chaotic changes cause pressure and velocity fluctuations in the fluid that are relatively large compared with the mean values for these variables. Turbulence can be found in a wide range of natural phenomena, such as the flow of air through a jet engine, the movement of water through a riverbed, or the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Turbulence is also found in many engineering systems, including heat exchangers, turbochargers, and liquid rocket engines. Turbulence can negatively affect the performance of many systems, such as those in aircraft and heat exchangers. In liquid rocket engines, turbulence can hinder performance because it reduces the amount of thrust that the engine can produce.",Turbulent flow is characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity.,0.850445,0.997359,6.980225,0.920246,0.864057,2.122467,-3.449629068374634

In the universe I know
We are not Here
We have missed each other
This is why Here, we feel out of sync

Shared that same conviction 
But it’s only a soft hint Here
Like a deja vu 

Is it time or space? 
It would never be the past 
The past is old and it’s the has been, done that 
The past is when we acknowledge Now; the moment we reflect 

The moment we realize that again time has failed us 
With its seeds of doubt
And badge of wisdom...
that necessary caution built brick by brick

In the universe I know, we have made it Here
To our moment
To the moment I’ve been waiting for

And then I realize abruptly I’m here alone

In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994. About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman and the FSF started by creating utilities for the operating system first. These utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to create a complete system called GNU/Linux, or, less precisely, just Linux.",0.942625,0.982282,2.933997,0.09257,0.939897,1.178274,-3.5582122802734375

From a logical perspective, god would have to be all powerful.  This would mean that god would be able to do anything.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be all knowing.  This would mean that god would be able to see everything that happens in the universe, and everything that will happen in the future.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be just.  This is difficult to understand, but it is important to logical thinking.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be perfect.  This would mean that god would have to be without sin.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be perfectly good.  This would mean that god would have to be entirely good.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be the source of all that is good.  This would mean that god would have to be perfect, and without sin.  From a logical perspective, god would have to be a being of absolute perfection, and without sin.

Therefore, god is either active and benevolent, active and indifferent, passive and benevolent, or passive and indifferent.

What is the history of coffee?,Coffee has been consumed for hundreds of years but it was in the 18th century that it begins to spread across Europe and the United States. Its consumption increased even more in the 19th century after coffeehouses opened across Europe and the United States. These coffeehouses offered social gatherings where people could meet and read newspapers. This social aspect of coffeehouses allowed it to spread quickly. Coffeehouses existed in Mecca and Medina in the 7th century and it spread throughout the Muslim world. The rapid spread of coffee had to do with the expansion of the slave trade which spread coffee plants to the Americas. A third of the world population was consuming coffee by 1850. By 1900 the consumption of coffee had decreased by half around the world.,"Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. Today, coffee is a household item as a result of modern production techniques",0.709963,0.998945,7.916279,0.840321,0.772576,2.247617,-3.5059103965759277

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?","Consistency is very important when it comes to the perception of public opinion.  People tend to be consistent within issues.  For example, if a person is asked about gun control, they will likely have the same opinion on that issue whether they are asked about banning rifles or handguns.  In addition, they will be consistent across different levels of conceptualization.  When asked about banning handguns or rifles, they will likely have the same opinion.  When asked about banning rifles or handguns, they will likely have the same opinion.  This is because people’s opinions are often driven by the context in which an issue is asked.  E.g., it may be the case that there is more support for banning handguns than rifles.  This should be taken into account when asking people about their public opinion on an issue.","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.  Fourth are “nature of the times”, when evaluations of candidates and parties are tied to general perceptions about",0.00959,0.999532,8.087553,0.940462,0.01217,2.009861,-3.935453176498413

What is the greenhouse effect?,"The greenhouse effect is the natural process by which the Earth's atmosphere helps to regulate the temperature of the planet. Warm air in the atmosphere naturally rises, while cold air tends to fall. This natural process is called convection, and it is what causes the movements of air that we experience every day.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that plays a critical role in regulating the temperature of the planet. In actuality, the greenhouse effect helps regulate the temperature of the planet far above what is needed for human or animal survival.

The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane absorb and emit thermal radiation, or light. This process helps to keep the planet at a relatively steady temperature, while allowing the planet to naturally regulate itself.

The buildup of these gases in the atmosphere has led to the well-known effect of global warming.",The greenhouse effect is the process by which the sun's energy gets trapped in a planet's atmosphere and heat's the planet's surface.

1. Give them a harsh punishment. This may work if the kid's age is below ten.

3. Trust them. Only then you can guide them and teach them what is right and wrong.","Well, there is no 1 exact rule that applies to all, there are many things which impact how a kid behaves.

Usually, we put restrictions on screen time for kids, but remember even we are answerable to them when we spend too much time on gadgets than with people around us. We expect kids to respect us, so the same holds good for us, try to behave with them the way you to see them behave with you. Try to dedicate a few hours to spend time with them, remember it's the quality and not the quantity that matters here.

What's the best way to learn something?,"The best way to learn something is to teach it to yourself.  Read as much as you can about the subject you want to learn.

Read as much as possible and create an outline on the topic. Leverage the five Ws technique of problem solving - Who, What, When, Where and Why.

There are numerous ways to get familiarized with concepts. One way to do it would be to jot down your notes, try to make connections and try to simplify the ideas if possible. Assume that you are trying to explain this to a five year old, how would you build the topic, make it interesting either by visualizations, metaphors etc.? 

Another beneficial technique that can be of good help here, would be to put the concept into application in some form or the other. This can be done by either practicing the concepts in real life if feasible, or by observing its presence and relevance.

Who was Alexander the Great?,"Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander the Great, was a Greek king of the Aramean/Macedonian kingdom of Anatolia and the eastern part of Greece. A member of the Argead dynasty, he founded the Hellenistic world's third empire, which covered most of the Mediterranean and the western part of Asia Minor. He was born into the House of Arrhidaeus and raised in Ptolemais, Egypt. His mother was Barsine, a Bactrian Greek princess. He studied under the philosopher Aristotle in Athens, and subsequently led his army to expand the Persian Empire, succeeding his father Philip II. He conquered the Persian provinces of Bactria, Sogdiana, then moved westward to Egypt. There, he defeated his rival Ptolemy XIII and restored his father to the throne.

In 302 BC, at the age of 25, Alexander succeeded his father on the Greek throne. Within a decade, he had conquered the Persian Empire, including Egypt, Persis, Bactria, Sogdiana, Pathria, and Gandhara. He advanced into India and crossed the Indus River to the historical kingdom of Prakrti. In his quest for the ""end of the earth"", he marched through modern-day Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan, through modern-day Iran, Iraq, Syria, Cyprus, Egypt, Nubia, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Arabian Peninsula to the Indus River. He founded Alexandria Eschate (today's Ai-teppeu) to control the Persian Gulf and the caravan routes of Central Asia. He also established Greek colonies along the Nile and founded the city of Alexandria, the capital of Egypt. He returned to Greece in 300 BC and became the king of multiple kingdoms of the Ancient Greek world. He died unexpectedly of a fever in Babylon after one of the greatest conquests in human history while in his early 30s.

Although he is mostly remembered for his conquests, he is also known for his philanthropy, political and cultural achievements, and the quality of his writing. He is the subject of many Ancient Greek and Roman texts, including the Greek historian Plutarch's Lives and Moralia and the Latin Alexander Romance. He is regarded as an inspiration by many historical figures, including the rulers of Alexander's Successor States, the Roman Empire, and the Christian Church. His legacy has been compared","Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon. He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

Why should people convert lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants?,"Native plants are better at soaking up water than non-native lawn grasses and ornamental plants. In addition, native plants provide better habitat for wildlife, and are less visually disruptive to people.","Who doesn’t love butterflies? They are a beautiful symbol of innocence. But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?

One of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.

The other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars.

What is the difference between AWD and 4WD?,"In addition to utilizing 4WD when appropriate, AWD allows the vehicle to distribute torque to all of its drive wheels instead of only the wheels in high- traction situations. When AWD is not needed, 4WD can help distribute torque to the road the vehicle best supports drive.","AWD is a system that without driver intervention, shifts power between the rear and front wheels. This system is typically found on light-duty SUVs or passenger cars. The AWD drive system is designed for mild inclement weather conditions such as light snow, ice and rain. It is not designed for off-roading or severe weather conditions such as heavy snow or mud. This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. 

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease.

What is the gun culture in the United States?,"The United States has a long history of gun ownership. Starting in the 1600s, British traders brought firearms to the New World and the colonists began to manufacture their own weapons. The second amendment to the U.S. Constitution established a right to bear arms. The frontier meant that guns were essential for survival, and by the late 1800s, most Americans owned a firearm. In the years following the Civil War, firearms manufacturers marketed their products to all socioeconomic classes. Amidst political unrest, the NRA became a powerful lobbying group in the 1900s, and today, the United States has the most guns of any country in the world.","The United States has become a victim of its past as it relates to its gun culture. The 2nd Amendment was ratified in 1791, which at the time seemed appropriate given that the United States had just waged a war against England for its freedom. However, more than 200 years later, the 2nd Amendment no longer solely ties itself to its original intent: to protect itself and its people. The prevalence of guns in the United States has led to the United States having the highest gun ownership rates in the world.

How do I learn how to code?,"If you want to learn how to code, there are several resources you can use. 

Online tutorials: There are many online resources that can help you learn how to code. Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy are some of the most popular courses that can help you learn the basics of coding.
Learning a framework: Once you understand the basics of coding, it is helpful to understand how to apply these skills to specific problems using a framework. Flask, Django, and Laravel are some of the most popular frameworks used by developers. Through these frameworks, you can apply your knowledge of fundamentals to build specific applications.","Starting to code can be easy and fun. A common path is to enroll into a higher education institution which often have rigorous curricula which will equip you with the fundamentals. 

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.

Who is the greatest musical theatre composer of all time?,"While there are many factors to consider when determining the greatest musical theatre composer of all time, one of the most important is the number of shows that they have composed for.  ""Music and Lyrics"" for the long running Broadway show, ""Wicked,"" for which he earned a Tony Award, and ""A Christmas Story"" for screen and Broadway, is probably the most work that a composer has done in a single career.  All time is a very long time though, so if the composer is still active, the number of shows they have been involved in composing for might still have a chance of being greater.  While no one can say for sure how many shows they will end up writing for, the number of shows that ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" for which he wrote the music and lyrics as well as the book, the Tony Award winning ""The Apple Tree,"" and ""Hair"" for which he also wrote the book, are, are all safe bets for him staying active for a very long time.  If he is still writing for shows in 2050, then that would put his active lifetime at over 100 shows, which would make him the greatest musical theatre composer of all time.","While art is subjective, there are a few luminary composers who have made significant contributions to musical theatre and whose work has stood the test of time. One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having ""hummable"" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with ""Send in",0.205689,0.99957,4.481026,0.905744,0.328118,1.384029,-4.094738006591797
What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,A good hitter is a cool-headed hitter. They should be able to stay balanced in the batters box and have good focus on the pitcher they are hitting against. A good hitter is also able to read the pitchers ball flight. Good batters are able to recognize balls that are out of the fielders reach and are able to adjust their hitting pattern to compensate for the ball.,"There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion.

Substituting in a from the left side of the equation and rearranging yields MV=ma, which is equivalent to Newton's second law of motion.","Bernoulli's principle can be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second Law of Motion. If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.",0.506459,0.997266,2.9074,0.952926,0.535949,1.18,-4.1835761070251465

Why Rafael Nadal succeeds on clay?,Rafael Nadal is considered as the best clay court player in the world. He has won 14 singles titles on clay courts and has won the Rome Masters seven times. He has a record of 76-4 on clay which is the best winning record in the history of clay court tennis.,"Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

Please summarize the main argument of this paragraph from Woodrow Wilson's speech to Congress asking them to declare war on Germany.,"The main argument of this paragraph is that the United States should join World War I because it would be good for the world and to protect its own national security interests. First, the United States should join World War I because it would be good for the world. The war would end the threat of German militarism and expansion that had provoked World War I in the first place. It would also help America protect its national security interests. If the United States entered the war, Britain, which was fighting on the side of the Allies, would need to coordinate with America's wartime efforts to combat German submarine attacks on merchant ships. This would give the United States a unique opportunity to coordinate military efforts and improve American national security. Secondly, the United States should join World War I because it would be good for America. If the United States entered the war, there was a good chance that America would win, greatly improving its national security. This would be a great boon to the United States, giving it security and prosperity.","Wilson thought neutrality was impractical, and would actually lead into America more likely being attacked by Germany because what they were doing threatened all of Western civilization.

History of the Arches National Park creation.,"In 1929, President Herbert Hoover established the Arches National Monument to protect the sandstone arches and spires created by the Garfield and Brushy Mountains.  The name Arches was adopted in 1933.  The monument was the first of the National Monuments established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, and was the first National Monument to be dedicated on April 22, 1933.

In 1972, President Richard Nixon abolished the National Monuments and National Parks, and the name was changed to Arches National Park. The new name was adopted in 2008 in honor of President George W. Bush, who provided $25 million in funding for improvements at the park.

In 1975, Congress passed the National Park Service Organic Act, which established the National Park Service as an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior. Arches National Park became the nation's 93rd National Park on August 25, 1980.","First Humans appeared in this region during the last ice age 10000 years ago. The first settlers began in 1775 but were abandoned before 1855 when ranchers, farmers, and prospectors settled in Moab(the closest city to the Arches). The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created.

What is salvation in christianity?,"Salvation is the state of being saved from eternal punishment in hell or being saved from physical death and brought into an eternal relationship with God in heaven. Salvation is the first step on the pathway to eternal life.

In Christianity, salvation is the free gift of God that he grants to all people without regard to their works or efforts, but is not an earned gift. Salvation is a gift because it was given by God, not because someone deserved it. The Bible refers to this gift of salvation as ""grace"" because it is an unearned gift.

In the biblical world, to be ""saved"" was to be declared ""cleared"" (Hebrew: tizkor, from a verb that also means ""to clear"" or ""to make clean""; cf. LXX; Arabic Tadbir; Aramaic Tzkr, Gr., Griske/GraecizeΤζαβir, Grk.: ἔλεγχος, Gr.: ήλεγχος, Gk.: εὐλήθεια). It was to be declared ""not guilty"" of one's sins. The concept of being ""cleared"" was understood as being ""purified"" of sin, and was an integral part of the sacrificial system.

In Catholicism, salvation is a gift of grace from God that overcomes the free will of human beings and brings them into communion with God and one another. This gift of grace is received by the faithful through the miracle of faith called ""conversion"".

In most branches of Protestantism, salvation is the free gift of God that is received through faith in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, who died on the cross to pay the penalty for sin and to satisfy God's wrath against sin. Salvation is based on the person's personal belief in Jesus Christ, which is called ""repentance"".

For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days. The odds are measured as the number of events divided by the number of non-events.

How do you play basketball,Basketball is played in a court by two teams of five players each with four players on the court at the same time. The offensive team attempts to throw a ball through a hoop on the other teams net at the other teams end of the court. The objective of the offensive team is to score more points than the other teams by shooting the ball through the net from as close to the hoop as possible. The other teams objective is to prevent the offensive team from doing this by blocking their shots.,"Basketball is a game played on a court with five players on each team. There are two baskets that are 10 feet tall on each end of the court and the goal of the game is to get the ball into the basket at the opposing end of the court. Each basket is worth two points, unless the ball is shot from outside of an arc that is painted on the floor. If the shot it made outside of the arc, then it's worth three points. The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul.

What is the history of Tax Day in the United States?,"The phrase ""tax day"" is most often associated with April 15th, the day when taxes must be filed for individual or business entities in the United States.  The day was first created by union activists and was the result of Congress increasing taxes on corporate America in 1894.  That tax increase was very unpopular with corporations and the business community and they used the slogan ""make tax day"" to pressure congress into reducing the taxes.  In 1934 President Roosevelt pushed for a national holiday for filing taxes, and in 1974 the Tax Foundation named April 15th as National Tax Day.","Tax Day exists as a deadline for many United States residents to report earnings in order to pay income taxes.

The United States introduced the income tax in 1861 in order to fund the American Civil War. This was later deemed unconstitutional and repealed in 1872.

What is the best food?,"There is no simple answer to this. Every culture has a food that is considered the best. For example, the food in France is considered the best.

While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza.

Exponential smoothing: This method assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, with more recent observations being given more weight. This method can be effective for time series with trend and/or seasonality.

It’s recommend to eat a balanced and healthy diet. This generally consists of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seeds, nuts and foods that contain proteins, such as beans, peas, meat or fish. Healthy foods usually contain relatively low amounts of sugar, salt and trans fats. 

Moreover, it’s important to exercise. This could be achieved by doing sports, but basically every form of exercise helps, for instance by walking or gardening.

What are the applications of game theory in NBA basketball?,"Game theory has been used in NBA basketball to analyze strategies employed by players, coaches, and teams. For example, the book The Art of Winning in the NBA uses game theory to explain how teams can maximize their performance by analyzing the strategies of opposing teams and coaches.","Game theory studies the strategic interaction of rationale agents. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy.

Who are the greatest soccer players of all time?,"This is a very subjective topic, and there is no definitive answer.  Some of the best players are from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and Spain.  Its hard to compare players across different decades, as the rules, tactics, and levels of competition are all different.  For example, Pele played in the 1950s and 1960s, which had a much lower quality of play than the 1970s and 1980s.  Other factors that could affect the rankings are World Cup performance, individual awards, and popularity with the fans.

In 1999 he was voted European Player of the Century and came second behind Pelé as world player of the Century.

"Netflix views streaming video as a ""sustaining"" technology that extends its core mail DVD business. Do you agree with this, or do you think streaming video is a ""disruptive"" technology for Netflix that does not align with its core business and requires a different strategy?","I think streaming video is a sustaining technology for Netflix because it allows the company to extend its core business of producing and distributing DVDs. Netflix does not need to worry about the hardware and software to stream video, because it is already doing this. It also means that the content that Netflix produces does not need to be limited to DVDs that can be stored in a DVD player. Netflix can also produce video content for streaming that can be viewed on any device with an Internet connection. Therefore, the streaming video technology is highly complementary to the DVDs business.

However, I do agree that the streaming video business is different from the DVDs business. For DVDs, Netflix could predict that people would continue to want to own physical DVDs and that the market for streaming video would be limited. However, with streaming video, there is no ""middleman"" to charge extra for: Netflix is the middleman, and it is providing the streaming video service. Therefore, Netflix needs to worry about keeping streaming video services free or close to free, because there is no ""cost"" to the middleman. The middleman fees are for DVDs, where there is a middleman. Therefore, Netflix should rethink its strategy for streaming video and think more like a traditional company, in which the streaming video service is a loss-leader to attract customers to the DVDs business.","Netflix did a strategic renewal by cannibalizing its own cash cow business of mail-in-DVD services. This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform. Netflix made Blockbuster dance to its tunes. Netflix, currently valued at $150 billion, changed its business model twice by cannibalizing its core services, shifting from mail-in- DVD service to subscription service to streaming video subscription service.

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye,"Nuclear fission is a process by which the nucleus of an atomic nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing energy in the process. The nucleus of a uranium atom is very unstable, and is susceptible to fission when bombarded with a particle or particle beam, such as X-rays. The process is also possible by allowing a neutron to strike a fissile atom. The process is endothermic, which means it takes in energy to perform.","Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.92683,0.99645,3.977173,0.786366,0.922483,1.52186,-3.5339314937591553

This allows for more surface area to paddle on compared to a kayak.  They are both extremely efficient ways to move across the water and are great for all levels of paddlers.,"Stand up paddle boards and kayaks are both non-motorized water crafts. Typically a kayak is either sit on top or sit in water craft, the user paddles through the water from a seated position. Most kayaks are made from polyethylene but some kayaks are made from kevlar or fiberglass, there are also inflatable kayaks.  A stand up paddle board typically allows the user to paddle while standing up but they can also paddle while sitting if desired.

"Can you write a brief summary for the book ""Braving the Wilderness"" by Brene Brown?","Brene Brown is a researcher and consultant who studies ""The Power of vulnerability"". She identifies courage, authenticity, belonging, and risk-taking as the foundational qualities necessary for success. Brown emphasizes the need to be kind to ourselves in order to be kind to others. She states that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather it is a courageous act that allows the human spirit to soar. Brown believes that authenticity is the key to unlocking our hidden strengths and that belonging is essential to our well-being. She stresses the importance of being honest with others and ourselves about who we are, what we like, and what we want and shares numerous examples of how others have transformed through vulnerability. Finally, Brown identifies risk-taking as a courageous act that is necessary to our growth and reminds us that mistakes are part of the process of learning.","Braving the Wilderness is a book about belonging, identity, and leadership. A core idea is that if you are courageous enough to stand alone in the name of the virtues and values you believe in, you can actually create more belonging for others.

Is it acceptable to sign a cappella (without musical accompaniment) at a community musical theater audition?,"While it is not common, it is not unheard of to sign a cappella. If you are a trained singer, and there is a part for you, it is recommended that you sing a cappella (without musical accompaniment) to ensure that you stick to the key and range of the song. The audience will often judge the singer's range by how well they can sing without music. A cappella singing is not uncommon in the Broadway musical scene, and in community musical theater auditions, as a singer's range is often defined early on in the audition. However, if you are singing a jazz or swing song, it is recommended that you sing with music.","No, this is usually not considered acceptable. Auditioners for local, community musical theater are usually expected to provide sheet music -- clearly marked with their specific cut of the material -- for the audition accompanist.

In some cases, the company holding the auditions may also allow you to play recorded accompaniment at the audition.
