The initial state is the empty string, and the target state is \"the empty string\".

Like most people, they\u2019re afraid to change their lifestyle, even if it\u2019s right in front of them. But the benefits of minimalism don\u2019t have to be confined to the bedroom or a house. It can be applied to your home as well.\n\nPractical and Convenient\n\nMinimalism is practical. Rather than owning a house, condo, or apartment, you can live in a home with fewer things. While you may have to sacrifice a few comforts, you\u2019ll still have the most practical and convenient home possible. You\u2019ll be able to live more comfortably and more efficiently.\n\nHealthier\n\nYou\u2019ll have more space to move around in. You\u2019ll also have more space to breathe. The clean lines of a minimalist interior will give your home a more modern appearance and feel.\n\nAlso, you\u2019ll have less stress.

The IP is determined by the following relations: IP = IP(CO(2)) + IP(SF(6)) + IP(SF(6)/CO(2)) + IP(CO(2)/SF(6)) + IP(SF(6)/CO(2)/SF(6)) + IP(CO(2)/SF(6)/CO(2)) and IP = IP(SF(6)/CO(2)) + IP(SF(6)/CO(2)/SF(6)). We show that for some organic compounds, IP(CO(2))/IP(SF(6)) values are appreciably larger than IP(SF(6)/CO(2)). The effect of CO(2) on IP in mixtures is primarily due to the larger IP(CO(2))/IP(SF(6)) value of the mixture. For other compounds, IP(CO(2)/SF(6)) values are appreciably larger than IP(SF(6)/CO(2)). The effects of CO(2) and SF(6) on IP in mixtures are not fully understood.

The program, which was instituted by the Bloomberg administration in 2004 and since expanded by the NYPD, offers the purchase of rifles and shotguns for a nominal fee.\n\nThe New York City program is currently being administered by the New York City Police Department. The program was established to assist in the distribution of handguns and rifles to New York City school children and was expanded to include the purchase of shotguns.\n\nThe recall campaign is the first step in an ongoing effort to reduce the availability of assault weapons in America. While the New York City program was created to help protect New York City students, it is also being used to promote the second amendment rights of all New York City residents.\n\nThe New York City Police Department is urging all New York City taxpayers to call the NYC Public Schools to report the names, addresses and school of any teacher participating in the program. The NYC Public Schools, at its direction, has issued a recall letter to each of the participating teachers.\n\nThe NYC Police Department is also urging New York City residents to call their local Board of Education to report any teacher who is participating in the program.\n\nThe New York City Police Department will also be monitoring the program to ensure that no teachers are illegally purchasing guns for their students. If you have any questions or concerns about the recall effort, please contact the NYC Police Department at (212) 207-6200.\n\nThe Recall email below is being sent to all New York City Public School teachers who are enrolled in the New York City program.

The project was three years in the planning and three years in the execution, involving 200 partners from the public and private sectors as well as academics and entrepreneurs. The main focus was on the development of new concepts in health care, focusing on the needs of the European population as well as on the need for a more efficient health care delivery system. The project was conceived from the very first stages as a project in form of a business case, in which a model for innovation was defined by the project participants. The project has shown that innovation is not a concept that can be defined by the likes of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn, who in his 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions argued that science is a dynamic process of continuous change. The project has shown that innovations are a process of continuous change that is not static, but dynamic and therefore requires constant attention and continuous adaptation to the changing needs of the population. The project has shown that in the case of innovation concepts that are always conceived as static, rather than dynamic, should be avoided. The project has shown that it is not possible to find a specific model of innovative processes, but that the concept of innovation can be defined by a model that is consistent with the needs of the population. The project has shown that it is more important to find new concepts than to design new processes in health care.

Field of the invention\nThe present invention relates to an inverter apparatus for driving a motor, and more particularly to an inverter apparatus which has improved voltage conversion efficiency from an input DC power source to an output DC power source.\n2. Description of the Background Art\nConventionally, a DC/DC inverter apparatus is known to be driven by a motor (see U.S. Pat. No. 4,591,795).\nIn the conventional DC/DC inverter apparatus, a DC/DC converter is used as the DC/DC converter. The DC/DC converter has a configuration including a switching element for switching a direct current (DC) power source according to a switching operation, and a rectifying/smoothing circuit for rectifying and smoothing an output voltage of the switching element and outputting the rectified and smoothed DC voltage.\nIn the DC/DC inverter apparatus, the rectifying/smoothing circuit is a passive circuit which receives a DC power source. As a result, the DC/DC inverter apparatus has a configuration in which a DC voltage of the DC power source which is input to the rectifying/smoothing circuit is converted into an AC voltage by the rectifying/smoothing circuit and is outputted to the motor.\nIn order to achieve a high speed operation of the motor, the DC/DC inverter apparatus having the above-described configuration has a configuration in which a switching element of a power transistor is provided to the rectifying/smoothing circuit.\nHowever, in the AC/DC converter in which a rectifying circuit is provided in series to a DC power source, the DC voltage is leaked into a ground side of the rectifying circuit, so that the DC voltage of the DC power source becomes a high-potential DC voltage in some cases.\nA DC/DC inverter is configured so that the rectifying/smoothing circuit is a passive circuit which receives a DC power source.\nIn the DC/DC inverter of the above configuration, the DC voltage is supplied to the rectifying/smoothing circuit and thus, the DC voltage is converted into an AC voltage by the rectifying/smoothing circuit", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

He had a clinical presentation mimicking MS and MRI findings of MS. He was treated with combination therapy of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate. He had a complete remission of his disease. He remained relapse free for three years. No relapse was observed during the two years following the withdrawal of the therapy. This case shows that anti-aquaporin 4 antibody should be considered in the diagnosis of RRMS. There is a need for further studies to clarify the role of anti-aquaporin 4 antibody in the pathogenesis of MS.The Non-Profit Sector\n\nThe Non-Profit Sector\n\nNon-profit organizations (NPOs) are governed by local laws.

The locations may be more than 60 different locations spread all over the world.\n\nIn that case, each of these locations will have a travel time to it. Now to decide how to connect these locations will be a very difficult task, but since the map is going to be a long list of locations, some of the distances will be very short \u2013 in the order of 5 minutes.\n\nFor example, if the flight takes 15 minutes to arrive at the London airport it will be a very short distance and therefore the travel time to the London airport will be a short travel time to the airport.\n\nIn this way the map will be a map that has many small maps, which are all connected to each other and all connected by travel times.\n\nWhat is interesting is that the map will be created on the fly, as a result of the travel times that are determined by the travel to the nearest small map.\n\nThe airline will have to determine, for each location, how long it takes to get there. Each location could have a different travel time.\n\nFor example, if the flight leaves from the London airport at 8 AM, it will take 15 minutes to get to the airport. This will mean the travel time to the London airport (which is found at the top of the map) is 15 minutes.\n\nIf the flight leaves from the Los Angeles airport at 11 AM it will take 35 minutes to get to the airport. This will mean the travel time to the Los Angeles airport (which is found at the bottom of the map) is 35 minutes.\n\nTogether these two examples make it clear that the plane travel times will be determined by the travel time to the nearest small map.\n\nThe only problem with this approach is the sheer number of small maps that will need to be generated and that will need to be connected by travel times.\n\nThe airline will", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

There is NO\nwarranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\nA:\n\nThere are a few good uses of compiled languages which are not JIT-compiled.  Here are some examples.\n\nIf you have a large number of variables in a program, you can compile it to a module.  The module contains many functions, and each function is in a separate file.  Then, you can use the module as a library to access the functions.  This is handy for things like game servers or 3D engines or garbage collection for a program.  \nIf you want to run your program only on Linux, you can compile it to a module which can be used as a script to start the program.  The script doesn't need to be written in the language of the compiled program.  This is handy for things like scripting languages like Python or Perl.  \nIf you want to run your program on Windows, you can compile it to a module which contains the functions that you want to use.  You can use the functions to call the program and execute it.  \nIf you want to share your programs, you can compile it to a library.  You can then share libraries between multiple programs.  For example, if I have a C++ program, I can compile it to a library and use the libraries in other programs.  Then, I can use the libraries in other programs in order to get a more complicated program.  \n\nThe drawing shows a scaled portrait of the Caitlin Young, a 18-year-old from the United States, who was kidnapped in Nigeria and was held captive for two years.\n\nPolice have arrested a man in Australia who kidnapped an 18-year-old woman from Nigeria and held her captive for two years, according to reports.\n\nThe woman has been identified as Caitlin Young, an American citizen, and the suspect is 23-year-old Osman Quade, who was arrested this morning in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nCaitlin Young was kidnapped in the city of Kano, Nigeria, in February 2015 and taken to Lagos.

Globally, pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for 3.9 million deaths among children under five years old, accounting for 14% of childhood deaths \\[[@CR2]\\]. In developed countries, pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under five years old \\[[@CR2], [@CR3]\\]. Pneumonia is also the major cause of hospitalization for children under five years old \\[[@CR2]--[@CR6]\\].\n\nNtaya \\[[@CR7]\\] presented a systematic review of the literature on the factors that predispose children to pneumonia. Three important factors were identified: age, anthropometry, and malnutrition.\n\nThe first factor is age, age is one of the most important determinants of pneumonia. Children with a decreased concentration of lung fluid, a decreased number of alveoli, and a decreased number of alveoli per cubic millimeter of lung \\[[@CR8]\\] are at risk of developing pneumonia.\n\nThe second factor is anthropometric factors. The anthropometric factors include height, weight, chest-to-hip ratio (CHR), and head circumference. The mean value of CHR is between 0.60 and 0.84 for children aged five to 18 months. Children with high CHR have a higher risk of pneumonia \\[[@CR9]\\]. In addition, high body mass index (BMI) is also a risk factor for pneumonia. Low BMI is associated with pneumonia, as well as a high risk of malnutrition \\[[@CR10], [@CR11]\\].\n\nThe third factor is malnutrition. Malnutrition is a risk factor for pneumonia, as well as a risk factor for hospitalization \\[[@CR9], [@CR12]\\]. Malnutrition is defined as BMI equal to or less than the fifth percentile, as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO) \\[[@CR13]\\]. In the under five population, the prevalence of malnutrition is around 25% \\[[@CR14]\\].\n\nAlthough the WHO has developed a set of guidelines to describe the nutritional status of children, there is no consensus among countries over how to measure, diagnose, and treat malnutrition in children", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

What is meant by \"not very efficient\"?\n\nThe National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have published a new report on the performance of six major geothermal and solar power plants, which have been used to provide electricity to the U.S. for more than a century.\n\nThe report, which measures the performance of the power plants in terms of the power they produce, the power they deliver, and the power they consume, is based on the company's Electric Power Monthly (EPM) database, which contains data on the power plants' generation, transmission and distribution, and consumption.\n\nThe report, which has been accepted for publication by the journal _Energy Policy_ , finds that geothermal power plants produce an average of 7.7 megawatts, or MW, of electricity, while solar power plants produce an average of 1.7 MW.\n\nThe report also found that geothermal plants deliver an average of 9.3 MW and solar plants deliver an average of 4.3 MW to the U.S. power grid.\n\nGeothermal plants produced power that was 40 percent more efficient than solar, the report found, while solar plants produced power that was 53 percent more efficient than geothermal.\n\nThe report also found that geothermal plants in 2011 produced the most electricity, producing an average of 7.7 MW, while solar plants produced an average of 4.3 MW.\n\n### **POWER PLANTS AND ELECTRICITY**\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy estimates that by 2015 the U.S. will need to generate 20 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources.\n\nNREL, which works with DOE on renewable energy research, has been providing information on the performance of some of the world's largest clean energy power plants since 2009.\n\nWhile the report found no statistical significance in the performance of solar power plants compared to geothermal power plants, NREL and DOE noted that solar power plants were more efficient than geothermal plants.\n\n\"Solar power plants have had some significant performance improvements, but they still deliver about the same amount of power that geothermal plants do,\" said NREL's Gavin Mears, one of the report's authors. \"The main reason solar power is more efficient than geothermal power is that solar plants produce power at night, when the sun isn't shining", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

This assumption is justified because any surface tension will disappear in the process of mixing the oil, sugar and egg yolks.\n\nThe method is a simple extension of the classical thin film technique.\n\nThe techniques starts with a thin film of oil which is made with a low viscosity, fat-based liquid. This is a thickened oil, which will evaporate after a short time, leaving a thin film of oil. The thickness of the thin film can be measured by a calibrated refractometer.\n\nThe oil is first heated, to about the boiling point of water, and the viscosity of the thin film is controlled by the heating rate.\n\nThe thin film is then brought to the temperature of the egg yolks, and the thickness is measured again.\n\nIf the egg yolks are transparent, the thickness of the thin film will reflect the thickness of the egg yolk.\n\nA:\n\nYou don't need to use a refractometer. Liquid chromatography is a method that is used to analyze proteins.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20551214\n\nLiquid chromatography is a technique used to\n  analyze proteins. The technique is based on the fact that proteins have a fixed number of repeating units, called amino acids, which are coded by a genetic code, and that these units are arranged in a specific sequence. The technique uses a separation column, which is an apparatus or device that separates the proteins based on their specific sequence\n  of amino acids. The column is\n  filled with a matrix of\n  protein-containing fluid. By\n  changing the fluid in the column,\n  the proteins are separated according to their specific sequence of\n  amino acids.\n\nA:\n\nThe thin film of liquid is your mayonnaise.\nThe thickness of the thin film is the thickness of the mayonnaise.\n\n---\nabstract: 'We study the dynamics of spontaneous magnetization and magnetization reversal in a three-dimensional ferromagnet.

Why is this happening?", "assistant_prompt": ". What is the difference between the two derivatives?\n\nA:\n\nA derivative is a function that has an associated function and the associated function is, as you know, the function that you want to differentiate. The function of the derivative at any point is the second function.\nThe notation for the derivative is the differential notation. The notation for the second function is the partial differential notation. Where the derivative is being used is to differentiate the second function that you want to differentiate.\nYou can write the difference between a function and its derivative as the sum of its partial derivatives. For example, your function is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf(x,y) = x \\\\\ng(x,y) = y\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of this function are\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf_x = f(x,y)  \\\\\nf_y = f(x,y) - f(x)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe sum of these partial derivatives is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n2f_y = f(x,y) - f(x)  \\\\\n2f_x = f(x,y) - 2f(x)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nSo the difference between $f$ and its derivative is\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf(x,y) - f(x) - f_x = f_y - f(x)  \\\\\ng(x,y) - g(x) - g_x = f_y - g(x)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nNoting that the definition of the derivative is that it is the derivative of the second function, I can see that we've used the partial differential notation. The partial differential notation is defined as\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\nf_y = f(x,y) - f(x)\n\\end{array}\n$$\nTo evaluate this difference, we need to differentiate the second function.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\ng(x,y) - g(x) - g_x = f_y - g(x)  \\\\\nf_y = f(x,y) - f(x) - f_x\n\\end{array}\n", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

It was a good story, but it was a bit hard to follow along the plot as it was told in a fast pace and I had to stop the story to do some thinking.\n\nThe main character is one of those characters who you want to root for. I found it hard to stay interested in the story while I was reading it and I\u2019m not sure I would have been as drawn into the story if the characters had been presented a little more slowly and told in a slower and more straight forward fashion.\n\nThere was some humor in the story that served to lighten the mood.\n\nThe plot was well done, but I\u2019m not sure I could ever get into a book that was told in this way. I think I would rather read a book told in a more traditional fashion with a little more time to absorb the story.\n\nAs I said, I\u2019m not sure I would have enjoyed the story if the characters had been presented in a more traditional manner. The main character was a bit weak and I felt he was a bit too eager to be friends with the main character\u2019s brother and his girlfriend. He was always hopeful that the two of them would fall in love and settle down and I\u2019m not sure I would have been as pleased if they had been presented as a more realistic couple.\n\nThe other characters were entertaining but I felt that they weren\u2019t as well developed.\n\nOverall, I thought the story was well written. It was well written in a way that did not take away from the story and characters.\n\nThe story was interesting and well written and I think that, if the author had not taken a few liberties in the story, I would have been drawn into the story and would have been enthralled by the story.\n\nI would rate the story a four out of five stars.\n\nI have not read this book before so I can\u2019t comment on how the story would have been told if this", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

Chemokines, granzymes, and perforin were significantly higher in the patient group. The percentage of CD3+ cells and of CD19+CD20+ cells was significantly higher in the patient group. Peripheral blood CD3+ cells and CD3+CD4+CD8+ cells were significantly higher in the patient group. The percentage of CD19+CD20+ cells was significantly higher in the patient group. The percentage of peripheral blood CD4+CD8+ cells was significantly higher in the patient group. The percentage of CD3+CD4+CD8+ cells was significantly higher in the patient group. The percentage of CD3+CD4+CD8+ cells was significantly higher in the patient group. This study suggests that the immune system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of CLL and that the immune system may be one of the factors that contribute to the poor outcome of CLL patients.--\n-- (C) 2019-20 - ntop.org\n--\n\nlocal cmap = require(\"cmap\")\n\nlocal nmaps", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

However, a good starting point is to use the terms conscious, unconscious, and AI interchangeably. The difference is that AI is usually defined as a machine that can think. A human is an example of a machine that can think, but not be conscious. So for example, a human can do tasks in the unconscious, but would be considered to be an AI machine because it can think.\nThe issue here is that you're asking about the interface between a human and an AI. AI can be defined as a machine that can think, but is also able to do tasks that are not conscious. Human-AI interfaces can be defined as a machine that can think, but is also able to do tasks that are conscious.\nA good example of the difference is a computer game. A human player is a AI machine, but the game is still an AI machine, because it can think. The game is \"conscious\" because it does tasks that are conscious. The player is \"unconscious\" because it is unaware of these tasks. To represent this, I've added a non-linearity between the player and the game. The player does tasks, but the game is unaware of these tasks. The game is \"unconscious\" because it can think. The player is \"unconscious\" because it is unaware of these tasks. To represent this, I've added a non-linearity between the player and the game.\nSo, the player and the game are \"conscious\" because they do tasks that are conscious. The player is \"conscious\" because it does tasks that are conscious. The game is \"conscious\" because it can think. The player is \"unconscious\" because it is unaware of the tasks.\nHere is an example of an AI machine that is able to think. Consider the pathfinding system in The Sims. This is an AI system that can think, but is also able to do tasks that are not conscious. This is a good example of a system that is able to think, but is also able to do tasks that are conscious.\nThe goal", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.
