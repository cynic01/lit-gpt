The first instrument used for geodesy was the trigonometrical quadrant.  It was developed by Archimedes (287-212 BC) and was the first instrument to be used in geodetic work.  The trigonometrical quadrant was used to determine the length of the earth's ellipsoid, and the angle subtended at the focus of the telescope.  The trigonometrical quadrant remains in use to this day.  The first successful geodesy survey was made by the Spanish explorer Juan de Fuca, who sailed around Vancouver Island in 1792 and 1793.  The first GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite was launched in 1999, and it was used to determine the location of other satellites.  The first satellite used for civilian purposes was the Explorer 1, launched by the US Air Force on February 1, 1958.  Explorers 2 and 3 were launched in 1960 and 1962, respectively.  The first civilian GPS receiver was the first civilian satellite (C/Aglio) launched in 1992.  The first GPS satellite was launched in 1993 and has since provided precise location data to the public.

There are various reasons why people need money.\n\nIncome for basic needs\nPeople need money to buy food and other basic needs. Poor people especially depend on income from working to meet their basic needs. If they are unable to work, they will have to resort to borrowing or selling some of their belongings in order to purchase food or other basic needs.\n\nFinancial security\nPeople need money to invest in a bank account, vehicles, real estate, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. If they cannot afford to buy these financial products, they will have to rely on other sources of income to survive. For example, people sell their labor to make money.\n\nSocial status\nPeople need money to show their social status. People who own more money are perceived as more powerful, wealthy, and successful than those who do not. Therefore, those with more money are more likely to have a good social life and enjoy more social opportunities.\n\nProtection\nPeople may use money to provide a person with protection from personal or social risks. For example, a person might use money to buy insurance against a medical condition or a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a typhoon.\n\nCultural and religious beliefs\nPeople may use money to pay for cultural and religious rituals and customs. For example, people may use money to buy a new house or a new car as part of their religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to pay for the expenses of a trip to another country as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to pay for a business or personal service as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to pay for a wedding or other celebrations as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to buy supplies such as rice, flour and other grains, and other groceries as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to purchase essential items such as toothpaste, shampoo, soap, diapers, and other supplies as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.\n\nA person may use money to", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.
