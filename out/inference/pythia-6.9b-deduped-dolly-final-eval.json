The use of only a single guide RNA significantly reduces off-target effects compared to other genome-editing technologies such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) and Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs).\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 system is a prokaryotic immune system which uses a short guiding RNA to detect and destroy foreign DNA elements. The RNA directs the Cas9 endonuclease to a specific site in the genome and the nuclease recognizes the \"protospacer\" sequence on the foreign DNA and cuts the DNA at that site.\n\nIn TASCA, a short \"activation\" guide RNA is used which contains a sequence complementary to a sequence in the targeted DNA locus. When the two guide RNAs are expressed in the cell (usually as a chimeric transcript), the guide RNA that matches the activation sequence will give it priority to bind to the target DNA and the \"activation\" guide RNA will be able to bind to the \"normal\" guide RNA that would activate the Cas9 nuclease.\n\nThis gives the possibility to activate only the target locus and not affect other genomic loci which contain the \"normal\" guide RNA and the Cas9 nuclease.\n\nThe activation guide RNA can be designed to promote the expression of a gene of interest (that is normally silenced) or to inactivate a gene of interest, or to activate a cell's own DNA at a specific locus.\n\nThere are no ethical concerns in terms of using the TASCA technology, as the activation guide RNA is designed using publicly available algorithms and does not contain a Cas9 nuclease recognition sequence, so it does not induce Cas9 nuclease activity.\n\nIn September 2018, TASCA was featured on the cover of the journal eLIFE.", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

Therefore, Netflix needs to worry about keeping streaming video services free or close to free, because there is no \"cost\" to the middleman.
