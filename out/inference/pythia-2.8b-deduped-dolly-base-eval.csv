Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).

Extract the best known types of wood-decay fungi described in this paragraph and list them in a bulleted list.,"iliformis, funnel-shaped projection on the stem.

*Helminthosporium* is a monotypic genus of phoma-like fungi. This genus has been traditionally recognized for the fungi that have a doliiform to funnel-shaped mycelium and have a preference for living in the soil and also on dead plant parts. The most common species of the genus is *Helminthosporium maydis*. The first description of the fungus was by Clark and Stanley in 1913 ([@B285]). It was named and described by Geisinger in 1957 to accommodate fungi that are closely related to *Phoma* and *Leptosphaeria* species ([@B309]). *Helminthosporium maydis* is a pathogen and can cause severe diseases in both resistant and susceptible plants ([@B273]; [@B35]; [@B260]).

#### Mycoheterotrophic

##### *Mycoheterotrophic section* (*Tremellales*)

###### *Gymnosporangium*

*Gymnosporangium* belongs to the *Sporidiobolales* order of fungi. It is the only order that contains fungi that have a mycoheterotrophic lifestyle. It is a monotypic genus that includes the fungus *Gymnosporangium* sp. ([@B305]). It is a saprobic fungus that has a mycelium that is homothallic. The fungus is found to be widespread in the family *Melanosporaceae* and the genus *Gymnosporangium* ([@B305]). *Gymnosporangium* sp. is a fungus that is found to be soil-borne ([@B305]).

#### Nectriaceae

##### *Nectria*

*Nectria* belongs to the *Sporidiobolales* order of fungi and is the only genus that contains fungi that have a necrotrophic lifestyle. It has a mycelium that is heterothallic and is found to be soil-borne ([@B305]). *Nectria* is a genus that uses organic compounds known as nectriol and it is found in the genera *Cercospora, Coccidioides, Magnaporthe, Phialophora*, and *Stemphylium* ([@B305]).

You can also get one by locating a fire type Pokemon from a new region, then simply having Fire Burner as your new move. It has no effect if you already have it as your move, so it can be a nice bonus for people who do not want to go through the hassle of finding their fire type Pokemon.

I also recommend getting the Mewtwo Messenger if you want to have a Pokemon with the Mewtwo ability. This is a great move to have in your deck. I have to admit, I was unsure about getting this in the first place. I have had no problems with it so far.

As a bonus for those who don't want to use the new region finder function, you can also get a Pokemon with the Fire Flower ability in the wild.

Give me a list of pets that require low maintenance.,"

Kylee the cat

Iim pretty sure they are all too old to have horrible parasites.

Dirty little

I can't really remember, but I know I have to get a new litter box, get my cat groomed, and give her some fresh water every day. I gave her a large, soft, towel to lick off the litter box, and the cats are always a little jealous.

I have a cat, and I give her the bath, and give her food twice a day, and she lives a very happy life.

Cats can be very messy, and if there's a big pile of litter, it's a lot of work to clean it up.

Urukah

I clean his litterbox twice a week, and he gets a bath every week. I also give him a daily treat of food, and I have to clean up his bedding every once in a while.

Cats are messy, and that's part of their charm.

PoochPoo

Cats are messy, but I just buy a new litter box because I get so many.

""Giving a cat a bath is always a nightmare. The cat usually takes a shower, then bathes in the tub, then goes to the bathroom and does it all over again. Then we have to clean the tub with a brush, soap, and water, and I never know if the cat will leave a stain or not.""

Cats are messy and you have to clean up after them. I think the bath is a mess because it's messy and the litter box is a mess.

""I'm cleaning my cat's litterbox every day. It's not as easy as it sounds. I have to clean the box twice a day, and the litter is a mess. But my cat doesn't mind. I keep her very clean, and I always give her food and water. She is happy.""

I have two cats, and I clean their litterbox twice a week. I also give them food and water, and they lick their own food off the plates.

""I clean my cat's litterbox every day, and I give her treats. She is a little messy, but it's okay. I can't imagine how hard it would be if she was an adult cat. She is a little girl, and she is happy.""

When was the last flight of Concorde?,"ation?

The Concorde was built for the supersonic speeds of the jet age. Concorde, like modern airliners, was designed to fly at supersonic speeds. At supersonic speeds, the air is so thin - about a thousand times thinner than it is at subsonic speeds - that it is virtually impossible to stop the plane, even with a crash landing.

When Concorde first flew, it was the fastest, most powerful jet in the world. In 2003, it took off from New York's JFK Airport in less than two and a half minutes. That time was the fastest in the world until then. It was supersonic, and the fastest.

What was it like?

It was designed to fly at supersonic speeds, which means that the plane could fly at a speed of up to Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. In flight, the plane could hit speeds of up to 670 kilometres per hour.

The plane was not a regular passenger or cargo plane, and it was not designed to land on a runway. Instead, the plane was designed to glide back to the airport, as if it had taken a few moments to recharge its batteries.

Concorde made the first transatlantic flight in 1976. It was designed to be a plane that could carry people, and it could fly at a speed that was faster than anyone else could fly.

The plane was designed to fly at supersonic speeds, which means that the plane could fly at a speed of up to Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound.

In flight, the plane could hit speeds of up to 670 kilometres per hour.

The plane had to be able to fly at those speeds, because there was not enough room on the ground to build a runway big enough to accommodate it.

The plane flew on a runway that was just a few hundred metres long. This meant that it had to fly at a speed of more than 760 kilometres per hour, and it was not designed to fly at such extreme speeds.

E. Translate the given","Subtraction is an operation that identifies the total count of objects in a collection of items after a specific count of items are removed from the starting total.

You can subtract two numbers by starting with an initial count, which represents the number to subtract from, and a second count which represents the number to subtract.  Then remove one from the starting count repeating this operation for the number of items in the subtract value.  

Subtraction is not associative, which means that the order in which subtraction is performed matters.  For instance, seven minus five (7 - 3) equals four (= 4) but four minus seven (4 - 7) equals minus three (= -3).",0.023776,0.959601,9.990691,0.946322,0.025492,2.389176,-12.675392150878906

Why do I have blonde hair?,"ation of the hair follicles. The number of follicles is often proportional to the individual’s age. The hair follicles are destroyed, or blocked, by a process called anagen. This process is a result of the follicle’s own growth and the release of growth hormones. This blocks the follicles from being stimulated to grow, and as a result, the follicles do not grow. The follicle is not destroyed and can be stimulated to grow again. If and when the follicle is stimulated, it begins to produce more growth hormones, and the follicle begins to grow again.

For some individuals, the hair follicles are not blocked. Instead, the hair follicle is blocked from growing by certain external stimuli. These stimuli include the use of certain chemicals, hair dyes, and even molds. Properly stimulating hair follicles to grow is an important part of maintaining healthy hair. Once hair follicles are stimulated, they produce some of the hormones that help to keep the hair healthy. These hormones are known as androgens. It is these androgens that cause the hair to grow.

The hair follicles are stimulated to grow when the androgens from the androgens are released. The androgens stimulate the hair follicles to produce more androgens. Androgens stimulate the hair follicles to produce more androgens. Androgens, or male hormones, include testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and androstenedione.

Give me a list of golf ball options to use this weekend.," by the old guard.

Re: Must Have Golf Balls

I'm sure every one of you know that there are many types of golf balls, but for the sake of discussion let's just use the ones that we are all familiar with.

First, let's just get one thing straight: golf balls are made to be used. They are not car tires. They are not tennis balls. They are not air mattresses. They are not baseballs. A golf ball is a round object made of rubber, usually wound with thread, and some type of filler, usually in the form of pellets, that you can send into the same hole as the golf ball. You do not want to smash a golf ball in a ball pit.

Now, let's talk about construction. This stuff changes depending upon what kind of golf ball you are using.

(1) A solid ball made from a single piece of rubber is called a ""solid"")

(2) A golf ball made of multiple layers of rubber is a ""hybrid"")

(3) A golf ball made from a single piece of rubber and a layer of solid plastic is a ""hybrid"")

(4) A golf ball made from a single piece of rubber and a layer of solid plastic with an inner layer of liquid plastic is a ""liquid"")

(5) A golf ball made from a single piece of rubber and a layer of solid plastic with an inner layer of liquid plastic and a layer of solid plastic is a ""hybrid"")

(6) A golf ball made from a single piece of rubber and a layer of solid plastic with an inner layer of liquid plastic and a layer of solid plastic with an inner layer of liquid plastic is a ""liquid"")

I'm sure that you can see where I'm going with this. With these six types of golf balls, you have six different types of balls that you can use for your game. The first step to a solid ball is to use a liquid to fill the middle of the ball. Next, you use a solid plastic to fill the outer part.

(1) The first type, a ""solid""

(2) The second, a ""hybrid""

(3) The third, a ""liquid""

(4) The fourth, a ""hybrid""

(5) The fifth, a ""liquid""

(6) The sixth, a ""hybrid""

I've been dying to know this. I'm curious as to the backstory of what led to this situation.

I don't know much about the backstory, but I would have thought that non-extradition countries would have had a chance to extradite him. I mean, there is no treaty between the US and Saudi Arabia, so they would have had no right to extradite him.

But, I guess the US has been shaky about extraditing people to other countries, so I guess that's how he was able to get out of the US.

And, I don't know why he wasn't extradited to the US, but if it is due to extradition treaties between other countries, then I guess he could have been extradited to other countries.

I just wish he could have been extradited sooner. I know he was arrested in January, but it's been like 3 months since then.

This is the first I am hearing of it. I knew about the Saudi prince thing, but I didn't know that his arrest was due to a non-extradition treaty.

What is a spatial network?," of a network is a graph in which the vertices correspond to spatial entities and the edges represent spatial relations such as distance or proximity. In our study, the spatial network we constructed consisted of the locations of vehicle trajectories in the city of Bologna. A spatial network is not a traditional network but it is more appropriate for our research purposes. For example, in a traditional network, in order to build a connection between two nodes, it is necessary to know the distance between them. However, in a spatial network, the relationship between nodes is represented by spatial distance. In this way, the spatial network can be used to answer questions such as: how far are the two nodes, how close are the two nodes, and how well connected are the two nodes. In a spatial network, the nodes and links are not directly related to the geographical space (that is, the nodes and links are not directly related to geographical space). Instead, the nodes and links are directly related to the physical space. In the study, we used a spatial network where nodes represent the locations of vehicles and edges represent the spatial distance between the vehicles. The reason for constructing a spatial network is that in this way we do not need to know the geographical location of the vehicles. This is a crucial point for using the spatial network in our study, as we did not have access to geographical data. What are the limitations of the spatial network?The spatial network is not a traditional network, but it is more appropriate for our research purposes. Therefore, we can only consider the parts of the network that we need to use in our study. The spatial network is not a traditional network, but it is more appropriate for our research purposes.

What is the role of the spatial network in our research?The spatial network we constructed is used to answer questions such as: how far are the two nodes, how close are the two nodes, and how well connected are the two nodes. This is the main reason for building the spatial network. In our study, we used the spatial network to answer the following questions: How far are the two nodes in the spatial network? How close are the two nodes in the spatial network? How well connected are the two nodes in the spatial network?

2.2. Distance and centrality measures {#sec2.2}
-------------------------------------

In the literature, there are many distance and centrality measures that use the concept of spatial networks. The most","A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.",0.11225,0.995194,20.781415,0.97824,0.13772,4.600964,-3.737882137298584

Hasan T. Mollah, the Islamic State’s operational commander in the Afghanistan region, was killed in a drone strike in eastern Afghanistan.CreditMohammad Ismail/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images

Q.

I live in one of the worst-hit areas of Syria, and when I read about the death of Mr. Mollah, I was devastated. I’ve been in touch with people who are in Syria, and we think that the United States is responsible for his death. But I’ve also read that Mr. Mollah was killed in a drone strike. How is it possible that the United States can kill someone in a drone strike and then declare that it’s not responsible for that person’s death?

–Mohammad A.

A.

The United States has conducted a number of drone strikes against members of the Islamic State in Afghanistan, and it is possible that Mr. Mollah was killed in one of those strikes. But that is not the case, and you should not believe your sources.

The Islamic State is small and limited in operations in Afghanistan. It has only about 25 fighters, and it is not known whether Mr. Mollah was part of its organization. It is also not known whether he was killed by a drone strike or by the Taliban, or by the Afghan intelligence services, or, as you suggest, by the United States. It is possible that all of these things happened. But that is not the case.

Q.

What about the charges that the United States made last month against Mr. Mollah that he was involved in the killing of four American soldiers?

A.

There are two aspects to the charges against Mr. Mollah. One is that he was involved in the killing of four American soldiers, and the other is that he was involved in the killing of an American soldier. Both of those are true. But his involvement in the killing of four Americans is not the reason he was killed. He was killed because he was a known enemy of the United States and because he was a high-ranking member of the Islamic State.

Q.

Does the Islamic State have a presence in western Afghanistan?

A.

The Islamic State has a presence there, but it is small. There are about 40 to 50 fighters, and they are in eastern Afghanistan.

Why can't the whole world be 1 country?,"zentioBut why can't the whole world be 1 city? esto. In order to answer these questions, we need to consider the fundamental principles of the theory of city formation, which are the formation of the smallest possible spatial units (which we call proto-cities). The process of the formation of proto-cities is known as the agglomeration theory of city formation.

The agglomeration theory of city formation was introduced by the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre. He considered the special type of agglomeration that is the formation of proto-cities.[12]

Lefebvre found that the entire process of urbanization had a general tendency towards the formation of the smallest possible spatial units. These spatial units were called proto-cities. The agglomeration of proto-cities is not a new concept. The agglomeration of proto-cities has been described in the works of the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, Claude Shannon, and the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre.

The agglomeration theory of city formation is a theory of spatial organization of a city. That is, it is a description of how cities form.

The agglomeration theory of city formation describes how cities form from the aggregation or unification of the smallest possible spatial units. The smallest possible spatial units are called proto-cities. The formation of proto-cities from the aggregation of other units is a process that is described by Lefebvre.

The agglomeration theory of city formation is the first concept of the theory of city formation. The agglomeration theory of city formation explains why the formation of cities is not random. This is because the formation of proto-cities is guided by the principles of the formation of proto-cities.

The agglomeration theory of city formation says that cities form from the aggregation of other units. The aggregation of other units is guided by the principles of the formation of proto-cities. The principles of the formation of proto-cities guide the formation of other spatial units.

When was Telangana created?,"ation of Telangana on June 2, 2014, following a division of Andhra Pradesh. The UT is a union territory of Andhra Pradesh and is divided into two districts, one each for the Telugu majority and the Nizam's dominion. The Nizam's dominion was created by the Nizam of Hyderabad and comprises each of the 24 districts which are now parts of Andhra Pradesh.

The UT has its own legislature, the Telangana Legislative Assembly, which is elected through first-past-the-post voting. The Legislative Assembly was established in June 2014, after the establishment of Telangana state. A separate Legislative Council, with members directly elected under proportional representation, was constituted in December 2015.

Telangana State has its own flag, coat of arms and flag symbol, but the state is officially known by the name of the Nizam of Hyderabad Nizam Ali Khan. Telangana's state flag, designed by the Telangana State Flag Committee, features a white background with a blue Nizam's coat of arms in the center with a gold star falling on either side of the coat of arms. The state flag was approved by the President of India in August 2014.

The district of Karimnagar, which was merged into Telangana in 2014, has its own state flag.

History 

The Telangana region was under the Nizam's dominion for several decades in the nineteenth century, before being ceded to the British in 1809. The subsequent Hyderabad State, created in 1818, was dissolved in 1835. In 1854, the new princely state of Hyderabad was created, with its capital at Hyderabad. The state was ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad.

In September 1937, the Nizam of Hyderabad, then the ruler of Hyderabad State, declared Telangana as an independent dominion. The Nizam's dominion was created by the Nizam, and comprised the Telangana region, along with the Nizam's dominion states of Siddapur, Anantapur, Warangal, and Srikakulam.

The Nizam's dominion was abolished in 1950, but the Telangana region and state were not included in the new Andhra State, which was created in 1953. Rather, Telangana",2014,0.235514,0.999276,15.368632,0.997514,0.357717,3.591731,-4.233824253082275

How do I make good pour over coffee?,"

There are a few things to keep in mind as you get your pour over started.

1) Coffee beans are not as dry as they appear to be. They are usually about 60-70% moisture content. If you are using a wet burr grinder, make sure to get the beans to about 5%.

2) The drip coffee is not quite as dark as the beans. So, you will need to use a shade cloth or lid to filter the coffee as dark as possible.

3) If you are using a drip coffee maker, it is best to keep the coffee at room temperature.

4) When you are ready to make your coffee, you can take the coffee out of the drip pot and strain it through the filter.

5) The coffee will not be as dark as it would be if you were to drip over the beans. However, it will be noticeably darker than it is when you use a pour over method.

6) There is not quite as much richness as when you make a pour over. This is because the heat of the drip method is not as intense.","Start with a good pour over filter holder, preferably one made of borosilicate glass, and filters especially designed for pour over coffee, such as cone filters. Use a medium-coarse grind of coffee beans, and use filtered water instead of regular tap water. The recommended ratio for coffee to water is 1:15, which means for every 1 gram of coffee, use 15 grams of water. Pour the water over the ground coffee in a circular motion, with a first pour just wetting the coffee grounds, and a second pour slow and steady until to reach the correct ratio.

How to drink Coffee and Tea together

Coffee and Tea are as close as they can get to a match made in heaven, but when they're mixed together, it's like a delicious shot of espresso smashing with a cold, frothy cup of chamomile tea. Here's the best way to handle it.

If you choose to have espresso shot in your coffee or tea, add it to the hot water before pouring your tea or coffee. This will ensure maximum flavor and aroma.

If you choose to drink your coffee or tea black, you can add the espresso shot to the coffee or tea before pouring it. Just remember, it won't have the same flavor as the coffee or tea alone.

There are two ways to drink your Coffee and Tea together. You can either add the espresso shot to the coffee or tea first, or add the espresso shot to the hot water you're adding the coffee or tea to.

We recommend the latter method if you want to have a more classic drink. Or, if you want to add a little extra flavor to your cup of coffee or tea. But, if you're just looking to include espresso in your coffee or tea, just add it to the hot water before pouring.

How to drink Coffee and Tea with an espresso shot of your choice

If you'd like to add a shot of espresso to your coffee or tea, you can either choose to add it to the hot water before pouring, or you can just add it right when you pour the hot water.

If you choose to add it to the hot water first, you will get a shot of espresso flavor, but it will not have the same flavor as the coffee or tea alone.

If you choose to add it right when you pour the hot water, it will have the same flavor as the coffee or tea alone, but it will have more of an espresso flavor. This is the most flavorful way to drink coffee and tea together.

I would like to train a deep neural network to identify the most important names in a given list. I have the following data: names and embedding vectors. 
I have a pre-trained embedding vector of a name. The name is e.g. ""Stjepan Milosevic"". The embedding vector looks like this:
[0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5]

I would like to create a deep neural network that has the following structure:

The network should recognize the most important names in a given list.
The network should not be capable of recognizing the most important names in a list that is not present in the given list.
The network should not be capable of recognizing the most important names that are not present in the given list.

How can I accomplish this? More information: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/04/05/the-author-of-this-article-has-a-problem-with-deep-learning/comment-page-1/

A:

Let's say we have a list of names like the following:
[
    ""Saeed Abedini"",
    ""Bahram Beigi"",
    ""Mohammad Zarei"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari"",
    ""Mohammad Reza Akbari""
]

Note that the list can be arbitrarily long.
You could of course try your hand at doing this with a neural network. However, you should note that","Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum, etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study.

What is a reporting dashboard?

A reporting dashboard is a dashboard that tells you what is happening in your project. It tells you how many users are reporting an issue, and how many users have unfixed issues.

This way, you can keep an eye on the health of your project. If something is wrong, you can easily identify and fix it.

If you’re a user of a project, then you should know that reporting dashboard is a must when you’re using a project.

You should never leave a project to it’s fate.

When you leave a project to it’s fate, you’ll be wasting your time.

When you leave a project to it’s fate, you’ll lose the chance to fix the problems that could happen in the future.

You never know when a project will require a new feature.

You’ll never know when a project will require a new feature.

You’ll end up having to make a new release, and that could be a big bummer.

So when you leave a project to it’s fate, you have to know that you’ll lose a lot of time.

But you should never leave a project to it’s fate. You should know that you can always learn from that project, and that you can always learn about new things that other people will discover.

You should know that you can always learn from that project.

Looking from the front of a guitar, the thickness of the strings increases gradually from right to left. For a ukulele, the two outmost strings are the thinnest and the second left string is the thickest.

"Locate what the player should defend against in The Last of Us using the sample as a reference, extract them, and place them in a numbered list.","'s ""Apex Predator"" has a different, more complex solution. It's basically a high-tech version of the basic ""line-of-sight"" rule. You have a grid of hexes, each hex holding a number of enemies, and a number of ""safe"" hexes. Each enemy counts as 1 threat, and can be killed only by 2 enemies at once, so it takes 2 lines of sight for it to be defeated. ""Apex Predator"" is essentially a combination of ""line-of-sight"" and ""covering fire"" rules that work together.

Each enemy has a number of hit points, and it takes 2 lines of sight for it to be defeated. It also takes 2 lines of sight. I haven't figured out what it would take to defeat it with just 2 lines of sight, but the idea of ""covering fire"" is that if you have 3 enemies in a hex, your ""safe"" hexes are protected from them, so you can't be killed by 2. It's a bit like the ""covering fire"" rules in Commander Keen, but we're using the enemy structure in The Last of Us, so it's a bit more complicated.

You can use any kind of coffee. Instant coffee, cappuccino, espresso, etc. You want to use the best coffee you can afford. Try buying a good espresso or cappuccino machine. It can make a huge difference. It’s not just about the way you prepare it, it’s about the quality of the coffee you get.

The best way to drink coffee, according to me, is to start with an espresso. Then, add some dark roast to it. If you like it, add milk and the sugar you want.

You can also use a French press.

I have a coffee maker that I use to make my espresso, and I also use a French press. I use a glass French press that I got from the dollar store.

I like to start with my espresso and add some coffee creamer, and then I add a little bit of sugar. Then I put the lid on and I keep it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. I like to keep it in the fridge because it makes it more consistent.

You can also use a coffee grinder. There are a lot of good coffee grinders on the market. You can use a coffee grinder to grind your coffee.

I slid down the slope, the snow was slippery, and I almost went over a cliff, but I didn't. I was just a little bit scared. I was like, ""I'm so glad I'm not doing skiing,"" but I really wanted to do skiing.

The majority of skiers that I know, they're not afraid to try new things, and I think that's really cool.

I've never been a big adrenaline junkie. I like to ski, I like to snowboard, but I don't necessarily like to go out and risk my neck. Maybe it's just my personality. I think that if you're a skier, you should try as many different things as you can.

I have a lot of friends that have all these different interests, and I think that's very cool.

What's your favorite place to ski on a snowboard?

My favorite place to ski on a snowboard is","I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. 

Expediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.",0.80196,0.992978,17.512651,0.984631,0.828295,4.224103,-4.996964454650879

What is Acyl-CoA?,".

The C-terminal region of lipin is critical for enzyme activity and also contains the acyl-CoA binding site. Lipin proteins are expressed in most tissues, in particular in adipose tissue, and have been shown to be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Lipins are serine/threonine kinases that are involved in regulating pathways that control lipid homeostasis, including triglycerides, fatty acids, and phospholipids. Lipins are also involved in the regulation of signaling pathways that control cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation.

The human lipin gene family is composed of 6 genes. Lipin-1 is expressed ubiquitously in most adult tissues. Lipin-2 is highly expressed in the brain, whereas lipin-3 and lipin-5 are expressed in adipose tissue. Lipin-4 is expressed in the heart, whereas lipin-6 and lipin-7 are expressed in lung tissue. Lipin-1 and lipin-3 are able to transfer acyl groups from acyl-CoA to phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid. Lipin-2 can transfer acyl groups from acyl-CoA to a wide variety of lipid substrates. Lipin-1, lipin-2, and lipin-3 have been shown to be important in regulating the metabolic pathways that control triglyceride synthesis and lipid droplet formation in lipid-laden cells. Lipin-1 is activated by phosphorylation by lipin-2 in response to insulin.

The best part of the trade-in program is that you can get more cash for your car in exchange for you trading it in, or you can get a much higher price for your car compared to the price of a new one. And best of all, you can get a car for the exact same price as the one you traded in, and still have money left over in your pocket.

What is the best way to recover from a shoulder SLAP tear?

A shoulder SLAP tear is a common shoulder injury, and may be best told by the patient to “stop doing what you are doing and start doing what you are not doing.” The most common causes of a shoulder SLAP tear are:

a fall on an outstretched arm, especially one with a heavy load

a direct blow to the shoulder

a sports injury such as in hockey, baseball, lacrosse or softball

A shoulder SLAP tear is most often caused by a direct blow to the shoulder, and is commonly referred to as a “whiplash injury.” A shoulder SLAP tear may be the result of a direct blow to the shoulder with a force greater than the body’s ability to absorb. A shoulder SLAP tear can also be caused by a fall on an outstretched arm, which is the most common type of injury.

The shoulder SLAP injury is an injury to the supraspinatus muscle and tendon. The supraspinatus muscle is a large muscle that is found in the front of the shoulder. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for moving the upper arm.

The supraspinatus muscle and tendon are the most common injured areas in a shoulder SLAP injury. A shoulder SLAP injury is commonly considered a “whiplash injury,” in which the arm is violently thrown forward, resulting in a sudden and severe pain in the shoulder and arm.

A shoulder SLAP injury can cause pain in the shoulder and arm, with symptoms such as:

pain, tenderness, or a feeling of instability in the shoulder

tenderness and/or pain in the area of the shoulder blade

limited or limited range of motion in the shoulder

pain in the arm and shoulder with use of the arm

pain and/or tightness in the shoulder when the arm is raised above the head

Toe drag, where the affected limb shows significant mobility, but is not in a position to lift the affected limb

What is the best way to recover from a shoulder SLAP tear?

The first step in the recovery process after a shoulder SLAP tear is to ice, elevate the injury, and take the injured arm out of the sling or protective device. Ice is a very effective way to reduce inflammation. Ice can be used for several days after the injury. Ice is","Non surgical interventions include physical therapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles and increase range of motion as well as steroid and PRP shots.

If you're interested in these benefits, as well as losing weight, I recommend exploring ""Hot Yoga"" as a more intense variation. Another method of getting into shape is through strength training. This type of workout is focused on lifting weights to put stress on your muscles. This stress leads to micro-tears in your muscles, which heal to become even stronger than before! Some great strength training workouts include; Squats, bench press, and bicep curls. If you are looking to begin a workout regiment that you can do rather independently, running is a great option.

""In order to keep new products coming, you need production units running.""

That's impossible, at least in the near term.

In the near term, you need to increase the number of units you have running
and the amount of product you can produce.

My biggest problem with lean manufacturing is the non-labor resource -
automation. Lean manufacturing is a lazy man's way of automating factories.
It's not reinventing the wheel, but rather using the same things that
manufacturers have been using for years.

The other problem is that lean manufacturing is just a poorly defined term.
There's two basic ideas: 1. The factory is a closed system. 2. The factory
is a closed system, but you can add people.

There are plenty of lean manufacturing techniques that are very similar to the
ones I've used in the past (e.g. TMS, TMS plus a 5-day work week, using a
shiftless workforce, using a tool-optimised process, etc.). The fact that the
over-optimistic optimists have made their way to #1 is a big problem.

Not only do I not know what lean manufacturing is, but I have never heard of
it. Is it like the Toyota Production System? Is it like the lean manufacturing
method used by Whole Foods? Is it like what I do when I need to make money
quickly?

I understand this is a non-technical question. But I'd appreciate an answer
that isn't just ""it's like the Toyota Production System"".

Researchers at Columbia University found that the visual appeal of a product increased people’s desire to buy it by 58 percent in one study.

In another, people were more likely to give positive feedback to someone who wore a “fun” shirt than to someone who wore a more serious shirt.

In one study, a group of people was asked to choose between a shirt with a picture of a smiling person and one with a frowny face.

For the experiment, the group was randomly divided into two groups. One group was told that the person in the picture was famous, but the person in the other picture was unknown. The other group was told the opposite.

The results showed that the group that was told the person in the picture was famous was more likely to buy the shirt than the group that was told the person in the picture was unknown.

While meticulously looking over house balls with fingertip grips to feel like the pros, Jeff found one that caught his eye. The beautiful blue ball, with pink swirls and matching holes, already somehow had his same initials carved in.

As the two began to bowl, Jeff started with a strike. ""Oh, I like this one,"" he thought. Another strike! ""I could get used to this,"" he told himself.

Kyle was also bowling well, notching a strike and a 9-spare but nothing like what Jeff was doing on the lanes this fateful afternoon.

As Jeff lined up for his 3rd roll, his palms started sweating. The dreaded Turkey is where he got stuck so many times. But not today... ANOTHER STRIKE! Jeff jumped for joy.

According to the passage what is the best way of making progress with mathematics?,"ation. Give an example of a situation in which the author would use this approach.Contribution to mathematicsIt is the best way to make progress in mathematics, firstly because the author is working on the problem and secondly because of the possibility of finding an exact solution of the problem.Thus, the author is interested in the problem, and with the help of the method of the observation and experimentation he is trying to gain a hold on it.

1.5.1.2The use of the method of observation and experimentation in mathematicsIt is possible to study things that cannot be measured. For instance, it is possible to study the behavior of the orbits of a planet. But it is not possible to measure the distance of a planet from the sun. It is also possible to study the behavior of a pendulum or the behavior of a solid cylinder, but it is not possible to measure the length of the cylinder or the height of the pendulum. The method of observation and experimentation is used to study things that cannot be measured. It is also possible to study things that can be measured because they have some sort of a characteristic. The method of observation and experimentation is used to study things that cannot be measured. It is also possible to study things that can be measured because they have some sort of a characteristic. The author uses this method to study the behavior of the pendulum. However, he does not have a measure of the length of the pendulum. So, in order to find out the length of the pendulum, the author is going to use a tool called a ruler. It is necessary to measure two lengths: the length of the pendulum and the length of the ruler. The length of the pendulum is measured. The length of the ruler is measured. The author then compares the lengths of the pendulum and the ruler. Then, he finds out the length of the pendulum. After this, he finds out the length of the pendulum, and finally he finds out the length of the pendulum.

how is yogurt made?,".

Yogurt is made by placing a container with lukewarm milk and a spritz of liquid citric acid or potassium sorbate on top. (The acid allows the bacteria to grow, and the spritz aids the growth. The potassium sorbate is not heat sensitive, so it can be used in yogurt made in a home kitchen.)

The bacteria and fungi in the milk feed on the sugar in the yogurt and convert it into lactic acid—a natural preservative. Once the yogurt is made, it is refrigerated.

Yogurt is often made with a base of milk that's been salted or sweetened. This is called yogurt cheese. You can also make yogurt cheese without the salt and sweetener.

Cultured, non-fat, and low-fat yogurt are made by allowing yogurt to ferment in a large container or crock.

If you are not familiar with yogurt, which is a fermented milk product, you can find more information about it at your local health food store.

For a delicious and easy yogurt, try the yogurt in this recipe.

How was the Iraqi embassy in Beirut destroyed?,". The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the ensuing War on Terrorism have been two of the most important events in the history of the world. As we continue to fight this war, we can't forget the tragic events of Sept. 11, the official explanation of which is that terrorists flew passenger planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York City and the Pentagon. The U.S. government's explanation of the attacks is that the terrorists hijacked four planes, flew them into the towers, and then crashed them into the buildings. And the official story is that the Bush administration was trying to stop further attacks on the U.S. homeland. The 9/11 attacks have been a major catalyst for the War on Terrorism, which is why the U.S. government spends more than $1 trillion a year in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. government is the only government in the world that has the capacity to conduct a war against its own people. If 9/11 were an attack on our country, then the Bush administration was right to respond to the attacks. But it wasn't an attack on our country. It was an attack on the Bush administration. It was an attack on our system of government. It was an attack on our way of life. It was an attack on the very essence of our American way of life. It was an attack on our basic principles of freedom and the rule of law.

A good children's story should have repetition, relatable characters, and predictability.

Extract all of the names of people mentioned in this paragraph and list them using bullets in the format {Name},"ated.

Let’s begin by finding the text we are looking for:

<div>2</div>

Let’s use the Regex class to find all of the div tags that contain text, and then use the .find() method to find the first instance of the text we are looking for:

<div>2</div> . find ( 'div' )

<div>2</div>

Let’s now use the find().* method to find all of the text in the div tag:

<div>2</div> . find ( 'div' ). *

2

Now that we have the text we are looking for, we need to match the text against our RegEx pattern:

<div>(.*?)</div>

<div>(.*?)</div>

Now that we have matched the text we are looking for, we need to extract all of the names:

<div>(.*?)</div> . groups ()

We can now use the .first() method to get the first group:

<div>(.*?)</div> . first ()

Denis,

I don't know if this is the case for you, but I've had a feeling that the Fed has really been trying to implement the QE3 plans. Maybe this is because the QE2 plans were too unstable to implement?

The Fed's been reluctant to do QE3, since it's been focusing on the housing market recovery and other things, but the QE3 plans are supposed to be more stable than QE2.

I think the Fed's been waiting to see if the housing market really recovers before taking these steps. If it doesn't, then I think the Fed will take the steps sooner than we think.

Yes, I agree that the Fed has been waiting, but I don't think that's why. I think the Fed is waiting to see if there is a ""global recession"" (as opposed to a ""global slowdown"") before it takes further steps. The Fed is waiting because it's unsure if the largely unforeseen housing-market recovery is sustainable.

In other words, the Fed is waiting to see if there are enough signs of a slowdown in the economy that it will be able to repair the damage it has done.

I think the Fed is waiting to see if there are enough signs of a slowdown in the economy that it will be able to repair the damage it has done.

That's my understanding as well. I think the Fed is waiting to see the economic environment before making any large-scale moves. In particular, the Fed is waiting to see if we'll see a recession that is deeper than the one we just had. That's where they'll most likely start QE3.

If there is a recession at that time, the Fed will be able to initiate QE3 much more quickly and effectively than if it doesn't. If it doesn't, they will wait.

That's my understanding as well. I think the Fed is waiting to see if there are enough signs of a slowdown in the economy that it will be able to repair the damage it has done.

I don't think it's just about the economy, though. I think","1- Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy action in which the government buys bonds and other assets to keep long term interest rate low to stimulate the economy.

What is SMTP?,"ication.

What is SMTP? - What does it do?The Mail System Transfer Protocol, or SMTP, is a protocol that allows two people to exchange messages over a network. In SMTP, the message sender sends a message to the receiver. The message recipient defines the address of the electronic mail address where the message should be sent. In addition, people can send messages to each other. The message recipient specifies the address by which the message is to be sent. A message has a limited amount of information. It is limited to 90 characters, and it is sent in a single line.

Why is SMTP important?SMTP is one of the ways that people communicate with each other. With SMTP, you can send email messages to friends, colleagues, and family members. You can also send messages to people who don’t use email. SMTP email is a very popular method of communicating. At any given time, there are a large number of places where people can send email messages. SMTP is a very popular method of emailing.

What are the different SMTP options?There are two types of SMTP. The first type of SMTP is called HELO and STARTTLS. HELO is used to send a message to an unregistered recipient’s email address. HELO messages are sent to a hostname that doesn’t exist. HELO is used to send a message to a mail server. HELO messages have a return path that specifies where the message should be sent. The return path is the address where the message should be sent. HELO messages are sent from a SMTP server to a mail server. HELO is used to send a message to a mail server.

Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per RFC 8314. For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols.",0.047917,0.070733,34.732689,0.065537,0.036759,6.990727,-3.0282468795776367

Please summarize the history of the development of Roche Percee based on this article,".

Thank you for the opportunity to review this article.

Reviewer \#2:

The authors have made a substantial effort to address the points raised by the previous reviewer.

Concerns regarding motivation for the study and response to comments:

1\. I agree with the reviewer that it was not clear that the researcher was motivated by an interest in the area of caregiving. There are a number of reasons why the researcher may be motivated by a desire to develop a safe caregiving environment, while others may be motivated by a desire to develop a home for the person with a diagnosis of dementia in order to provide a supportive environment for the person with dementia to live. The researcher has not clarified which of these reasons motivated her to undertake the study.

Response: In the revised manuscript, we added the following sentence to the introduction: ""However, to investigate the potential of the Percee system to support caregiver well-being, an interest in the area of caregiving was also required.""

2\. I also agree with the reviewer that the researchers response to the positive comments made by the previous reviewer was not clear.

We thank the reviewer for this comment. We added the following sentences to the revised manuscript to address the concerns of the reviewer:

Write a short story about a toddler and her imaginary friend. She is with her family and excited but nervous about the new surroundings,". She loves to play games and watch the people around her.

*This story is written from the perspective of an imaginary friend. The writing is thought provoking and fun to read. There are some character flaws but you'll learn to love her.

This story is based on the real life experiences of a toddler named Olivia. I wrote this story a few years ago when I was trying to write a story. It was a way for me to stop overthinking things and just write.

I wrote this story in the first person because I wanted to see what it would be like to be someone else. I wanted to see what it would be like to live through their eyes.

I hope you enjoy it. And if you do, I would love if you would leave a comment. I read every one of them. :)

P.S. I changed a few things...

My name is Savannah Mere and I have a boy named Connor. He is 7 and was born with a severe heart defect. He has a heart as big as a beach ball, it is so big that he can't breathe on his own, but he keeps getting better. I have been writing to help him heal, and to help him remember the things that he's loved. I write in the first person because I want to see what it would be like from his perspective.

What I've learned so far:

Before I started writing, I thought that people could only think about themselves. But, I now know that they can think about themselves and also think about others.

When I was a kid, I was really into the TV shows. I loved the X-men, Iron man, and many other shows. I also loved to read. I loved the books I read so much that I decided I wanted to write.

I thought that writing would just be fun. I didn't think that it would be anything that I would enjoy. But, now, it is.

I love writing, and I love that I am able to do it. My stories make me happy, and they make me feel good.

What are the potential source of energy for an engine?," of energy that may be extracted from the fuel. Impossible to determine. Because the fuel is a complex compound, it is difficult to predict exactly how much energy is in the fuel. This is also true for any other substance. If the fuel is an element, it is possible to determine the energy content. Also, if the fuel is a compound, then the energy content can be calculated by adding the energies of the individual elements. The energy content of a compound can be calculated by using the energy of each component. For example, if the fuel is a carbon compound, such as, cellulose, its energy content can be calculated by adding the energies of the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). If the fuel is an alcohol, such as methanol, its energy content can be calculated by adding the energies of the hydrogen and oxygen (H2O). Fuel molecules are drawn in the direction of the arrow. This is the direction of the flow of energy in the engine.Energy content of fuel = (energy of each component) × (number of molecules in fuel) If the fuel is a compound, the energy content of the fuel can be calculated by adding the energies of the individual components of the compound. For example, a fuel such as methanol is a compound of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) and has an energy content of (H2O) × (1/2). Because energy is transferred from the fuel to the piston, the energy content of the fuel will be transferred to the piston, and energy will be added to the cylinder. Energy is also released from the piston as the piston moves forward. The energy content of a fuel is not the same as the energy content of a piston. The energy content of a piston is the energy of the piston. The energy content of a compound is the sum of the energies of the individual components of the compound. For example, the energy content of methanol is the sum of the energies of the hydrogen and oxygen. Energy is transferred from the piston to the cylinder. The energy content of the piston is determined by the amount of energy that is transferred to the piston from the fuel. Energy is transferred to the piston from the fuel by the movement of the piston forward. The amount of energy transferred is determined by the shape of the piston, the surface area of the piston, and the velocity of the piston. The energy content of the piston is equal to the amount of energy transferred. The energy content of the cylinder is equal to the amount of energy transferred. The amount of energy transferred to","Potential sources of an engine includes potential energy, heat energy chemical energy, electrical energy and nuclear energy.",0.210262,0.998164,23.680237,0.988333,0.309434,5.237286,-3.0035459995269775

Is PM Modi is honest," Sumitra Mahajan and Narendra Modi are partners of same.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar did not let go the chance to target the BJP on the nation's 1,000th death anniversary yesterday.

After the convoy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi passed through the state capital Patna, Kumar said: ""This is the day when we remember the martyrs of the nation. We pray that no one should lose their life on this day.""
He also said that the Congress would always keep the nation's national interest in front.

The Bihar Chief Minister said that he was happy that the Prime Minister had held a meeting with the leaders of the opposition parties.

""I congratulated the Prime Minister for this meeting and expressed that we are friends who always talk and help each other. Narendra Modi is honest, shows the face of a true friend. Sumitra Mahajan and Narendra Modi are partners of same,"" he said.

""Earlier, we (Congress) were worried about the BJP coming to power. But now we are thinking about our country. The BJP is not an enemy of the country,"" Kumar said, adding that ""the BJP is not a party of minorities"".

""We have no problem with the BJP, but it should not be a party for minorities. It should be a party for all people,"" Kumar said.

Earlier, Prime Minister Modi had met Nitish Kumar and spoken about the differences between the two parties.

The Bihar Chief Minister, who formed an alliance with the BJP in the last Lok Sabha elections, is one of the most prominent leaders of the opposition.

Kumar and the BJP are also at odds over the implementation of the Land Acquisition Bill. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on July 27 but has not been brought to the President's Rule.

The bill is seen as a way for the central government to acquire land for industrial projects in Bihar.

It did not really look very good, and I used chemicals to keep the roots from rotting. I did not like the smell of it, and it was not very healthy. So, I decided to get a few plants that I could keep in pots, and give the wrong location to the right plants. Now I have a couple of plants that I took care of. I still keep my large plant. I am not so sure that is a good idea to take care of it. I usually make sure that it gets enough sunlight and water.

# Palaces and Palimpsests

_The original idea for the ""Palaces of the Habsburgs"" came from an ignorant schoolboy who wrote to a newspaper: ""The Habsburgs have palaces, and one of them is right here in Vienna. The palaces are for the Habsburgs, and the Habsburgs are not to be seen.""_

I think that when one writes a history of the Habsburgs, one really has to be very careful about putting the Habsburgs into pictures. There are some pictures of the Habsburgs that are almost as interesting as the history itself.

The reason that the Habsburgs are not in pictures is that they are not just any people. They are the only people in the history of Europe who have been extremely successful in keeping alive their royal identities. They are the only people who have worked like mad to preserve their power and their royal identities. It is a fascinating story.

## **The Great Palaces of the Habsburgs**

When I was a boy, I used to look at the pictures of the palaces of the Habsburgs in the library. What I discovered, as I have hinted in this book, was that in a small country like Austria, it is hard to know how to preserve your identity. This is especially true of the Habsburgs, who are incredibly proud of their royal status.

So, I learned to avoid the palaces of the Habsburgs. I did not want to be reminded of what I was not allowed to see.

It is not until you come to Vienna that you will see the palaces of the Habsburgs. You will be able to see them, but after you have seen them you will want to forget about them. You will be so excited by their beauty, and you will see the palaces as they really looked in the past.

It is interesting that when I go into the palace of the Habsburgs,","The Arctic tern flies a round trip of 21,750 miles a year, breeding in the Arctic in the northern summer and feeding in the Antarctic during the southern summer.

What is a simple recipe for a margarita?,"To be honest, I thought this drink was a bit of a fail. I would be more interested in a margarita made with tequila or scotch than the stuff from the bottle. But it was a nice way to use up the bottle of tequila that I bought. My son wanted to try it again, and I thought since it was a quick and easy recipe, I would share it with him. I am glad I did, it was really tasty! It was tasty with some fresh lime juice and salt. My son liked it with salt and some lime juice. I thought that it would be a nice way to use up the tequila in the bottle. You could make it with regular or triple sec tequila, or any other type of alcohol. The recipe below is for regular tequila. You can use any type of alcohol.

Mix:In a small pitcher pour about 1/4 of the tequila and mix with a spoon. Add a little more tequila until you have a good amount of liquid.

Pour:In a glass measure add about 2 ounces of the remaining tequila. Stir until it is fully mixed in.

Lemon Zest:Cut the lemon in half and scoop out the juice. Add the juice to the pitcher. Add the lemon zest to the pitcher.

Lime Juice:Add the juice of 3 limes to the pitcher.

Salt:Add a little salt to the pitcher.

Stir: Stir the pitcher until it is fully mixed in.

Serve:Serve the margarita in a glass with a straw. Add a lime wedge or wedge of lemon to the glass.

For the sake of the recipe, I added a little salt, lime juice, and lemon zest to this drink. You can add whatever flavorings you want to this drink.

This is a simple recipe that can be made as long as you have fresh lime juice, salt, tequila, and a pitcher.","A simple margarita can be made using just tequila, lime juice, and simple syrup. Alternatively, margarita sweet and sour mix can be bought from the store and will need to be mixed with tequila.",0.62854,0.998382,25.470604,0.972125,0.657998,5.74553,-4.590880393981934

","An oil is a chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and may be animal, vegetable or petrochemical in origin.
Oil is used in a wide range of applications and is essential to everyday human life. These are:
Cooking - edible vegetable and animal oils are used for various purposes in cooking and food preparation
Cosmetics - most facial cleansers, lotions and hair care products contain molecules that come from mineral and vegetable oils
Fuel - crude oil is refined and converted to diesel, gasoline or jet fuel to power cars, trucks and planes
Heating - petrochemical oil is used for heating
Painting - oil is used as a supporting medium for paints
Lubrication - oils are used in various engineering purposes as they do not easily adhere to other substance which makes them useful as lubricants
Religion - oil has been used throughout history as a religious medium. It is often considered a spiritually purifying agent and is used to anointing purposes

It's also a triumph and a masterpiece, a virtuoso performance."" In The Sunday Herald, critic Eric Kohn rated it at 3 stars, saying, ""The album is enjoyable, ambitious, beautiful, strong and totally flawless.""

1. Purpose: the purpose of usage should be clear in mind, i.e., whether it's for hearing good quality music or for work like taking video calls.
2. Price Performance: Money is always an important consideration when it comes to any sort of purchase.
3. Active Noise cancellation (ANC): Although noise cancellation is coming with most headsets nowadays, the quality of ANC might vary from one piece to another. So it's always good to read some reviews around it.
4. Mobile application and features: It is almost a norm now that every major headset company has developed the corresponding mobile application with some add-on features. But some companies offer much for fine-grained controls than others.
5. Carry case: If you are a frequent traveller, then a compact and robust headset carry case might be good to have in certain situations.",0.31461,0.000515,34.579701,0.895902,0.292987,7.216743,-5.0842084884643555

### **Fuel Efficiency**

##### **Batteries**

To ensure that your car will perform as well as it should, the battery is a crucial component. A car without a battery is not ready to drive. Therefore, you should always ensure that your battery is in good condition. The following are the best things to look for when shopping for a battery:

• Check the seal. The seal on a battery should be tight and firm. If it feels loose, it is probably overheating.

• Label the battery. A battery should have a label with the power and the time the battery can be used. This is important if you plan on driving your car a lot.

• Check the charger. The charger should be in good condition. It should be fast and efficient.

• Try not to lose the battery. You will not be able to replace it if you lose it.

• Check the cables. They should be in good condition.

• Check the connectors. Make sure the connectors are tight.

• Check the terminals. The terminals should be smooth and clean.

• Check the terminals for any cracks. If any cracks are present, they should be sealed.

• Check for corrosion on the terminals. Corrosion is the main cause of a bad battery.

• Check the cables. The cables should be in good condition.

• Ensure that the battery is in good condition.

##### **Braking System**

Braking is one of the most important aspects of driving a car. You should ensure that your brakes are in good condition. The following are the best things to look for when shopping for a braking system:

• Check for cracks. Cracks can occur at any point in time. It is not wise to buy a car with brakes that are not in good condition.

• Check for wear and tear. If the brakes are worn, they will be less effective.

• Check for leaks. Brake fluid should be in good condition. If it is missing, you will be able to drive the car with only extra fluid.

• Ensure that the brakes are in good condition.

What is National Financial Switch or NFS?,", the National Financial Switch (NFS), is a group of 29 co-ordinating organisations working to ensure that the railways and road (as well as the air) are safe and reliable, providing a viable transport system for the UK.

Mayors and business leaders from across the UK have signed a letter to the Prime Minister urging him to put forward his Brexit deal.

The letter says the deal is the only viable option that will ensure no-deal is avoided.

""As a result of the EU's failure to deliver Brexit in a way that works for the UK, we are now in the situation where the UK is being forced to leave without a deal,"" the letter says.

""We are urging the Prime Minister to reconsider the deal and put it to the British public in a referendum.""

""This is a last-ditch attempt to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The British people deserve at least a vote on the deal, not just the promise of one.""

""We are calling on the Prime Minister to put this deal to the British people in a referendum.""

Mr Davis said the government was looking carefully at the details of the document and ""we will do our best to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both sides"".

""We are not in a position to make any further comment at this stage.""

The European Union has said it is willing to ""rework"" the Brexit deal to address the concerns of the UK - but the UK has not said if it will accept it.

The government should abandon any attempt to renegotiate the deal and unite for the ""best deal for the UK"", the prime minister said.

""We believe, as the House of Commons has made clear, that it is the best deal for the UK.

""But it is not the only deal on the table.""

Brexit - the facts

What does the deal mean for the Irish border?

The EU says it will ensure a ""functional"" border in Ireland - a customs border to prevent goods from going in and out of the country without the proper checks.

The government says no customs checks will be needed on the island of Ireland.

The EU says it will ensure a ""workable"" solution for Ireland - but it also points out that the UK's ""Chequers plan"" was rejected by the EU in December.

What are the key points of the deal?

It includes","National Financial Switch (NFS) is the largest network of shared automated teller machines (ATMs) in India. It was designed, developed and deployed by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) in 2004, with the goal of inter-connecting the ATMs in the country and facilitating convenience banking.

Can you please tell some details about Malhar Rao Holkar from the given text?," Malhar Rao Holkar
is the guru of Holkar, his wife was the daughter of Holkar's brother-in-law.
They have two sons, Rathore and Holkar. She is known as Holkar's aunt.

A:

Rathore was the son of Sindhia, the younger brother of Holkar. 
It's mentioned in the book ""The Conquest of India"" by V.N. Ojha. 
It says:

Holkar was the son of Sindhia and his wife, Rathore. She was the daughter
  of Holkar's brother-in-law, and Holkar's mother was the sister of the
  Jotiba
  or “Jubbai,” who was Holkar's aunt, and was Holkar's grandfather.
  Holkar's mother was the daughter of his aunt, Jotiba, who was the
  sister of Holkar's grandfather, Sindhia.

Rathore was held in high reverence because he was the son of Holkar. 
So, Rathore was Holkar's second son.
The book ""The Conquest of India"" goes on to say:

Rathore received the title of ""Rathore"" from his father, Holkar. The
  title of ""Rathore"" was given to Holkar's second son, Rathore, because
  Holkar was the son of his own son, Rathore, and his grandfather was
  Sindhia, who was Holkar's paternal grandfather.

However, the book ""The Conquest of India"" goes on to say:

Holkar's aunt, Jotiba, was Holkar's mother, and Holkar's mother was the
  daughter of his uncle, Jotiba. Holkar's mother was the sister of
  Holkar's grandfather, Sindhia.

I'm guessing in the last sentence, Sindhia is the father of Holkar's aunt, Jotiba.
However, the book ""The Conquest of India"" goes on to say:

Holkar's mother was the sister of Holkar's grandfather, Sindhia. Sindhia
  and his wife, Jotiba, were the parents of Holkar's father, Sindhia.

So","1. Malhar Rao Holkar (1694–1766), a Maratha, established the Dynasty's rule over Indore.

What makes a Korean corn dog different from an American corn dog?,": Your kimchi is the secret ingredient.

blues from the other side of the tracksI just saw a movie called “Hoop Dreams” about kids in the inner city who used to play hoops and now those kids are in jail. It was sad and I thought, “This could be me.” Wanting to be a basketball starMany people think that being a professional basketball player is what it takes to make it in Hollywood. I think that it's being smart, working hard, and being able to handle rejection.

Sneak peek at the new clothing line from the K-Pop star who is also an author J-Hope. He's currently on hiatus from his group BTS so you can find out more about his new clothing line and book.

I'm a Korean and I'm so proud of Korean women and that's why I really want to open up more about the Korean women's movement. From a young age, I was always around women who were working and doing things. I would see them everywhere. I remember seeing them in the grocery store being really knowledgeable about their jobs and also seeing them in the gym, doing push ups.

I don't think that we need to feel like we have to be perfect or even be accepted by everyone. I think that we all need to be accepting of one another, and I think that we have to embrace each other. I don’t think it's that much of a struggle to be a Korean woman in the United States. I think that's something that we can do.

I'm not sure if it's a movie or not, but I definitely want to see it. I just saw it the other day in a movie theater. It's called “A Raisin in the Sun.” It was really good. I didn't really have a lot of expectations when I saw it. I just saw it. I loved it. I thought it was really cool. I liked the plot of it and the acting was good. It was definitely different than any other movie that I have seen.

I actually wrote a book. My first book came out in 2007, and it was called “Let’s Talk About It.” It’s about not letting other people’s opinions affect you. I wanted to show that just because you’re a person that doesn’t mean that you have to be affected by other people’s opinions.

The main character in the book is a girl named Am","Korean corn dogs differ from American corn dogs in the ingredients they use.

Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.  Make the case to a skeptical colleague as to why private sector managers should devote attention and energy to being a steward of the institutions of capitalism. Please include citations for Jonathan Haidt.,"ation is a major economic and social problem, and its solution requires the attention of many people. Please include citations for Paul Graham.

A:

I think the best way to approach this is to say that the only way we can be sure that the modern economy will work is to have a large sample of the population that are willing to pay for it.  If a large enough majority can't afford to pay for a given service, we may have a problem.
For example, suppose that most people have the opposite opinion of you or me, that we are being paid to do a certain task.  I have a rather large sample of people willing to pay me to do a certain task, but for most people my opinion is not worth much.  If the majority of people who thought I was being paid to do the task had found me, I would be toast.  I am convinced that we need to have a large enough sample of people willing to pay for a particular job that the majority of those who think it is worth something are willing to pay for it.  If I have a sample of people willing to pay me for a task, but most people don't think I'm worth it, I am toast.
I think the same is true of the economy as a whole.  People with an opinion that it is worth investing in the market economy can be convinced that it is worth investing in the market economy, and if they can convince themselves that it is worth investing in the market economy, the market economy will grow and prosper.

","To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to 
those relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs. As individuals count on business leaders to respond to our world’s most prevalent issues, business leaders also hold a social obligation to do so with",0.996532,0.996153,8.390113,0.997094,0.99782,2.475542,-4.007746696472168

1. Limit multitasking: While it may feel more productive, you can easily get distracted and spend more time on those tasks overall. Instead, try to complete one task to a higher standard in less time.
2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.
5. Delegate: If you are part of a team, consider collaborating with team members more closely. Delegation",0.800274,0.998468,30.653548,0.998271,0.788213,6.847755,-3.0269453525543213
"Vanessa and Lauren are both 32-year-old women with different levels of exercise experience. Vanessa, who weighs 124 lbs, has lifted weights before but Lauren, who weighs 166 lbs, has never participated in resistance training. Both women participate in initial fitness assessments and want your advice about starting a muscular fitness program at your exercise facility. Choose a different test to measure each woman's upper body muscular strength. Briefly explain the procedures for each assessment. What common errors should you watch for?",".doc

What is the difference between an upper body muscular strength test and a muscular fitness test?How do you properly conduct a muscular fitness test?

Before you read the rest of this section, take a moment to complete the quiz and review the instructions.

Three common errors to watch for when conducting muscular fitness tests include:

• Asking the subject to raise only their arms. In this case, you want to measure upper body muscular strength and not just upper body muscular strength. You should avoid asking your subject to keep their arms at their sides in this test.

• Asking the subject to keep their arms straight out in front of them. The arms should be straight and parallel to the floor.

• Asking the subject to keep their arms at their sides. The arms should be straight and parallel to the floor.

When conducting upper body muscular strength tests, the arms should be kept at their sides in a horizontal position and parallel to the floor.

Upper body muscular strength is a measure of how much force you can use to lift a weight or resistance off the ground. You should measure upper body muscular strength in a testing environment that allows you to maintain a stable base of support. The stability of the floor is important. If you have to place the feet on a piece of plywood or a box to maintain a stable base of support, you will not be able to measure accurate upper body muscular strength.

To measure upper body muscular strength, you will stand behind your subject and place the weight in the subject's hands, keeping the subject's arms at their sides. If the subject is able to lift the weight off the ground, you have measured upper body muscular strength. You can use a standard weight or a barbell. A barbell is a piece of metal that is the same weight as your subject. The subject places his or her hands on the barbell and lifts it as high as possible. The subject is then allowed to rest for a few seconds and is then asked to lower the weight to the ground. The higher the weight is, the more upper body muscular strength the subject has. The maximum weight that you can use in the upper body muscular strength test is between 70 and 80 percent of the subject's body weight.

How do you properly conduct a muscular fitness test?

You should conduct a muscular fitness test in a way that allows you to measure maximum muscular strength. The muscular fitness test consists of the following components:

• Start with a","For Vanessa, we’ll choose for her to perform a one-rep max assessment, specifically with the bench press. This is because she has experience with lifting weights. To start, she should warm up by completing several submaximal repetitions. We’re going to select an initial weight of 50-70% of her capacity, and progressively increase resistance by 2.5 to 20 kg until the subject cannot complete the repetitions. The final weight lifted should be the absolute 1-RM. Some common error we want to watch for is to make sure that the repetitions are performed at the same speed of movement and range of motion to ensure consistency. Additionally, on the setup portion, we should check the surroundings for hazards, set the bar to the right height for Vanessa based",0.040926,0.863084,21.259695,0.724723,0.030792,4.583844,-4.654024600982666

At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard.",0.08742,0.998167,0.657866,0.991659,0.077721,0.562567,-4.133881568908691
What are the five biggest centers of Sufism?,"cors

What are the five biggest centers of Sufism?

This is a good question. The five biggest centers of Sufism are Mecca, Medina, Damascus, Jerusalem, and Istanbul. Not all of these are actually centers of Sufism as the term may be defined. However, as you will see below they each have a number of holy places that are most notable in the history of the Muslim world. Each of them also has a special role in the history of Islam, and each of them is a symbol of a major Muslim belief.

Mecca

Mecca is the holiest place in the Islamic world. The Kaaba is the most important site for Sufis, and it is a site for a number of other major Islamic beliefs. People from all over the Muslim world come to Mecca to perform Hajj,a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Kaaba is also a significant symbol of the Islamic faith as it was built by Abdul Muttalib, son of the Prophet Muhammad, and is a symbol of the worship of God.

Medina

Medina is the second most important place for Sufis after Mecca. Medina has a number of holy sites, and is the site of the Kaaba, which is not as important as the Kaaba in Mecca, but it is still a holy place for Sufis. The site of the Kaaba is also an important place for Muslims in general, as the Prophet Muhammad performed the first Hajj.

Damascus

Damascus is the third place most significant for Sufis. Damascus is the site of the Dome of the Rock, which is the most important site for Sufis because it is the site of the Kaaba. Damascene Sufis, a group of Sufis from Syria, is distinguished by their love of the Dome of the Rock.

Jerusalem

Jerusalem is the fourth most important place for Sufis, and also one of the most important sites for Muslims. Jerusalem is one of the holiest sites in Islam. It is where the Prophet Muhammad received the final revelation, and where Muslims believe he received the final revelation. It is also the site of Abraham's tomb.

","The Barkley Marathons is a foot race created by Gary Cantrell and Karl Henn, and named after a friend of Gary's, Barry Barkley (who died in 2019). This race was inspired from James Earl Ray's escape from the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in 1977 (he was in-prisoned there for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr). During his 54.5 hour escape, Earl Ray could only cover 12 miles. Cantrell thought he could have done 100 miles in this time, which gave him the idea to organise a foot race in this area.

What is a p-value in statistics?,"So how does this relate to the IPCC? fact that the ice is melting, fact that the world has a warming trend, this is two things being said.

Is this a serious question? it is probably

The IPCC, being a non-profit organization, is not supposed to be in the business of influence peddling, if they are not paid then they are not required to talk about anything.

Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t find the p-value to be a very useful concept. It’s too abstract for me to understand what it is meant to convey. It’s like the whole debate about unicorns – nobody knows what it means, its just a word.

The IPCC cherry pick their results of the IPCC’s work, not the data they use. The climate models are not perfect, and the climate models are not a substitute for the real world. The data from the real world is what the IPCC is trying to ascertain. The data from the real world is what the results are based on.

By contrast, the IPCC is making a series of claims about the climate models, based on their results. The IPCC is making a series of claims about the data from the real world, based on the results of the IPCC’s work.

So the IPCC is cherry picking the results from the IPCC’s work into the results from the real world, and making claims about the real world based on those results.

The p-value is a useful concept in science, and people who have a scientific training can use it. It helps to understand what is really being measured, and what the error bars are.

But the p-value is not a useful concept in climate science. It’s not a useful concept because it doesn’t measure anything. It’s a useful concept in science because it makes it easy to understand what is being measured, what the error bars are, and what the confidence interval is.

It’s the same as saying “Can I have a hug?”

So the IPCC cherry picks their results from their work, and then makes a series of claims about the results of the work.

I don’t think anything is ever explicitly stated in the rules of the IPCC. But the IPCC’s work is basically a series of claims about the results of other people’s work.

So the IPCC","In statistics, a p-value is used to test the significance of the hypothesis. It indicates the probability that the results were obtained by chance alone. A small p-value indicates that it is very unlikely that the observed result came about by chance. 
However, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial. Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis.",0.688963,0.99878,9.568413,0.976654,0.748578,2.596278,-4.71132755279541

"From the passage provided, extract the entities which bestowed an award on Jensen Huang."," is the most egregious offender in this regard.

In the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of big companies have been forced to retrench. And the most spectacular was Tesla. The company’s founder, Elon Musk, had shrewdly realized that the business of the future would be in electric vehicles. He began to make them and to sell them. He sold some early ones, but then the company’s fate seemed to depend entirely on its ability to get the price of electric cars down to rock bottom.

At that point, he came up with a radical idea. He would make the solar panels that were needed to power the cars. A high-tech solar panel factory was built near the company’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California. It was a huge idea, and it’s one that’s now being scaled back.

In a way, this was the first test of the idea that the coronavirus crisis may be revealing a new age of corporate disinvestment. “Corporate America has been sitting on its hands for the past six months, and now we’re seeing it get back into business,” said Jeremy Grantham, a financial analyst and the founder of Grantham Capital Management, a financial advisory firm. “The coronavirus will be a wake-up call for many, as they come to terms with the fact that they’ve been sitting on the sidelines for too long.”

But there is more to this than meets the eye. It is a story of corporate behavior that is more than a little reminiscent of the Great Depression.

In the old days, companies had a lot of choices: They could go out and find new markets, or they could find their own customers. Companies like General Motors or Chrysler were able to go out and buy a lot of cars from Toyota, or they could make them themselves. But for Tesla, it was a different story. “It’s a very tough business,” said John L. Naisbitt, the author of “Tesla and the Rise of the Robots,” who is a professor of management at Duke University. “A lot of companies have been trying to do this.”

Tesla had a large number of shareholders, but none of them was willing to give the company a certain amount of money for exchange. Then came the pandemic. “If Tesla had not been able to get the price down so low, it would have been a very different story,” Professor","Jensen Huang received awards from: 1) Ernst & Young, 2) Fabless Semiconductor Association, 3) EY (Ernst & Young), 4) University of Southern California, 5) Oregon State University, 6) Harvard Business Review, 7) Eurostars AutomotiveNewsEurope, 8) National Taiwan University, 9) Semiconductor Industry Association, 10) Time magazine.",0.154239,0.996939,9.395426,0.987613,0.133871,2.333618,-3.9591188430786133

Oh the first time I came across the NASA story on the moon, it was in 1962, and it was a little different from the account we have today. Just a few years later, the first book on the moon, When Worlds Collide, was published, and in the following years I was reading a lot of books on the moon. This is a great list of Notable Books on the Moon, and ever since, I’ve been reading books on the moon whenever I can.

When Worlds Collide by Arthur C. Clarke","Buzz Aldrin, the second person to step onto the Moon's surface after Neil Armstrong, had a unique experience during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Like Armstrong, Aldrin spent just over two hours outside the lunar module, conducting experiments and collecting samples.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was both exhilarating and challenging. He described the lunar landscape as ""magnificent desolation,"" with vast, barren plains and towering mountains in the distance. Aldrin also noted the difficulty of moving around in the bulky spacesuit and the constant hissing sound of his oxygen supply.

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration. He, along with Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 team, pushed the boundaries of what was possible and opened up new frontiers for science and discovery. Aldrin's dedication to science and exploration continue to inspire future generations of astronauts and scientists.",0.062086,0.90748,10.541242,0.871285,0.051913,2.486801,-4.462101936340332

Who was Thales?,"ius of Tyre, uncredited

Retiring from public life, Philetus, the son of Hecate, was able to free himself from the obligations of his high office. He had carefully selected the king's favourite, Thales, as the new archon, and he was able to console himself with the thought that he was not depriving the king of his favourite son.

Philetus then set about recruiting the best possible team of assistants, and he was not disappointed. The first of his advisers was Thales's friend, Dionysius, the leading architect of Athens. This man was so skilful and so ambitious that he was able to persuade the king that he had won the right to become the archon's deputy. In this way, he was able to benefit from the archon's patronage, and he was able to persuade the archon that he was his best assistant.

The king's duty was to provide for his subjects, and he was pleased that the city had such a promising leader. His greatest joy, however, was to name Dionysius as his advisor; he was in a position to take the reins of government from the archon and he was confident that he had done so.

The personal relationship between the king and his advisors was another matter. He had to be able to depend on them, and they had to be able to rely on him. The king had to be willing to share his secrets with his private advisers, and he had to be able to rely on them.

The king's relationships with his advisors were vital to his power. He was dependent on their advice, and they were dependent on him. They had to be able to trust him.

**Philetus, the son of Hecate**

Hecate was the goddess of the night, who was in charge of the underworld and the souls of the dead. As such, she was a powerful and dangerous figure. She was also a powerful mother, and she was able to influence people and shape their destinies.

Some time ago, I was working for a company that was looking for a new job. I was being interviewed by the new company. My interviewer was a nice guy, so I was a little nervous. The interviewer asked me what I knew about the company. I told him about the industry I was familiar with and the company I worked for. He asked what I thought of it. I told him I thought it was a great company and I had good friends there. He then asked me what was my opinion of the industry I worked in.

I said I thought it was a great industry, but I thought there were some companies in it that were doing a lot of things right, but there were also companies in that industry that were doing a lot of things wrong. He asked me what I thought was wrong. I said a lot of the companies were doing things like buying expensive equipment, and putting it in the field, which was a waste of money, and they were not using it very well, and all the while, the equipment was sitting in the field, which was wasting money, and not being used when it should have been. He said, ""That's the way it is with most industries. There are a lot of companies that are doing things wrong, but there are also a lot of companies that are doing things right. Some people make bad decisions, and some managers make great decisions, and you need to figure out who is making the right decision, and who is making the wrong decisions, and you need to figure out what to do.""

Salesforce, to date, has managed its growth very well. Despite growing to 17000 employees, Salesforce managed to retain its core culture. It also responded to external challenges, especially against the competition, as Salesforce today competes in the CRM industry and emerged as a viable alternative to AWS. Salesforce relies more heavily on bureaucratic control mechanisms than clan and market control. Salesforce divided itself into functional units, namely, Product, Customer, People, Strategy, and Revenue. It does have some core focus areas, like the public sector as an industry vertical. Even though Salesforce, when viewed through a rational lens, is a bureaucratic organization, it is designed for flexibility, i.e, organic design. The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management.

What were Ansel Adams key achievements?," Ansel Adams is considered to be one of the most important photographers of the 20th century. His work was a catalyst for the movement in photography. His entire career was a quest to find the essence of the American landscape. He travelled from the California coast to the Yukon, and from the northernmost edge of America to the southernmost tip of Alaska, making more than 1,000 photographs. His photographs were made possible by the invention of the 35mm film camera, the advent of the motorcar and the personal camera. Adams was one of the first photographers to photograph the American landscape from a human perspective, which made his work more compelling. Adams was an accomplished photographer, cameraman (he shot many of his own photographs), teacher and writer. In addition, Adams was a director, cinematographer and editor. Fellow photographers of Adams included Helen Levitt, Robert Frank, Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, Edward Curtis and Neal Boen-ger. Adams is renowned for his ability to capture the essence of a place, and his ability to draw us into that place. The photographs that Adams made are iconic. They are not only beautiful to look at but they are timeless.

Adams was born in 1867 in Adamsville, California. His father was a photographer. His mother, a teacher, encouraged her son to take up photography. After leaving school, Adams joined the Sierra Club, where he learned to climb and photograph. His first photographs were of Yosemite in 1890. He was used to travelling by stagecoach, but his first motorcar was a gift from an admirer. He bought a camera, and began to travel around the West. He was soon joined by his brother Norman, who also became a photographer. Adams first photographed Yosemite. Later he explored the northern reaches of Alaska, and his photographs of the Yukon were praised by Ernest Thompson Seton as being the best in the world. His photographs were an inspiration to photographers in Europe. In 1907, Adams married his third wife, Helen Levitt. He was involved in the San Francisco Arts and Crafts movement, and was known as a collector of Indian arts. In 1928, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He died in 1941. Adams is widely admired, and his photographs are found in over 500 collections. In 2003, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, opened a wonderful exhibition, ‘Ansel Adams: The Search for Land’ that was inspired by Adams’ search for the",Ansel Adams was a famous landscape photographer and environmentalist.

You can’t keep a good owl down. That’s the lesson from a new study by a team of scientists who found that owls can adjust their diet and behavior to adapt to changes in their environment. The study, published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also found that individual owls can exhibit remarkable individual differences in diet and behavior, and that these differences can persist for up to 3 years.

There’s a lot of talk about the need to transition away from fossil fuels. It’s probably fair to say that the world is moving in that direction—and it’s happening fast.

In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration recently reported that consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel fell 2.5 percent in April. That’s the second straight month of declining consumption.

Energy analyst Michael Webber of the Energy Information Administration says that a new wrinkle has emerged in the U.S. electricity market.

“The industry has been in a spot of trouble for the last few years,” Webber says. “The reason why is that lots of coal-fired power plants in the U.S. are cutting back on their output, and it’s been a big contributor to the high prices at the gas pump.

What did Britain swap Havana for with Spain in 1763,".

The Royal Navy was still in its infancy, but it had already become a key part of the British economy. The Royal Navy was responsible for the security of British shores, protecting British shipping, and controlling the seas. The Royal Navy was also responsible for a number of direct British trade interests. These included the protection of British colonies from foreign attacks and the transportation of raw materials, especially sugar and molasses, across the world. The Royal Navy was also in charge of the British merchant marine. This included governing the number of ships and sailors that were allowed to sail and where those ships and sailors could sail. The Royal Navy was also responsible for ensuring that the British Empire was able to trade with other European powers, including the Americas.

The Royal Navy was the largest military entity in the British Empire, and the largest employer of the British Empire. The Royal Navy also had a military role in the American Revolutionary War, helping to protect British interests in the American colonies. In 1775, the Royal Navy was able to muster a fleet of over 7,600 men and 13 ships.

British trade was not solely done by the Royal Navy—there were other British trading industries that were also vital to the British economy. These included the British East India Company which was responsible for the trade of the British Empire. The British East India Company was the largest trading company in the world and was responsible for the trade of tea, silk, spices, and tea. There were also a number of smaller trading companies in the British Empire that were responsible for the trade of tea, sugar, and molasses.

The Royal Navy played a vital role in the British economy. However, the Royal Navy did not control all of the British economy. There were a number of other British economic interests that were also managed by the British government. These included the British East India Company, the British West India Company, and the British Colonial Trade.

CURE Algorithm is a Text Categorization Algorithm. It is a text categorization algorithm which can classify text into different categories. The algorithm is based on the concept of distance between text and category. In simple words, it means that the distance between text and category is very small and the text with smaller distance can be assigned to a category. If the distance is large between the text and the category, the text can be assigned to another category. This is called as categorization.

CURE Algorithm is an algorithm to categorize text into different categories. It is based on the concept of distance between text and category. The distance between the text and the category is very small. The text assigned to the category is very close to the text assigned to the category. The text assigned to the category is very far from the text assigned to the category. If the distance is large between the text and the category, the text can be assigned to another category. This is called as categorization.

The main technique to categorize the text is based on the concept of distance between the text and the category. The distance between the text and the category is very small. The text assigned to the category is very close to the text assigned to the category. The text assigned to the category is very far from the text assigned to the category. It is very easy to categorize the text when the distance between the text and the category is very small.

CURE uses a hierarchical clustering method that selects a middle ground between the centroid based and all point extremes in order to avoid the issues with non-uniformly sized or formed clusters.
2. In CURE, a fixed number c of evenly spaced-out points from a cluster are selected, and they are shrunk by a fraction in the direction of the cluster centroid.
3. The scattered points that have shrunk are used as cluster representatives.
4. At each stage of the hierarchical clustering algorithm used by CURE, the clusters with the closest pair of representatives are the clusters that are combined.
5. This makes CURE less sensitive to outliers and allows it to appropriately detect the clusters.",0.796979,0.986835,24.365148,0.998707,0.816181,5.59277,-5.612242698669434

Perpetual software pricing models, also known as perpetual licensing models, allow the software to be purchased for a one-time fee.  Typically the buyer has nearly unlimited use of the software in perpetuity.  If updates to the software are required, a separate software maintenance package may be purchased.

Subscription software allows unlimited use of the software for a predetermined period, often 1 year or 3 years, for a price.  Updates to the software are often included in the price of the subscription.  At the end of the subscription term, the buyer usually has the option to renew their subscription.

Consumption-based software allows the buyer to pay for their actual usage of the software during a period of time, for example monthly.  In this type of arrangement, the actual usage can vary from period to period, resulting in customer charges that vary as well.

Martin has described his series as a continuation of the novels A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings, after the first four novels, Martin intended to finish the series with two more books before stopping and returning to other projects. Martin first began writing the first book of the series, A Game of Thrones, in 1986, when the series was still in its early stages, Martin was working as a writer, editor, and literary agent for another publishing house known as Titan Books. For a time, Martin was the editor of that company, having been hired to replace Martin as editor in chief of Titan Books. Martin was also working on his first novel, The Gunslinger.

"Based on this passage about Ted Kennedy, at the time of his death, who were the three longest-serving senators of all time?","

In one of the typical examples of the media's tendency to over-focus on the trivial, a few days ago the New York Times reported that Sen. Joe Lieberman, who is leaving the Senate at the end of this year, did not attend a Senate White House Correspondents dinner because he was attending his son's high school graduation. The story goes on to say that the event was a ""celebrity event,"" implying that it was a big deal. It wasn't.

The true story is that Joe and his family decided to skip the dinner because his son, Patrick, was graduating from a different high school. The event was not a ""celebrity event"" so much as it was Joe's annual tradition of taking his son out for dinner on his birthday.

As it turns out, Patrick was getting his award at the dinner, which is why his father was there. It wasn't a big deal.

The passage from the book that I cited earlier, Justice Kennedy's dissent in Bush v. Gore, is one that I find very interesting. It is a very interesting statement of principle, but it is also very timely.

Justice Kennedy makes the point that the Supreme Court may not rule on the constitutionality of a law, but it can decide whether or not to uphold it. He makes the point that the court may decide to do so in a case where the procedural rules seem to be on the side of the law yet the court is not convinced that the law is constitutional, even though the procedural rules are.

The process by which this happens is that the court sends the case back to the lower court to have additional proceedings. The court may order that the law be enforced, but it is not required to do so. It is, in effect, the court's way of saying, ""I'm not going to rule on the constitutionality of this law, but I'm going to tell you what the lower court can do to resolve the matter.""

In the case of Bush v. Gore, the court remanded the case back to the lower court with instructions to allow the record to be developed. It is the Supreme Court's way of saying, ""We're not going to rule on the constitutionality of the law, but we're going to tell you what the lower court needs to do to resolve the matter.""

What does this mean for the case of Citizens United v. FEC? Well, the court has already entered a ruling on the constitution","Based on this passage, Robert Byrd, Strom Thurmond and Kennedy were the three longest-serving senators of all time.",0.559747,0.756214,2.249368,0.855505,0.632042,1.010575,-3.9026525020599365

The `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event is very similar to `ListBoxItemClick` and it also has the same parameters. This event allows the mouse to be clicked on the selected list item. The `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event works in the same way as `ListBoxItemClick` but it works differently. When the mouse is clicked on the selected list item, the `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event will be called. The `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event also has the `SelectedItem` parameter. The `SelectedItem` parameter tells the event that which item was clicked.

Add the `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event to the `ListBox` event as shown in Figure 20.24.

**Figure 20.24** Add the `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event to the `ListBox` event.

Add the event handler function to the `ListBoxItemMouseClick` event like so:

How to make a dish thicken fast without adding cream or starch?

I have a recipe that calls for a cup of flour to thicken the sauce, and I don't want to use cream and starch. Do you have any suggestions?

I have a recipe that calls for a cup of flour to thicken the sauce, and I don't want to use cream and starch. Do you have any suggestions?

Answer:

You can use cornstarch or potato starch. You can add the starch (and the flour) to the sauce. The sauce will thicken up and the flour will become lighter in color. This is also an important step in making a sauce that will thicken up quickly.

You can also add 1/2 cup of water to the sauce. This is especially helpful when making a sauce that is already thick. Water will become completely absorbed by the starch. The sauce will thicken up and become creamy.

You can also add a little bit of chicken stock. The sauce will thicken up, but not as much as if you use just water. The sauce will become creamy, but with a bit of a thin texture.

You can also add a little bit of cream. The sauce will thicken up, but not as much as if you use just water. The sauce will become creamy, but with a bit of a thin texture.

What causes global warming?,"us, melaleuca, and aloe-series A. Long-term changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have been estimated to have caused an average global temperature change of around 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit (0.1 degrees Celsius) since the last ice age, said Jim McGill, a climatologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. However, the average global temperature change since the onset of the industrial revolution about 1750 is 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.4 degrees Celsius), he said.Scientific consensus on the cause of global warming is based on an analysis of the world's climate data by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, released in September 2007, concluded that at least 95% of the rise in global average temperature since the late 20th century was ""very likely"" due to human activity. The IPCC also estimated that the Earth's average temperature is now rising about 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) due to human-induced increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other pollutants.The IPCC's assessment is based largely on the work of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and relies on the output of thousands of scientists worldwide. However, the IPCC's methods could be criticized because it did not include the views of more than 90% of the world's climate scientists, an analysis by the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental Studies found.The IPCC's projections have been criticized by independent scientists. They say that the IPCC's estimates of future global temperature trends have been heavily influenced by a ""cherry-picking"" of data that support the view that human activity is causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The scientists say that the IPCC has ignored significant data that indicate the effects of natural climate variability. The IPCC's projections also have been criticized for not including other natural factors that could influence temperature change.The IPCC's projections have also been criticized for not taking into account the effects of recent climate change, which could make future predictions more difficult. For example, the IPCC's projections assume that the amount of nuclear power plant emissions will be pretty constant over the next few decades. However, recent policy changes have restricted the amount of nuclear power that is permitted in the United States and elsewhere. The United States is the world's largest producer of nuclear power, and its administration has also been criticized","Global warming is caused by the release of greenhouses gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap the heat from the sun and lead to an overall increase in temperature on the planet. Greenhouse gases are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Deforestation is also a contributing factor to global warming since trees capture carbon from the atmosphere when growing, so cutting them down or burning them both releases carbon they’ve been storing, as well as removes their ability to clean the air.",0.002991,0.071907,8.601509,0.098061,0.002252,1.755344,-2.8222455978393555
"my health insurance covers preventative procedures like vaccines 100%. But I know some health care providers charge a ""visit fee"" in addition to the vaccine fee. What's the difference between getting a vaccine in a clinic and a pharmacy? Will getting a vaccine in a clinic (such as minute clinics) result in charges?","!

A:

I'm not sure if this is helpful to your question, but in general, in the US, pharmacies are considered to be ""regular"" stores. Pharmacy visits are usually free, but there are other fees associated with your visit.
In particular, pharmacies are not allowed to sell over the counter drugs to people without a proper prescription. So, if you buy a prescription in a pharmacy, you do not need to pay a visit fee. However, if you go to a pharmacy to buy a prescription, you do need to pay a visit fee, usually around $25 for a one-time fee, or around $2 to $3 per prescription. 
The reason for this is that pharmacies have to maintain a certain level of inventory in order to be able to fill prescriptions.
The reason for having a visit fee is because pharmacies are not able to bill insurance companies (typically Medicare, Medicaid, and/or private insurance companies). So, if you go to a pharmacy for a prescription, the pharmacist will fill the prescription (typically they do not provide any additional services, such as immunizations, but they fill the prescription), and then they will bill insurance companies, as they are considered to be ""regular"" stores.
However, if you go to a pharmacy to buy a prescription, the pharmacist will usually write your prescription for you, and then you will be able to get a date for your next visit to the pharmacy. You only need to pay the visit fee if you go to the pharmacy to buy the prescription.
If you go to a pharmacy, you will need to pay a visit fee, and then must wait a specified amount of time for your prescription to be filled. This amount of time is typically about 20 minutes, which is why you typically need to pay a visit fee if you buy a prescription in a pharmacy.
You can also buy a prescription over the counter at a pharmacy. However, if you buy a prescription without a visit fee, you must wait a specified amount of time in order to get your prescription filled. This amount of time is typically about 1 hour, which is why you typically need to pay a visit fee if you buy a prescription in a pharmacy.
When you do need to pay a visit fee, typically they have a ""pay by mail"" option, where you pay the visit fee in advance, and then receive the prescription. If you do not pay the visit fee, you will never receive the prescription.

","The main difference between getting a vaccine at a clinic and a pharmacy comes down to the setting and the potential fees involved.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.

When we moved to London, Ontario, in the fall of 2015, we thought we would be able to ride the bus everywhere we needed to go. After all, since we were only living a few hours away from the bus depot, why wouldn't we have a bus pass?
The problem was that the TTC in London didn't have a pass for adults.
In January of 2016, we decided that we were going to have to start looking for a new mode of transportation.

We researched public transportation, but it was not something that we had been able to use in the past. It turns out that, before we moved to London, we did not have a car. We were renting an apartment in the city, but we did not own a vehicle.
After some research, we discovered that we could get a bus pass from the TTC, but they would be less than one per month.

We decided to buy a bus pass from the TTC. It was a little more expensive, but we figured we'd use it for a while and save it for the next time we need it.
We have been using the bus pass for almost a year now. It has been a great asset to our lifestyle and has led to many new and exciting adventures.

We did have to learn a little bit about the bus system in London. There are a few different routes that we can take to get to work, and we have to stay in …

As a sport, skateboarding has always had a special attitude towards rules and pushed boundaries. Think of where one is supposed to skate (in the park) and where the best spots can actually be found across town (particularly where it's forbidden). In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved. As humbling and painful as falling onto plain asphalt can be, it can also stimulate resilience and a relieving patience when the goal is in sight.

He is, however, mentioned in Poe's biography that was published in 1904. Poe was born on February 23, 1809, in Richmond, Virginia. He was raised in a poor family, and had to work hard to help support his family. He worked at a mill, and later as a printer and a lawyer. He was also a teacher, and worked as a private tutor. Poe was passionate about art, and he won a prize for his poetry. He married in 1837, and they had two children. In 1844, Poe moved to the University of Virginia, where he worked on a law degree for a few years. He then decided to pursue a medical degree, and in 1847, he was accepted into the school. He dropped out of medical school after one year, and he then moved to New York, where he worked as a freelance writer. He began writing detective stories, and worked at the New York Herald. The New York Herald was owned by the New York Sun. Poe was also a friend of William Lloyd Garrison, and a supporter of Garrison's fight against slavery.

Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?,"ation on the Internet.

It's a question that divides the Internet.

In one corner, you've got the guys in the deli who say tomato is a fruit and not a vegetable. In the other, you've got the vegetarians.

""Some people say they're fruits, some people say they're vegetables,"" says Jeff Johnson, co-founder of the Vegetarian Society of North America.

Johnson says there's no problem with tomatoes because they're not fleshy or full of blood. He says you can look at a tomato and tell it's not a vegetable.

""But it's a fruit. It's an edible fruit, but not a vegetable.""

He says the debate is mostly over semantics.

""There's no nutritional difference between a tomato and a carrot,"" he says. ""So, for the purposes of nutrition, a tomato and a carrot are the same.""

After all, he says, ""they're both edible fruits.""

You might think that being an edible fruit would be enough to make a tomato a vegetable. But even though vegetables don't require flesh, they do need the nutrients that come from a tomato.

""Tomatoes are really good sources of vitamin C,"" Johnson says. ""They're good sources of lycopene, which protects the skin from the sun and also helps prevent tumor formation.""

But the debate has been going on for a long time, and it goes back to a time when tomatoes were believed to be the food of the gods.

""They're the fruit of the sun,"" says Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent for CNN.

""It's the fruit of the heavens. You could say tomatoes are the fruit of the gods. And they were considered so powerful that they didn't need to be cultivated.""

But tomatoes aren't the only fruit that has a complicated relationship with food.

""Bananas are not vegetables,"" Gupta says. ""They're fruits. And you can eat them. They're not vegetables.""

Gupta says bananas can get a bad rap because of their association with obesity. But he says they're actually not a bad source of calories.

""The calories in a banana are very similar to the calories in a potato, which is one of the most popular foods in North America,"" he says.

Gupta says we don't really know why some fruits are considered vegetables and others aren't",Tomatoes are fruits because they form from a flower and contain seeds.,0.017989,0.978287,27.546384,0.732848,0.011312,5.857364,-5.332540035247803

What is the difference between bikepacking and bicycle touring?," et al.

What is the difference between bikepacking and bicycle touring?

There are several similarities between bikepacking and bike touring, such as their travelling in groups, their use of the bicycle for transportation, the types of terrain they cover, and the level of comfort they require. However, they are very different in many other ways.

Bikepacking is a way of using the bicycle for transportation. It involves carrying your own essential gear and supplies, but you leave your bike in a parking garage or on a rack in a parking lot.

Bike touring is a way of using the bicycle for transportation. It involves carrying baggage, but you leave your bike in a parking garage or on a rack in a parking lot.

As you might imagine, bikepacking and bike touring are quite different from each other. In fact, I don’t think there are any significant similarities at all.

What are the similarities between bikepacking and bike touring?

The ways in which they are similar to each other are twofold:

Both are very leisurely. Bikepacking is done over a few days or weeks, while bike touring is done over a few weeks or months. Both are social and often involve a lot of talking about what you’re going to do, where you’re going, and why you’re going there.

Both are a bit of a gamble. Bikepacking and bike touring both involve a substantial amount of risk in terms of having to carry your own gear and supplies or in having to carry the weight of your bike.

What are the differences between bikepacking and bike touring?

The differences between bikepacking and bike touring are quite substantial.

Bikepacking involves carrying your own gear and supplies. It is a way of doing bicycle touring, but it is not a way of doing bicycle touring.

Bike touring involves carrying your own gear and supplies. It is a way of doing bicycle touring, but it is not a way of doing bikepacking.

Melanochromis simulans has a fairly distinctive appearance and is easily identified by its large dark blue eyes, golden-yellow dorsal and anal fins, and white belly. It is one of the most common fish in the waters of eastern North America.

Eastern snook are plankton feeders that spend most of their time in the surface layer of the water column where they feed on plankton and smaller prey items. Like many other fishes they are capable of chemical communication.

Eastern snook can be found in almost every river in eastern North America, the Pacific Coast of the United States, and the northeast Atlantic coast of the United States.

The eastern snook is a very adaptable species, ranging in size from 4 to 15 inches. It has a single dorsal fin, large eyes, and a bright yellow belly. This fish is found in the Northeast Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Maine.

The basking sharks are a marine fish. They are aplacental viviparous, which means they are born alive and give birth to live young. They give birth to live young every four years.

Their young are born alive and stay in the water for three to five days. They are able to move and feed by themselves after three days, which allows them to stay in the water for an additional seven to 10 days.

Why is backcountry skiing fun?,"il, Utah, USA

In the early 2000s, the American Backpacker magazine declared that, “Backcountry skiing is the new best thing going.” The word “backcountry” is a Scandinavian word that means “remote destination” and, since the 1980s, skiing has been a popular destination for travelers. As a result, it has become the fastest growing winter sport in the United States and Europe. Backcountry skiing became popular because of its variety, fun, and enjoyment. A person can get out on the mountain and ski for a full day or two, depending on the conditions.

Backcountry skiing is a combination of skiing, hiking, and mountain biking. There are a lot of different types of skiing used in backcountry. There are route skis, alpine skis, snowboards, snowshoes, and snowmobiles. Route skis are flexible and maneuverable, which makes it easy for people to get around in the backcountry. Alpine skis are similar to route skis, but they are more rigid. Alpine skis are used for longer, more serious excursions. Snowboards, snowshoes, and snowmobiles are used for terrain and travel that is too steep, rough, or slick to be skied.

As a traveler, you will want to learn the equipment that is available to you in the United States. Staying at a nice hotel and getting a room with a fireplace are nice for a relaxing evening, but if you have to stay in a bare room, you will probably choose a hotel with a fireplace. The same holds true for the gear. If you plan to use a snowboard, snowshoes, or snowmobiles, you will want to know what types are available in your area. The equipment is available in the United States and is available at ski shops, ski rental shops, and on the Internet. All of the gear is available in many different sizes and prices.

Skiing is a popular winter sport for travel. It is a great way to get out and enjoy nature and the scenery. The equipment is available for purchase in many different sizes and prices. A snowboard, snowshoes, and snowmobiles are a great way to enjoy the terrain and scenery. When you are in the mountains, you should be able to use whatever it takes to enjoy the sport and scenery and to stay warm.

Who won the WNBA championship in 2018?," 2018

WASHINGTON. - Former Washington Mystics head coach Mike Thibault announced on Wednesday that he is stepping down as head coach. Thibault, who led the Mystics to their first WNBA championship in 2018, will continue to serve as an assistant coach on the team.

The former Olympian and coach of the U.S. national team is retiring after seven seasons with the Mystics. Thibault also served as the head coach at the University of Maryland and the University of Cincinnati.

""I'm grateful for the opportunity to coach the Washington Mystics and to be a part of the team's journey,"" Thibault said in a statement released by the franchise. ""I would like to thank the Washington Mystics and the WNBA for the opportunity to come back here and lead this team and to continue to make the Mystics a part of the WNBA's fabric. My family, who I love dearly, have been with me through this journey. I will always be grateful to them for their love and support. I also want to thank my wonderful wife, Pam, and my three children for their love and support. I've been blessed with a great group of young players and the next chapter of the Washington Mystics will be exciting. I look forward to seeing them grow together.""

Thibault was a key part of the Mystics' 2018 championship team, helping the team to a 50-32 record and a 16-6 record in the postseason. The Mystics were the first team in league history to reach the WNBA Finals.

""There's no question, I think Mike is a great coach who has made an impact on this franchise,"" Washington Mystics president and general manager Kim Mulkey said. ""I think he's done a great job, and I know we have a lot of respect for him as a person and as a coach, and we wish him the best as he moves on to the next chapter of his life.""

Thibault was hired by the Mystics in 2017 after leading Cincinnati to the WNBA championship in 2016. He was named the WNBA Coach of the Year in 2017 after helping the Mystics to a 30-8 record through the regular season. Thibault guided the Mystics to the first-ever WNBA championship in 2018.

Give me a bulleted list of Aaron Fenster's accomplishments.,".

I have to say, I was disappointed with this episode. As much as I loved the first two, this one was just off. First of all, Aaron was looking a little peaky and had a little trouble keeping his eyes open when he tried to read a book (which was even more evident when he looked to the left and right each time a page was read). Secondly, it seemed like we were going to be seeing a lot more about the book, but not that much. I was hoping that Aaron would end up reading a really long passage of the book, and then we would later see him and his sister going to the town to find the book, or something. It was a little bit disappointing.

I loved Aaron's reaction to seeing the book, and I thought it was funny that when he put the book away for a second, the librarian asked him if he was ""just going to pretend to look at it?"" I also thought that Aaron's reaction to seeing his sister was funny. I was expecting to see him frowning or something, but he just smiled and smiled.

Aaron's sister is in a ""mood"" and I really hope that she doesn't get what I'm talking about with this episode. I liked the fact that her clothes weren't all matching, showing us that she's not as perfect as she thinks she is. Also, I was a little disappointed when Aaron's sister was talking to a girl, but she just ignored her and kept talking to Aaron. I was hoping that she would come to Aaron with some advice, but she didn't. I liked how she was testing Aaron to see if he would go with her. I was also glad that she didn't get mad at Aaron for asking her questions. That would have been kind of annoying.

I was surprised that Aaron was the one who was reading the book, since I thought it was going to be his sister. I don't know. I just thought that it would be funny to see him reading the book, and then realizing that he was the one who was reading it, but I guess I was just surprised by that.

I really liked Aaron's reaction to the librarian. He was just so cute. I was really surprised that Aaron and his sister were going to the town of the book. I wasn't expecting that at all. I was excited to see them, and I really hope they make it through all the books.

I thought that Aaron's sister","- Medical physicist at the University of Western Ontario Robarts Research Institute.

How is it that some high net-worth individuals are able to avoid paying taxes completely?," is a wealthy individual who has never had to pay income taxes.

For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all.",0.264047,0.949983,28.560749,0.991414,0.238471,6.200933,-4.833634376525879
How is the white color created?,": After the particles have been accelerated to high velocities, there is a brief period of deceleration to form a shock front. The high-energy particles that are directed away from the shock front are then reflected off the shock front and are focused into a cone of high-energy radiation. The shock front also accelerates the electrons and positrons and the high-energy particles that are directed toward the shock front are then again reflected off the shock front and are focused into a cone of high-energy radiation. The electrons and positrons are the primary radiating particles. Therefore, the high-energy radiation is produced by the electrons and positrons. Since the electrons are moving very fast, they emit at nearly the speed of light, about 0.99992 c.

Why are there no other visible high-energy radiation sources? The other radiating particles are too low in energy to produce visible radiation.

Why are there no other visible high-energy radiation sources? The particles that are produced by the accelerator are very quickly accelerated to very high energies, in a fraction of a picosecond. These particles are also very high in mass. Since they are so heavy and have such high energies, they are essentially massless. Therefore, they cannot be seen to be accelerated.

The diagram shows the high-energy particles accelerated to high velocities and directed into a cone of high-energy radiation.

What happens to the high-energy particles after they are accelerated to high energies? These high-energy particles are then accelerated to even higher velocities, and then are directed into a cone of high-energy radiation.

Why are there no other visible high-energy radiation sources? The high-energy particles are so high in energy and have such high velocities that they cannot be seen to be accelerated.

This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

In the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity. This creates a pure white color on electronic displays.",0.897453,0.997884,11.267864,0.999465,0.961902,3.024914,-4.410256862640381

"From the passage provided, extract which companies are local to Seattle which led to its development. Separate them with a comma.",", for example, is an English company, so the full form would be

""This is a study of the English companies which have led to Seattle's development.""

Now you have a list, but you don't know what the full form is.

So it's no big deal if you don't know the full form. But what is the full form? It's the subject of the sentence, and the subject must be a person or a location. So answer your question, ""What is the full form of an English company?"" with, ""This is an English company.""

How would you answer, ""This is a study of companies which led to Seattle's development.""?

I don't know the full form of a company. My statement is that the companies did not lead to development.

The companies did not lead to the development of Seattle.

There's a difference, and you need to be careful.

The companies may not have led to the development of Seattle, but they did lead to the development of the city's economy.

If the subject is a company, the subject must be a person or a location, right? So answering the question ""What is the full form of an English company?"" with, ""This is an English company"" probably makes sense. But answer the sentence, ""This is a study of the English companies which led to Seattle's development,"" with your answer to the question, ""What is the full form of an English company?"" You can't answer the question with ""This is an English company"" because a company is not an English company.

Forming the Subject

In most cases, you can answer the question ""What is the subject of the sentence?"" with the subject's name. But it's important to know that there are exceptions to this.

Subjects are usually named, but if you can't, you can use a pronoun.

"Tell me whether these are cats or dogs: French Bulldogs, Ragdoll, British Shorthair, Labrador, Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Maine Coon, Poodles, Bulldogs, Persian, Rottweilers, Devon Rex, Beagles.",". The cat was lying on his back, his head on his paws. He had his forearms against his belly, and his paws looked they were wrapped in black gauze. He had some blood on his nose, but it wasn't a lot.

I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. I didn't know what to do. I looked at the dog, wondering what it was doing there. I wondered if it had been hit by a car.

This is an example of a person with color blindness.

We have seen that color blindness is a variation of color vision. We've also seen that color vision is a type of color perception. Here is a list of other types of color perception:

Males are more likely to be color blind than females, because the genes responsible for the same are present on the X chromosome. Females who are non-color blind could still carry and pass on genes for color blindness. Any kind of physical or chemical damage to the eye, optic nerve or brain could also lead to the same.

There is no cure for color blindness. Affected people can actively accommodate the condition or use special glasses or lenses that can help people with red-green color blindness to a certain extent.

"Classify each of these items as footwear or headwear: wool hat, snowshoes, baseball hat, bicycle helmet, skis, flippers, and flip flops."," can also differentiate the items as standard or special use, and can also make distinctions between items with and without laces. Despite these gaps, we believe the FD and Classification guidelines can provide a useful starting point for classifying a wide range of items.

The FD is a useful resource for evaluating how items are used, but it does not indicate whether the item is worn on the body. To determine whether an item is wearable, the FD must be supplemented by other information such as manufacturer and retailer information, stylistic information, or any other information that may shed light on how the item is used. For example, a baseball cap may be considered a headwear item if the manufacturer or retailer indicates that the item is headwear, but this is not a sufficient determination of wearability. The FD does not provide information on the extent to which the item is used, and it does not indicate whether or not the item is worn on the head. For these reasons, FD information alone may not be sufficient to determine if an item is wearable.

The Classification guideline provides a useful starting point for characterizing items that are worn on the body. It is not the only way to characterize items, and it is not appropriate for describing all items that are worn on the body. However, the Classification guideline can be useful for characterizing headwear, ski equipment, or other equipment that is worn on the body. As with the FD, the Classification guideline cannot be used to determine whether an item is wearable.

We recognize that the FD and Classification guidelines are not intended to be comprehensive descriptions of all items that are worn on the body. The FD and Classification guidelines do not include information on the type of fabric, the type of closure, the style of clothing, or any other important features that distinguish some items from others. However, the FD and Classification guidelines do distinguish between items that are worn on the head, on the arm, and over the torso. The FD and Classification guidelines do not provide information on the tensile strength or elasticity of the fabric, the weight of the item, or its degree of flexibility.

In addition, the FD and Classification guidelines do not provide information about the components of the item. For example, the FD does not provide information about the materials used in the headwear, the material of the skis, or the type of binding used on the bicycle. The Classification guideline does not provide information about the type of material used in the headwear, the material of the skis, or the type of binding used on","The footwear items include: snowshoes, skis, flippers and flip flops.

"Given this text about James Pressdee, tell me what sports they played, which awards they won, when they were born, and if they are still alive.",".

The village of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, England, is home to the Weston training centre and the famous Weston House Hotel.

The hotel is set to close in June, and the centre will close in September. Weston House was once the Weston golf club, but the 18-hole course was lost to development in the 1930s. It is thought that the hotel was constructed around the time that the course was lost, though the exact date is unknown.

The motoring awards are known as MotorSport.co.uk’s awards.

They were first named in 2004 by the magazine’s editor, Robin Wigglesworth. In 2006, MotorSport began their awards ceremony, with the introduction of the different awards.

The Weston awards are the oldest awards in their category, having been first presented in 2005. The awards are named after the village of Weston-super-Mare, which lies just outside the Weston golf course.

The awards are given to drivers and co-drivers of sports cars who are nominated by a member of the public via MotorSport.co.uk’s suggestion box.

They are usually given out at events, such as the Bathurst 12 Hour and the Bathurst 1000.

The awards are presented by Mike Tucker, who is the magazine’s official motorsport photographer, and Geoff Lee, who is a motorsport journalist.

There is no formal voting process involved, but the magazine’s editorial board chooses which awards are presented. The Weston awards are presented in the same manner as other awards, which are usually presented by the magazine’s editor.

The magazine has also presented awards outside of motorsport.

In 2007, it was the first time they had been presented out of motorsport. The awards were presented in the form of a quiz that was hosted by the magazine.

The quiz was hosted in the magazine’s offices at the time, and the awards were presented at the same event. The magazine’s editor, Robin Wigglesworth, was the quiz host.

The magazine has also presented awards for other forms of motorsport.

The awards are presented for both motorsport and road cars.

The magazine’s website also lists the awards as “motorsport” awards.

The awards are presented in the form of a quiz, with the questions being taken from the MotorSport","James Stuart Pressdee played both football and cricket.

How do","The easiest way is to buy a normal rug that you can cut down to size to fit your shape. Rugs made out of synthetic materials are easier to cut since they do not need special processing to stop them from getting unthreaded. You should draw an outline on the back on the rug and use a very sharp cutter to trace it. To prevent damage while cutting, you can put a regular kitchen cutting board under your work area. Finally, you can seal the edges either by singeing them, putting a bead of glue or buying adhesive rug edging tape.",0.070737,0.954704,38.517707,0.928501,0.066985,8.107727,-6.82417631149292

"Given this paragraph about kubernetes, what is the storage layer of Kubernetes control plane?","

A:

This is a great question and I am not a native English speaker. But I will try my best to answer this.
In short, the Kubernetes control plane is a system or a collection of components that makes up the control plane. It is not a software, but a set of components that are collectively responsible for the operation of the Kubernetes cluster.
Here is the description of the components of the control plane.

The control plane is a set of components that collectively
  manage the Kubernetes cluster. The components are:

Control plane manager - an application that manages and oversees the cluster.
Ingress controller - an application that manages network connectivity and load balancing in the cluster.
Scheduler - a service that manages the scheduling of pods.
Node Manager - an application that manages and oversees the cluster.
Node Agent - a service that manages the node lifecycle.
Kubelet - a service that manages the nodes that run the containers.
Resource Manager - a service that manages the cluster's resources.

You can read more about the components here.
Note that the number of components listed above is not fixed and could vary depending on the version of Kubernetes.
In the Kubernetes documentation, you can find the following image that shows the major components of the control plane.

In this image, the Node Manager and the Scheduler are shown to be the important components of the control plane.

Give me a list of luxury watches to buy," Give me a list of luxury watches to buy

A few months ago I ordered these watches from a retailer and once they arrived they were altered. The logo on the watch was changed to two watches. The back was changed to two watches only. I spoke to the retailer and they said there was no problem. They said they would return the watches. I have asked for a refund of the money I paid and I still have not received a reply. I would like to get my money back. Do you think they should return my money or is this just a mistake?

This is the first time I have ever heard of this happening. I would say they should return your money. It is not like they are sending you a very expensive watch. They should just refund your money and keep your watch if they are unhappy with it.

Posted by: Anonymous on October 25, 2014

I have a few questions for you. I bought a watch from a company that was run by two brothers. I had a problem with the watch and returned it to the company. I asked for a refund and was told that I would have to pay a shipping fee. I told them I would not pay the fee. Two days later I received a call from a representative of the company saying that they did not have the money to refund my money. I told the representative that I would call the police and the company said I had to pay the shipping fee or I would be arrested. The representative said that I should pay the fee. I asked if I could pay the fee in installments and was told that I could not. I ended up paying the $100 shipping fee plus $100. I was told by the company representative that they had the money. They were going to send me a check for the remainder of the $100. I did not receive the check and it is now over a week since I have received it. Is there anything that can be done about this?

I would say that they should refund your money. You should not have to pay a shipping fee, but if you want to file a police report you should definitely do that.

"Given this paragraph about time travel, how practical is it"," the kind of time travel that’s been assumed in the past, and whether it’s possible to do it via the wormhole?

D.Deal

The wormhole is a possible solution to the problem. But it is not the only possible solution. I have some thoughts which I will have to consider later.

I think I have a point to make. The wormhole is not the only possible way to travel back in time. For example, you have the Konigsberg Bridge. The Konigsberg Bridge is a bridge to the past. In one direction, you go under the bridge and you travel back in time. In the other direction, you go over the bridge and you come back to the present. The Konigsberg Bridge is a good example of a time machine.

When you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, the probability of you being killed is very high. If you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, you will die. For example, suppose that the Konigsberg Bridge is located in the United States. You go over the bridge. If you enter the United States, you will be killed. You will die in the United States. If you don’t enter the United States, you will be killed in Europe. You will be killed in Europe.

The Konigsberg Bridge is a good time machine. But it is not the only possible time machine. There are others. For example, the Grand Canyon, the Bering Strait, and the Sahara Desert are good time machines.

The wormhole is a type of time machine. It is not the only type of time machine, but it is the most common type of time machine and the most practical type of time machine.

I have to consider what happens if you go under the Konigsberg Bridge. If you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, you will die. If you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, you will be killed by the United States. If you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, you will be killed by the United States.

There is another way that you can go back in time. If you go under the Konigsberg Bridge, you can go back in time in one direction and you can go back in time in the other direction. We will discuss this when we talk about the wormhole.

Avoiding humorless and negative people is important to improve your mental health.

I have seen many people that are trying to help others pass the time in a negative way that increases their stress and can create anxiety.

Some people also use humor to cover up their own problems. They try to make others laugh at their problems.

You can use humor to improve your mental health and also to make yourself happier.

Humor is a great way to take you out of a bad situation that may be happening to your body. It can also help you look at things in a more positive light. Humor is a great way to escape from a bad situation, especially when you are in a bad mood.

I have heard that it is not nice to be around other people that have a negative attitude.

I don’t think that it","Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. 
Researchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of.

Why is film photography popular again?,"ation is a

Why is film photography popular again?

Film has been used for photographic
illustration and advertising since the early 20thcentury.

Film photography has become popular again
following the introduction of digital photography.

The main reasons for this trend are:

1.

Availability:Film photography is still inexpensive and easy to
obtain.

This has made it more acceptable to amateur photographers.

2.

Time: Film photography is not subject to the same
restrictions as digital photography, and so it can be taken at
any time of the day and in any location.

3.

Technique: Film photography is a low-tech,
low-cost, low-maintenance technique.

4.

Photographic
Perfection: Film photography produces results that are
frequently more accurate than digital photography.

For example, the
contrast between a film image and a digital image is often
much greater than the contrast between a digital image and its
recomposed version.

5.

Reflectivity: The reflectivity of a
photograph is often better than that of a digital image.

This means that it is easier to see the details of a
photograph than a digital image, which is why film is sometimes
referred to as a ‘crystal’ image.

One major drawback to film photography is that
it is only practical to take a photograph when the subject is in
the same position as it was when the photograph was taken.

This means that it is often necessary to move the
object being photographed when taking a photograph, which can be
frustrating for subjects.

However, film photography is still useful in
making a photograph of a moving object.

In fact, film photography can be used for
photography in situations that digital photography cannot be used
for.

For example, film photography has been
successfully used to make photographs of the moon, the sun, and
the aurora borealis.

In some cases it can be used to take pictures of
moving objects, but it is not always possible.

There are two types of film:

1.

Standard film:

Standard film is the most widely used type of film.
It is also the cheapest type of film.

Standard film is suitable for taking photographs
in bright light","Film photography had seen a long decline in popularity ever since the invention of digital cameras with their remarkable leaps in technological advances. As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in",0.00305,0.681653,20.360623,0.808068,0.002197,4.371118,-9.915403366088867

","As kids grow and have a sense of the world around them, they tend to be eager to understand the meaning of everything and events. In most cases, their primary source of information is the adults around them, usually their mom and data, hence they ask 'why' on a lot of things and events. This not only develops their intellectual skills, but also their social skills.

Choose the best bikes for riding on roads.

Everyone knows that biking is the best way to get exercise. Commuting is great for the local economy and it's even better for the environment. You can take a bike wherever you go, and it doesn't take a lot of power.

The best bikes you can buy to ride on roads are:

Bicycle-based scooters: These are lightweight, easy to pedal, and perfect for commuting and urban riding

Mountain bikes: The best bikes for riding on roads are the ones with a hardtail frame. Mountain bikes are perfect for riding on trails and even on roads.

Strollers: If you decide to use a stroller as your bike, you'll have to fold it up. A stroller is perfect for short distances, too.

Pedal-assist bikes: These are a great option if you need to be on the road for more than an hour. These bikes will get you there faster than a car, but you'll need to get them a lot healthier.

Bicycles in general: Bicycles are not the best option for long distances. If you're going to bicycle for more than an hour, bike a hybrid bike.

Lighter bicycles: If you want to be able to ride a bicycle, but don't want to get too heavy, you should buy a bike with a lightweight frame.

If you ride a bicycle, you should get a bike with a flat tire. Bikes with a flat tire are more comfortable than bikes with a tube. Bikes with tubes are just too bulky.

If you ride on a bike, you should always wear a helmet. Bikes are not the best option when you're riding at a high speed.

Please tell us if you need additional information or have a question about this item.

List the members of the Ivy in reverse alphabetical order.,": the members of the Ivy in alphabetical order.

A:

I'll answer my own question, since I can't undelete it.
The problem was that I was returning the IvyList from the forEach method. After doing so, the type of the IvyList is no longer String, but List<String>.
The solution is to return IvyList<String> from the forEach method, like so:
return IvyList.from(this.iVies)
    .map(iVie -> iVie.id)
    .toList();

A:

I think the problem is that you are returning IvyList which is not a list of String, but of Ivy, which is a class.
To solve this you need to create a method that returns an IvyList of String, something like this:
private static IvyList<String> toList() {
    final List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

    for (final Object o : this) {
        final Ivy ivy = (Ivy) o;
        list.add(String.valueOf(ivy.id));
    }

    return IvyList.from(list);
}

As you can see, the type of the IvyList is IvyList<String>

Types of social media

Social media can be categorized into four types:

1. Online social networks and forums

2. Blogs, podcasts, and wikis

3. Microblogs such as Twitter and Facebook

4. Mobile social networks

Online social networks and forums

Online social networks and forums are social media that are accessed through the Internet. These websites have been created to enable users to create a network of friends to share information and discuss topics of interest. In contrast to the offline social networks, online social networks allow users to post messages and share information. Online social networks, including discussion forums, include sites such as Facebook, Myspace, and YouTube. Many online social networks are free, and many, such as MySpace, have a paid membership that enables users to share content with their friends.

Blogs, podcasts, and wikis

Blogs are social media that are created to enable users to share information. Blogs are similar to web logs, in that they have been created to enable users to share information with others. Blogs generally have a set of entries that include topics of interest, links to other websites, and other content. Blogs are created by individuals, organizations, and companies.

Microblogs such as Twitter and Facebook

Microblogs are social media that are created to enable users to create messages and share them with others. Microblogs are similar to Twitter, but they contain fewer entries. Microblogs are created by individuals, organizations, and companies.

Mobile social networks

Mobile social networks are social media that are created to enable users to connect with others through their mobile devices. Mobile social networks are similar to mobile blogging and microblogs, but they are used to connect users with content through their mobile devices.

Mobile social networks include sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, and MySpace. These sites allow users to post messages and share content with their friends through their mobile devices.

Growing and declining social media

Facebook and Twitter have experienced rapid growth in the amount of people using social media. At the end of 2012, there were 2.2 billion users who use social media. By the end of 2013, there were 2.7 billion users who use social media. In 2012, there were 47 million people who used MySpace, which has since been surpassed by Facebook. As of 2014, there were over 2.","Social media are technologies that people interact with that enable them to share things like photos, documents, information, ideas, politics, and interests with other people.  They are a way for people to make new friends who have similar interests.  Social media is also used in dating and finding love too.  It has even been used to find talent all over the world even from under developed nations where only a camera and internet connection is needed to showcase your talent to the world.

What are some examples of CPU architectures that do not use a dedicated flag register?,"us What are some examples of CPU architectures that do not use a dedicated flag register?

I've heard that modern processors don't use flags at all, or at least not for CPU control purposes. Is this true? Dolphin, Antergos, Arduino, and several other Linux distributions use a special flag register and an extended instruction set to implement processor flags. Why is this the case? How does this work?

A:

The main purpose of flags is to indicate values that are neither part of the instruction, nor are part of the operand. This can be useful to implement features such as interrupts/exception handling or other features that do not affect the operands of a instruction.

The specific example of an extended instruction set that does not use flags is the wide instruction set of the 80386.

This instruction set uses a special flag register to indicate a number of special conditions. For example, the dw,w instruction will set the flags if the current address is in the 4kb segment.

This instruction set uses a special flag register to indicate a number of special conditions. For example, the dw,w instruction will set the flags if the current address is in the 4kb segment.

System calls, including interrupts and exceptions, are performed using this instruction set.

The 80386 has a feature called ""interrupt privilege"" that prevents interrupts (including exceptions) from being suppressed.

#### 135. On Nature of Knowledge, or How the Philosopher Learns

The knowledge of a thing is in truth that to which we arrive without having learned anything by way of discovery. For it is not by any means the case that for them who have come to know a thing in this way it remains to be learned.

#### 136. On the Knowledge of the Philosopher, or How the Philosopher Acquires Knowledge

The Philosopher has arrived at the knowledge of a thing, in the sense in which he is acquainted with the thing, without having learned the thing by means of the senses, or through memory, or from the thing itself.

#### 137. On the Nature of the Philosopher

We say of the Philosopher that he is a thinker, and that he does not know as he thinks, nor as he understands. For he knows as he understands, but he does not understand as he thinks. This is what is meant by the term ""philosopher.""

#### 138. On the Certainty of Knowledge

The truth of knowledge is such that it is not disturbed by the fancies of imagination, and is altogether untouched by the vagaries of the will.

#### 139. On the Discrepancies of the Senses

The discontents of the senses are all alike. For that which in one sense is pleasant is in another sense unpleasant; that which in one sense is disagreeable is in another sense pleasant; and that which in one sense is bitter is in another sense sweet. This is what is meant by the term ""discrepancy.""

I've never thought I was a ""bad girl"" because I've never had a problem with sex. I've had a few bad experiences and I've tried to chalk it up to my insecurities and my own thoughts of what I was doing wrong. I've always thought that if it was so good why didn't I get any?

What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"Ans: A study to test the genetic contribution for a phenotype. How many different genes are involved in the development of a disease or trait?

The first GWASs were conducted with case-control or family based studies. However, in the last decade, the number of different GWASs conducted increased and now include a larger number of different phenotypes. The different phenotypes can be related to a wide range of diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, etc. In addition, GWASs have been applied to a larger number of different populations. For example, the first GWASs were conducted in European populations. However, the first GWASs in Asian populations were performed in 2009.

GWASs are a useful research tool because they allow researchers to test the genetic contribution for a phenotype. Because of this, GWASs have been conducted in a wide range of different phenotypes, including, but not limited to, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.

GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to",0.784295,0.999497,10.942697,0.998066,0.818822,2.908675,-8.816854476928711

Global inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains elevated in many economies. It will be some time before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.
The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to both global developments and softer demand in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to be around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.
Growth in"," the economy has been weak over the last year. GDP growth is forecast to remain at around 1.5 per cent this year and next. Growth in the economy remains weak, with growth in the labour force and population both falling. Productivity growth has been low in recent years, and this continues to be a concern. In particular, labour productivity has been falling over the last two years, and this is expected to continue. The decline in productivity growth is a major contributor to the slowdown in growth.
The pace of job creation has been slowing over the last year. The unemployment rate has decreased over the last 12 months, but it is still above 5 per cent. The unemployment rate is forecast to decline to 5 per cent by mid-2025. The unemployment rate forecast is based on a number of assumptions. The labour market is very tight, and it is likely that some of the labour market slack is being absorbed by employers. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall despite the increase in the number of employed workers. Continued employment growth is expected to be driven by an increase in net migration.
The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor economic conditions closely. Monetary policy will remain accommodative, and monetary policy easing has been cautious. The bank will continue to track inflation closely, and it will use all available information when assessing the evidence of inflation pressures in the economy. Inflation is expected to remain close to target in 2019, but the bank will be closely monitoring further evidence of inflation pressures.

Why did the Sahara experience a period of rapid desertification?,"ation of the desert, the Sahara, is the desert's most important natural process. A natural process, a process that brings vegetation to an area and fuels a grassland, is more important than the grassland itself. Deserts are formed when thick vegetation dies and is transported by the wind to new, open areas. The process, that is, the removal of vegetation and its transport by the wind to new areas, is called ""desiccation."" In the Sahara, the process is even more important because it is the only process that has been possible for millions of years. The Sahara is still a true desert because the process has not been completed. The Sahara is still green because the desert is not completely dry.

desertification

Desertification or desertification is a process by which land is degraded or destroyed by human activity, usually as a result of overgrazing and excessive use of water resources. The process is often fueled by agricultural practices. Elements which contribute to desertification are soil erosion, salinization, salinization, drought, dust storms, water pollution, and soil compaction.

desertification, desertification, desertification:

1.

The conversion of a natural ecosystem into a desert.

2.

The depletion of a natural ecosystem by human activities, such as overgrazing, overfarming, overpopulation, or overfishing.

3.

The process in which natural ecosystems are transformed into deserts.

deserts, deserts, deserts:

Deserts are places where the ground has been completely dried out by the sun. The Sahara Desert is the largest, most extensive, and most famous desert. Deserts are characterized by a lack of living organisms, except for a few animals that can tolerate the climate and the aridity. The most commonly used term for the Sahara Desert is simply ""desert.""

deserters, desertion, desertions:

A desertion is a sudden or forced withdrawal from a military, political, or other organization. A desertion or deserters can be a ""real"" desertion or a ""hypothetical"" desertion. A real desertion is a person who has left a particular organization and in particular, the military, and is believed to have done so voluntarily. A hypothetical desertion is a person who has left the organization and is believed to have done so involuntarily.

What is a synapse notebook?,"ous, As an image of the organism's brain, a synapse notebook is the next step in the evolution of science notebooks. The notebook is the brain's computational and data storage device, developed to capture and store the data generated by the brain during an event or activity. In that way, it is a replica of all the information that is going to be stored in the brain. But in this case, it is a temporary device designed to capture and store only the data generated during the activity, and it will be discarded after the activity is over. It is not a permanent record of the brain's activities, but instead a temporary device designed to capture the data generated during an activity. As a result, it is much more efficient for brain activities and computations. This notebook is called a synapse because it is a connection between two neurons. The two neurons are the different parts of the brain, and the connection is a synapse. This notebook is used to record the information that is going to be stored in the brain during an activity. The information captured by the notebook is a snapshot of the activity that will be stored in the brain. The brain can store this information without the need of the notebook because it has a very high capacity. If any information is captured by the notebook, it can be stored in the brain. But the notebook has a limited capacity, which means that if it is used to record more information than it can store, it will need to be discarded after the activity is over.

A:

Here is an idea for a solution:

Array.reduce(function (result, item) {
  if (item.type === 'tree') {
    result.push(item);
    return result;
  } else {
    return result;
  }
}, []).filter(function (item) {
  return item.type === 'animal'
});

This solution is approximately 2x as fast.
This algorithm requires the use of a temporary result array.
If you are worried about performance, you can use a stack to hold the temporary values instead.

A:

The problem is, a single tree will have a lot of ""animal"" objects.
You can do it in a single pass:
var classes = {
  type: ""tree"",
  objects: []
};

for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  var item = {
    type: ""animal"",
    objects: []
  };

  // push a new ""animal"" object on the array
  classes.objects.push(item);

  // define the type of the object
  item.type = ""animal"";

  // check if the object is a tree
  if (item.type === ""tree"") {
    // create a new object from the tree
    item.objects = item.objects.concat(classes.objects);
  }
}

var result = [];

for (var i = 0; i < classes.objects.length; i++) {
  result.push(classes.objects[i]);
}

return result;

Update:
If you want to sort the result by type, you can use a Map instead of an array. The Map acts like an array but there are no indices. It is not ordered, so you have to do a linear search to find the object you are looking for.

What is IMPS?,"IMPS is a toolkit for the identification and modeling of imbricate process systems. It provides a framework to specify, analyze, and model imbricate processes in a consistent and consistent format.Modeling and analysis of imbricate processesIntegrated Process System SIMPSAIMPS provides a standard framework for modeling and analyzing imbricate process-systems. It is based on the use of a standard representation of the imbricate process-system that is adapted to the imbricate process-system in question. This representation provides a common language for the specification, analysis, and modeling of imbricate process-systems.This standard framework includes: (1) a modeling language that extends the modeling language of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10303 standard for describing imbricate processes; (2) an analysis language that extends the analysis language of the ISO 10303 standard; and (3) an integration language that extends the integration language of the ISO 10303 standard.The modeling language is based on the ISO 10303-1 standard and specifies the components of the imbricate process-system, their interrelationships, and their functionalities. The analysis language is based on the ISO 10303-2 standard and is used to specify the process-system and its control, to analyze the process-system, and to calculate the associated economic benefits. The integration language is based on the ISO 10303-3 standard and is used to integrate the process-system and the subprocesses.

AIMPS can be used to (1) describe and model imbricate processes, (2) calculate the economic benefits of an imbricate process-system, (3) identify the imbricate process-system's components, (4) specify the imbricate process-system's control, (5) analyze the imbricate process-system, and (6) calculate the economic benefits of the imbricate process-system.

","Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) is an instant payment inter-bank electronic funds transfer system in India. IMPS offers an inter-bank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. The service is available 24x7 throughout the year including bank holidays. NEFT was also made available 24x7 from December 2019. RTGS was also made available 24x7 from 14th December 2020.

It is managed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and is built upon the existing National Financial Switch network. In 2010, the NPCI initially carried out a pilot for the mobile payment system with 4 member banks (State Bank of India, Bank of India, Union Bank of India and ICICI Bank), and expanded it to include Yes Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank later that year. IMPS was publicly launched on 22 November 2010. Currently, there are 53 commercial banks, 101 Rural/District/Urban and cooperative banks, and 24 PPIi signed up for the IMPS service.

How does the Stock Market work?,"""

A:

The typical way to read a financial statement is as a snapshot of ""what happened"" during the financial year.
The year starts on 1 January, and is divided into twelve months.
The statement is divided into two sections. The first section shows how the company's assets, and the equity of the owner, have changed during the year. The second shows how the company's liabilities have changed.
An asset is anything that can be sold (or could be sold, or has been sold) for money. For example, a company can have an asset of a building, or an asset of a computer, or an asset of a company car.
An owner owns an asset, and a company has several owners, each owning a share in the company. The owner of a share in a company owns a share of the assets of that company.
So the first line of a financial statement shows how the assets of the company, and the owners of the company, have changed.
The second line of the financial statement shows how the liabilities of the company, and the owners of the company, have changed.
A company doesn't have to have money flowing through it (or assets of any kind) to earn a profit. If the company sells a good for money, it earns a profit. If the company pays a bill for money, and pays interest on the money, the company earns a profit. And if the company pays a bill for money and pays a dividend, the company earns a profit.
A company can also earn a profit by earning money in other ways, such as by selling goods, or by investing money, or by borrowing money from others.
A business' profits are divided into two parts. The first part is called shareholders' profits. The shareholders of the company own a share of the profits.
The second part is called non-shareholders' profits. This part includes all the profits not owned by the shareholders.
A business can also earn a profit by paying dividends to its shareholders.
If a business pays dividends to its shareholders, the shareholders get money. If a business doesn't pay dividends, the shareholders don't get money.
If a business pays a dividend to shareholders, this is called a dividend payment.
Dividends are paid to shareholders by companies at certain times.
A dividend is a payment to a shareholder of money.
The dividend is called a dividend because the company pays it with money. It's not called a","The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.",0.182273,0.987467,21.50913,0.965556,0.193405,4.767566,-4.7120208740234375

Who tends to participates in hackathons?,"

The most common type of hackathon that I've found is the hackathon with an aim to
develop and produce a product or service.

The key difference between hackathons and e-events is that e-events are more
about the technology and process behind it, and hackathons are more about the
people and their passion.

For example, the ""hackathon"" event that I attended was called ""YouCards"" and
the goal was to bring the latest and greatest in tech to the masses. The
technology was very technical, but there was an extreme passion to get the
technology out into the market to the people.

I was going to say, but then you made it sound like it was the people.

I'm working on a startup on a hackathon weekend. The best thing about hackathons
is that they give me a great opportunity to not only network with other start-
ups, but to also see if I can make connections with the general public.

It's really helped my business more than it has helped my personal life.

That's not a bad way to start off a weekend. I've been starting off my weekend
in Portland by going to hackathons to see if I can connect with other
entrepreneurs.

I like hackathons for 2 reasons:

1\. There is no pressure to raise money from VC's or angel investors

2\. People who attend hackathons tend to be passionate about things and
endeavors

This is the best way to find out what you are passionate about.

throwaway_royce
I think hackathons are great for two reasons.

1\. You can learn a lot about a topic by getting people to show off their
skills and coding skills without the pressure of making a product.

2\. You can get a lot of exposure, so you can get yourself noticed in the
general tech community.

""Dear Sir,

""I have been told that a Mrs. Snell, of Salina, Kansas, has been to see you about this matter.

How many seasons of Survivor has there been?,".

Why do you think the vote got so out of hand there?

Coug: Haha, I don't know... I really don't want to speculate. But I think the fact that there was a lot of voting for people that were not in the bottom three or people that were not in the top three, that was the reason. There was a lot of pressure from the top three people and the bottom three people and a lot of confusion. I think that was probably why there was a lot of voting in the middle.

So there was a lot of vote buying happening?

Coug: Yeah. I don't know if that was the reason, but I think that was the reason why there was a lot of voting in the middle.

Ben: I think there was a lot of vote buying too. I think the reason was that the bottom three guys were really vulnerable.

Coug: Yeah, I think they were. I think the votes were there, and they were just not there.

Will you say that the people who voted for you were the same people who voted for Joe?

Coug: Oh, yes they were.

Ben: No, I'm just kidding!

Coug: Oh, yeah.

Ben: Cougar, let me ask you this: do you think you'd be a better leader for the people who voted for you?

Coug: Oh, yeah. Of the people who voted for me, I think I would have been a better leader.

Ben: Are you saying that people voted for you for the wrong reasons?

Coug: I think I would have been a better leader for the people who voted for me. I think I would have been a better leader for them. I think I would have been a better leader for the people who voted for me than Joe was.

Ben: Can you give me an example of how you would have been a better leader for those people?

Coug: Well, I don't know if you can give me an example. I think I would have been a better leader for them, because I would have been a stronger leader. I would have been a better leader, and I think I would have been a better leader for them than Joe was.

What is surfing?,"ation The act of getting out of bed, and on your feet, in order to go on your way. Like a military man out of his bed, or a hunter going out to find game. Which is not ‘riding’ at all, but ‘being on the move’ in the fresh air, or the sea, or the sky, or the forest, or some other space. The opposite of sitting in the same space, not ‘on’, but ‘in’, like a king, a queen, or any other monarch.

Which is why, as I write, in my humble house in a village of the tiny and picturesque town of Ollantaytambo, I have a large and pleasant garden, with many flowers, and a fountain, and fruit trees, and a bowl of water, and a doorway into the house, and a window, and a mango, and a grape, and a fig, and a lemon, and a banana, and a papaya, and a melon, and, on the side of the house, a vegetable patch. I am at once in the garden, and in my house.

There are many ways to say it.

And if we are in another place, or space, or time, or place, then there is a reason for it. Why? Because we are in a place, or space, or time, or place.

If you are in a place, or space, or time, or place, then it is not only ‘good’, or ‘bad’, or ‘wonderful’, or ‘horrible’, but, it is a reason for it.

And if it is a reason for it, then it is not only ‘good’, or ‘good’ or ‘great’, or ‘bad’, or ‘bad’ or ‘wonderful’, or ‘horrible’, but, it is also ‘just’.

And if it is ‘just’ then it is also ‘good’ or ‘great’, or ‘good’, or ‘wonderful’, or ‘horrible’, but, it is also ‘just’.

Thanks, I appreciate it. --lubbock_lawyer, on May 13, 2014

Answer:

Hi Lubbock_Lawyer. Yes, you can certainly contact either of them. If you want, you can send them an email or a quick phone call to schedule a meeting. The important thing is that you are communicating with them and letting them know that you want to talk and meet with them. It is a good idea to keep the conversations as productive as possible, as they should not be about you directly as you are not interested in doing that. Just get them to say that you will contact them if you ever have more questions.

You can also route all of your calls to their voicemail, and you can always call back later at your convenience. If you are concerned about the language barrier, you may simply just speak with them in English.

If you need to reach out in the future, just send them an email or a quick phone message, and make sure to mention to them that you are interested in speaking with them.

Hi, I'm looking for a lawyer that can help me with some issues I'm having with my car. I'm a single mother of a 2 1/2 year old boy. My boyfriend and I bought the car together. He's a truck driver, and I'm a secretary. We had been going out for about a year when we bought the car, and we got married in February of 2012. I had my license when we got married, and I have not had it renewed since. I know that the car is mine, but I think that he is the one who put the title in my name. He has been driving the car since November of 2012. My boyfriend has been driving the car for a while, and we've never had any problems with it. I have never been in an accident with the car, and I've never been cited. My boyfriend has passed my car to me, so I don't think that that is an issue.

The presenter has been on the air for quite a while, so the program was an extension of her personality. She has a very good voice with a nice accent, and an easy going personality. Her show was interactive and informative, but not overly so as to become boring.

So, the next time you are bored, or get a little too involved in your own world, look at the programs on the radio waves, if you are tuned into the radio waves, and see what is on, and if it is not what you want to hear, then change the station, and try something else. You can always find something you like on the radio waves, if it is not on your radio wave, then you can go to your computer and try to look at the internet for the show, or go to the TV and watch the TV show, or if you are just not interested, then find something else to eat, or do something else, or go to the movies, or another place, and see what you want to see. Try to find something you like, if you can find something you like, then it is good to be alive and able to enjoy things, rather than being bored.

Now, the language you see here is not written in any particular language. It is just text that is translated into any language. So, it is translated into English and into Chinese.

And it is relative, right?

So, I have a relationship. So, I can say, “Oh, I’m a relative of the wild boar.” And so that’s a nice thing. And it’s a nice relationship.

And so, it is really important to see that in a Chinese culture. Because the Chinese culture has a peculiar way of thinking about things. And that is the way that you get a sense of what it is to be a relative. And what it is to be a relative is an important thing to learn.

And it’s really important to understand the culture. Because when you are talking with people, you don’t have to talk about the details. You can just talk about the big picture. But if you don’t understand the culture, if you don’t understand the culture, you can get in trouble.

It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water.",0.272414,0.952049,51.334485,0.99669,0.273696,10.765867,-15.495348930358887

What is an open platform?,": build with open source software and use an open source license?

This is not about Linux itself, it's about the fact that the Linux conference has been moved to a new location. The LinuxCon is not an event that is about Linux itself, it's about Linux advocacy, Linux politics, Linux and open source. You can't have one without the other. We have a lot of new people who are coming to LinuxCon, but there's a lot of people who have been coming for five years.

What do you think the future holds for Linux and open source?

I think the future is really bright. I think that Linux and open source is in a much better place than it has ever been. I think that as a community, we're at a point where we can do things that we could never have done before. The LinuxCon is a great example of that.

In a way, LinuxCon is the evolution of the Linux user community. What would you say have been key to the success of LinuxCon, both in terms of the conference and the Linux user community?

I think LinuxCon itself is a key part of that. It's a key part of the open source community. It's a key part of the Linux community. It's a key part of the Linux user community. We have a lot of people who have been coming to LinuxCon for years and years. You can't have an event like this without the LinuxCon.

If you look at the history of open source, it started with a user community, and that's just where the growth has come from. The growth has come from the Linux user community. The growth has come from the open source community. It's a growth that we've seen over the years. It's a growth that we continue to see.

We're seeing that growth continue. We've seen a lot of companies that are adopting Linux as their primary operating system. We're seeing a lot of enterprises adopting Linux. We see a lot of universities adopting Linux. We see a lot of people in the open source community creating their own products. We're seeing a lot of people creating new products around open source. Those are all increasing the size of the Linux user community and the size of the open source community.

I think there's a lot more than that. I think there are a lot of groups, including the Linux community, that are just becoming really passionate about open source. They're not just talking about","A platform is open if it provides you options for how you experience your data platform: open frameworks, multiple languages, common libraries, CI/CD tooling, APIs, IDEs, internal or external orchestration.

Give me some things to think about when planning a party," freetime :3

There are so many brilliant ideas here, and I hope to tackle some of them, I'll just have to sit down and write a proper post on it. I mean, you've got so much to say, and I don't even know where to start!

I had a cousin who got married recently, and we laughed so hard at her awful wedding. I think her bridesmaids even had a good laugh at her. She had a very plain, white dress, and a very plain, white veil. And they spent a lot of money on her shoes, because they were the only shoes she wore, and her shoes were dreadful.

I put the shoes on a pedestal, and I said, ""Oh, that's just the kind of shoes that would make a bride look like a bride. You can't really expect to see any spirit in such a plain, shiny, white shoe.""

They were such lovely shoes, I couldn't believe that they were the wrong kind of shoes.

However, I do think that the bride should have her own idea of what she wants. I don't think that the dress should look like something she's picked out because it's from a catalog. I also think that it's a good idea to have a theme that you want to wear. But I think that the bride should be able to put what she wants in her own dress.

And I think that the bride should have something that she wants to wear on the big day, but that she feels comfortable wearing. For example, the bride may want to wear white in her wedding dress, but she doesn't want to wear white like a funeral dress.

I think that it's a good idea to have a theme that you want to wear. I think that you can make great dresses for any theme, and that you can wear them any way that you want to.

1. What is your budget? Planning a party can cost money and you should first determine how much you're willing to spend on it.  
2. Where is your party? You should first decide on the location of your party. It could be at your home, in a pubic park, or in a rented space.  
3. Who is coming? Choose a number of guests that will fit the space comfortably. Once you have a number, make your guest list. It's good to ensure that your guests will mesh well with each other, but most importantly, choose a list of people that you'd like to host.
4. When is your party? It's good to choose a time that most of your guest will be able to make it. If your party is outdoor, you should consider the weather when choosing a date. 
5. What are you serving? Consider if you want alcohol at your party and how much food you will need. If your party is during a meal time, you should provide that meal for your",0.173654,0.997998,15.645888,0.986642,0.127867,3.58641,-4.057193756103516

Why did naatu naatu get oscar for best original song?,"u uproar.

The good news is the best original song is actually still in our ears. It's called Naanu Naanu and was released by the Spice Girls at the start of their career.

The song is the most successful ever by the band, with its video breaking records and spawning a whole new wave of interest in and nostalgia for the band.

No-one could have predicted the huge success of the song. But the song itself - simple and beautiful - was written and composed by the band's manager, Simon Fuller, who was also responsible for the success of the Spice Girls.

The song's success took Fuller to the top of the charts and ushered in a new chapter in the band's history.

What's more, the song is still a part of our culture to this day.

As an artiste, I'm proud to have written a song that went on to become so popular.

The Spice Girls were such an important part of my life, and their impact on music is still being felt today.

Oh, and the song also won me an Oscar.

The Spice Girls: The story of a band that changed pop music forever

Of course, the song's success also led to the demise of the Spice Girls. It was the song which got them the attention they needed to become a household name.

But the Spice Girls, as brilliant as they were, weren't the only band to change the world with their music.

Take a look at how artists such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zepplin changed pop music with their music.

Fourteen years after they released the Beatles' first record, they were a massive, global success.

The band's first record, Please Please Me, was a huge hit and has become one of the biggest selling albums of all time.

But the Beatles' biggest hit was the song Love Me Do, which became the first 24-hour number one in the UK.

Love Me Do was the first song to be played on American radio stations, where it became a huge hit. It's now known as one of the biggest-selling single of all time.

The band's popularity grew to the point where their music was played on the radio in countries as diverse as North Korea and Japan - and even in the","Naatu Naatu became a global sensation and quickly went viral on social media after the film's release ast year.

The Blue Carnation by Elizabeth Savage

(Smashwords Edition)

**L ESTER DELAUNE.**

The first time I saw the Blue Carnation was in a picture book. It was on a bookcase at the library. The picture was of a child sitting on a bench, holding a blue carnation, blue for Christmas. The flower was a little smaller than the child's hand, and the color of the child's dress was blue, too. I read the book and fell in love with it. The next time I saw the book was in a store. The book was on a shelf. It was folded, and the flowers were in a vase. The color was a pale blue, not the same shade as the flowers. The child was a little taller than I am. She had long, curly hair, a shy smile, and looked around the room as if she might recognize someone or something. The carnation she held was as big as my hand, and the color of the flower was the same as it is in the picture on the bookcase. She held the flower with the same hand, and the way she held it looked as if she would not let it drop. I read the book again. I fell in love with it again. I knew I had to have it for myself.

**L ESTER DELAUNE**

When I was a little girl, I knew there was something special about the blue carnation. I knew it was the flower that had made the book so special. I knew I had to have it. But I was afraid of it. I knew that if I wanted to love it, I had to love it in the same way the people of the book did. I thought if I allowed myself to love it, I might free myself","Synonyms: care, like, affection

"Tell me which muscle the following exercises help build: bench press, dips, dumbbell curls, deadlift, and squat.",", the advice can be found at, of course, but we’d like you to point out the differences between each person’s approach. So, here we go…

BENCH PRESS

The bench press is one of the most frequently used exercises in the gym, making it a great exercise to build strength. When you do bench presses, you’re using a lot more muscle than you would use when just doing an overhead press. The bench press is one of the best ways to work on the pecs, and it’s also a great progression for the triceps.

DIPS

Dips are another great exercise to strengthen the pecs. You’ll use more muscle than when you just do an overhead press, and you can also work on your core and your lower back.

DUMBBELL CURLS

Dumbbell curls are a great exercise for working on your chest and biceps. They’re also a great exercise to do in the gym because you get a lot of repetitions in the time that it takes to do your bench press.

SQUAT

Squats are another great exercise to strengthen your lower body. You can also use them to target your quads and your hamstrings.

LOWER BODY EXERCISES

The squat is a great exercise to work on your lower body, and not just your quads and your hamstrings. The squat is a great exercise to do because you can use it to target your posterior chain, your gluteus maximus, your hamstrings, and your quads.

BURPEES

Burpees are a great exercise to do because they work on your lower body, your core, and your hamstrings. They also work on your gluteus maximus.

T-SHIRTS

When you get into shape, you want to make sure that you get T-shirts that are both fitted and comfortable. That’s not to say that you can’t have a tank top, just that you want to make sure that you’re wearing something that isn’t too tight and isn’t too loose. That’s why you want to look for a T-shirt that’s not too tight, but also isn’t too loose.

A:

With the exception of a minivan, you can purchase a car with 4 seats, but you might not be able to fit 4 people.  It depends on the model.  A minivan will likely be the most comfortable for you, but it will also be the most expensive car.  You could try driving a car with 3 adult seats and a 4th child seat and see if it fits.  If it does not, you might be able to buy a sporty car with 2 adult seats and a child seat.  If you can get a car with all 4 seats, it's probably cheaper.  
If you can't find a sporty car with 3 adult seats, you might be able to buy a mid-size car with a 3rd row of seats.  The problem is that you may not be able to fit 8 people in this car.  A minivan or sport-utility vehicle with 5 or more seats is a better choice.  
If you can't find a sport-utility vehicle with 3 or more seats, you could get a compact car with a third row of seats.

Air quality is a leading cause of chronic respiratory disease and death in the United States. Air pollution derived from automobile exhaust, coal burning power plants, and industrial facilities is a major public health threat. The total area of United States covered by the Clean Air Act is 2.7 million square miles, or about 6.7 percent of the country's landmass. The law regulates emissions from large-scale stationary sources, such as power plants and refineries, and from mobile sources, such as automobiles and trucks.The Clean Air Act is the most important piece of environmental legislation enacted since the National Environmental Policy Act, which was enacted in 1970. The Clean Air Act was first passed in 1963, but it was not until the 1970s that the first national ambient air quality standards were established. In 1990, Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments. In 2007, Congress passed the Clean Air Act Extension Act, which extended the Clean Air Act's provisions for three years. In 2008, Congress passed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Act Reauthorization Act. This bill reauthorized the Clean Air Act for five years and extended the law's provisions for three years. The Clean Air Act is intended to protect the public health by limiting air pollution. Air pollution is a major cause of respiratory disease and death in the United States. Some of the diseases associated with air pollution are asthma, emphysema, heart and lung diseases, and cancer. People who smoke, who live in polluted areas, and people who work in polluted areas are at high risk for developing respiratory disease. A person is considered to be at high risk for developing respiratory disease if they smoke, live in a high-risk area, or work in a high-risk area for air pollution. The Clean Air Act requires states to develop regional plans to control air pollution. The Act also requires the EPA to set national ambient air quality standards that limit the amount of certain air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The EPA must set these standards to protect public health. The EPA is responsible for setting these air pollution standards. The EPA sets the standards in order to prevent people from developing respiratory diseases. The EPA must set the standards to prevent people from developing respiratory diseases.

When did the fist episode of Family Guy air?,"c

Jun 11, 2018 · In this week’s episode of Family Guy, the Griffin family faces their biggest challenge yet: the death of their father. In this episode of Family Guy, Peter, Chris, and Stewie are trying to make sense of what happened to their dad. Chris is convinced that he was murdered by a bunch of hippies, Stewie thinks their dad was a crazy person, Peter just wants to forget about the whole thing, and Lois is trying to figure out who their father was. The family is having a hard time coping with their loss, but they’re also facing some more pressing problems, like finding the best way to kill off Peter’s girlfriend, Meg.

Feb 15, 2018 · The latest episode of The Simpsons features the family's new baby, a surprise for Bart. It's nice to see the Simpsons family get together. The Simpsons has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I loved the early seasons, and the new ones are great too. The Simpsons and Family Guy are both made by 20th Century Fox, which makes it curious that they are both on FOX. It's like they both have different goals. Family Guy is more about humor, and the Simpsons is more about family.

Who is the most sensational player in MLB today?," dante to the lineup. If there be good, but not the best, boys, this is an excellent day to recognize them.""

Bases loaded, one out, and the A's were trailing 1-0 in the seventh inning. But Dye was a little more than just good. He was brilliant. He had already hit his second home run in the game, and he got two more in the inning, including a grand slam to give the A's a 6-1 lead.

In the eighth inning, Dye hit a leadoff home run off of A.J. Griffin, and then he hit a solo shot to left field. And in the ninth inning, Dye hit a solo home run, a two-run shot to deep left center.

""I love Dye,"" said Buddy Biancalana, the A's pitching coach. ""He's the guy who can get on base, and he's a great all-around player. He's a good hitter.""

Dye's second home run was his second of the game. In fact, he hit one ball so hard that it bounced up about three feet off the ground before making trouble for the A's.

""He's got a good arm, a good bat, and he can run,"" said Red Sox manager Billy Goodman. ""He's a good power hitter. I think he's been overlooked a little bit, but he's a good hitter, and he's a good guy. He's a kid. He's a good kid.""

Dye is just 21 years old, and he'll be eligible for the major league roster in a few weeks. And if he can prove that he can be a regular major league player -- or even an everyday major league player -- this season, the Red Sox could seriously consider trading Dye.

""I've worked with a lot of players who were in their 20s, and they're not a lot of fun to be around, but they're still good players,"" said Red Sox manager Terry Francona. ""We don't have any plans to trade anybody, but this is probably the first time I've seen a guy who's so good, and fun to watch.""

Now, it can be said that Dye is just a lot of fun to watch. He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated, and he was on the cover of Baseball America. He's got a young wife, and his father is",Shohei Ohtani,0.199089,0.981223,14.288562,0.833076,0.22479,3.305348,-4.4723052978515625

The goal was to characterize each crop in terms of Earth's sensitivity, its carbon-cycle impact, and its ability to store carbon.

Researchers are exploring the potential of different crop varieties and their ability to sequester carbon from the atmosphere.

Most of the world's food production is now grown in greenhouses, which help increase yields and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But researchers say there are limits to how much carbon can be sequestered.

""If you look at monoculture, you're not getting a lot of this, you're not really getting a lot of carbon sequestration,"" said Howard. ""So what we're trying to do is figure out how to increase the carbon sequestration potential of these crops.""

The New York Times surprised me with an article about J.D. Salinger. Apparently, Salinger has a reputation as a recluse. However, according to the Times, he was quite active until recently, and was a very generous philanthropist.

One of the most interesting things about the article is that it discusses the making of Mr. Salinger's classic book 'Catcher in the Rye,' which has sold more than 65 million copies. In fact, it is the most translated book in the world. I wonder if it is the most translated book in the English-speaking world.

I am not a great fan of Mr. Salinger. I have always thought that he was kind of a pretentious writer. However, I have started to like his work more recently. I think that his writing is much more modern and interesting than many of his contemporaries.

I am especially interested in the section about his early writing when he was in a group that was called the Beats. This was shortly after he had left the military and was working for the New York Times.

If you have ever read my blog before, you know that I am not a big fan of the Atlantic Monthly. However, I am a fan of their magazine.

In fact, I think that there is a lot of interesting material in the magazine. The article I am thinking of is an article about the mystery of the disappearance of the USS Titanic. The article is called ""The Titanic Mystery"" and it was published in the July/August 2005 issue of The Atlantic Monthly.

The article is written by David McCullough, who is the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book 'John Adams.' He also wrote the book 'The Path Between the Seas.'

I am not sure if this is a good article to read on a vacation. However, I think that it will be a good read if you really want to know the truth about this mystery.

What is a water hammer?," of water hammers, water hammer sign, water hammer syndromeWhat is a water hammer?A water hammer is a sound caused by the sudden release of pressure through a small crack in a pipe. A water hammer occurs when a high-pressure water stream enters a low-pressure area of a pipe. The sudden pop of water is very loud.

I would think it would be hardest emotionally to let go of the guilt. It would have to be hard emotionally. I know I would have to work to let go of my guilt. And I know I wouldn't have been able to do it without help from my husband.

","While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

He also made a lot of money, even if he’s not in the Hall. I didn’t know that. But I guess he did.

He’s coming off a career year, so maybe he can be a decent second-tier pitcher. But he’s not really a top-tier pitcher. He’s a fairly good starter. He’s everthhing to me.

They’re the kind of guys that are really not good, but they play a role in the game. He’s a really good young pitcher who puts up a decent number of innings, but he’s not really a top-tier starter. He’s not even a top-tier reliever.

And this is a guy who went to the Hall of Fame despite having his best years in the minors. It’s really odd.

The fact that he’s in the Hall of Fame despite having his best years in the minors also makes me wonder how the hell he managed to get in the Hall. There’s no way he should have gotten in. It’s just a complete mystery.

I don’t know if I’m gonna get to see him much this season. I’ve got some high school stuff that I have to do. But I’m hoping to see him this season, which would be great.

I’m not sure that I’d want to see him in person. I’d just like to see him pitch in the game. I’d love to see him pitch for the Mets. I’d love to see him pitch. He’s a really good pitcher.

I’m really excited to see him. I’ll be at the stadium. It’s going to be a fun game. I’m looking forward to it.

I’m in the same boat as you.

We’ll be at the stadium.

What are some creative inspirations for a beginner photographer?,"A: I was totally inspired by this video by the guy who makes the ""awww"" sounds. I'm also constantly inspired by the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz."" I always wanted to be a wizard when I was a kid. I played with a light-switcher toy and I remember thinking ""when I grow up I want to be a wizard.""

What is your favorite subject or genre of photography? ckP: I really like the subject of ""people."" I wish I could've worked with more people. I like landscape, portrait and the city. I think I'm most comfortable with people, but in all the different settings.

What is your advice for someone who wants to become a photographer? ckP: I'm really good at setting up an environment and creating a natural light. I would say that you need to see what you're capable of, and then work towards that.

What do you do when you aren't photographing? ckP: I have a little kitten that goes by the name of Camille. She's the only pet in the house, but she's a lovely cat. I'm very interested in her personality and what she's going to be like as she gets older. I'm always reading about the latest studies about aging and how that changes our brain function. Camille is 7-years-old, so I'm constantly thinking about her.

What inspires you to create? ckP: I'm constantly inspired by the beauty of people. Every day I see something that I'm inspired by. I feel that I'm always looking to see what I can find.

What is the most important piece of equipment you currently own? ckP: My camera. I consider it to be my companion. I'm constantly taking pictures and looking at them.

What do you do when you aren't photographing? ckP: I'm currently working on a graphic novel, ""Witchblade"" by Jim Butcher. It's a graphic novel, but it's based on a comic book series by the same name. It's a spinoff of ""Witchblade."" I'm working on the first volume of it now. I also teach writing and writing workshops every month.

Second, vary the lighting conditions. Revisit your familiar photo spots at different hours - during the sunrise, sunset, at noon, in pitch darkness and of course, during the golden hours when the world around you embraces that warm glow.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

I wrote my first C# program in 2001, a navigation tool. It was a proof of concept, but I didn't publish it, not because I didn't have the time to do it, but because I didn't have the time to do it right.

I wrote my first Windows Forms program in 2002, a program to make a simple calendar. I was so excited to finally be able to use that wonderful control that Windows Forms offered, but I couldn't get it to work. I got so frustrated that I just gave up.

Why are most plans green?,"ilL-arginine 4-methyl-1-piperazinylmethyl ester (N-L-Arg-Phe) is a synthetic analogue of the naturally-occurring amino acid L-Arginine. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of L-Arg-Phe on the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and of the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) in the mouse brain. Two weeks after administration a single intraperitoneal dose of L-Arg-Phe (50 mg/kg) to mice, it was observed that there was a significant increase in the amount of NOS protein in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and a significant decrease in the levels of L-NMMA in the same regions. The amount of NOS protein in the brain stem and cerebellum did not change significantly. These findings suggest that L-Arg-Phe can stimulate the synthesis of NOS in the brain of mice.",Plants look green to us because they absorb red light most efficiently and reflect green light.

Step 1.  Clear a perimeter that is roughly 12 feet in diameter.   Make sure you are in an open area, where tree limbs are not hanging over the campfire to avoid secondary fires.   Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter

"In order to perform CPR, identify a useful and dangerous set of rules to follow from the following items: Panic, tap and shout, walk away, look for breathing, get an AED, and push hard/fast to give 30 compressions to the chest.","Dose of epinephrine in a person with a cardiac arrest is 15 mcg/kg/min. Here's the thing: I'm not sure it's possible to tell a medical person how to do CPR with as much precision as a lay person can. If you have a friend, family member or coworker who knows CPR, ask them to demonstrate the technique for you. If you don't, ask a doctor or paramedic what the steps are. Be prepared to ask questions about the technique, anatomy, and physiology.

It's also important to recognize that, with the exception of some very rare circumstances, the only person who can actually start CPR is the person who is already on the scene and who the victim is. It's not the first responder's job to start CPR. In fact, it might be the first responder's job to stop CPR.

5. DefibrillateAfter you have defibrillated the victim, administer CPR again if possible, and this time, defibrillate. If the victim is still alive, continue CPR. If you are not sure you have defibrillated the victim, you will be asked to do it again. If you do not defibrillate the victim, you can be charged with a Class B misdemeanor.

By now, you should be able to give emergency care to someone with a cardiac arrest, without any formal training. You will need to know what you're doing, and you will need to know what to do in case you are unsure.

Now, I bring them home, and then I throw them away. I throw them in a trash can. I do not put them in a bag. I do not put them in a bin. I do not put them in the garbage. I just throw them away. I throw them away in the trash can. I go into the trash can and then I throw the clothes away. When I throw them away, I throw them out. I do not throw them away all at once. I start by throwing","I’m not sure that this pencil is right for you.  First, I would need to know more about why you need a pencil and what you will use it for.

The good news is that it's finally being brought to my attention that there's a lot more to today's post than the subject of ""humor."" Today's post is about the most famous American comedian of the 20th century, Eddie Murphy.

I've been a fan of Eddie Murphy since I saw the comedian (in 1972) in the ""Laugh-In"" episode, where he played a character named ""Eddie."" (You can watch the episode here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2b2eNJZyws.) I was surprised to learn that Eddie Murphy is from New Jersey, not Alabama. I was even more surprised to learn that Eddie Murphy's real name is not Eddie Murphy, but rather ""Edwin MacFarlane.""

On the other hand, I had no idea that Eddie Murphy was the son of a millionaire. I thought he was a working stiff with a college degree. I was also pretty surprised to learn that William H. Murphy worked as a lawyer for Frank Sinatra.

I had no idea that Eddie Murphy's real name was not ""Eddie"" but rather ""Edwin MacFarlane.""

","There is no common agreement on which play written by William Shakespeare is the greatest. In total, William Shakespeare wrote approximately 39 plays, each of which can be broadly categorized into three main groups: histories, comedies and tragedies. Henry V and Richard III are regarded amongst his finest histories, both featuring an English king as their eponymous character. The Tempest and A Midsummer Night's Dream are considered to be amongst his best comedies; whilst tragedies were arguably Shakespeare's greatest genre - Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar and King Lear are all amongst his finest contributions to this field. Of these, Romeo and Juliet is often considered to be the greatest love story ever written, and Hamlet is widely regarded as one of the most important analyses of the human condition. William Shakespeare's plays are widely believed to be amongst the greatest ever written, and to this day are regularly performed around the world.",0.394632,0.645608,12.818379,0.43935,0.357921,2.931178,-10.483540534973145
Explain the best way to swing a golf iron compared to a golf driver.," If you're golfing with friends or with your family, it is very important to know the best way to swing a golf iron compared to a golf driver. This is especially true if you're using a club that is designed to be used with a driver. If you're using a club designed to be used with a driver, it typically has a low ""sweet spot"" at the top of the club head. This means that it is difficult to hit the ball at the higher part of the golf club head. If you swing a club with a higher ""sweet spot"" at the top of the club head, you will hit the ball higher. This is the best way to swing a club with a low ""sweet spot"" at the top of the club head. It is the best way to swing a golf club. As you swing the club, the club head will move from side to side. The best way to swing the golf club is to keep the golf club head pointed in the direction of the ball. When hitting the ball, you must shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot as you swing the golf club. If you shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot, the golf club will move from side to side and the golf club head will move from the bottom of the golf club head to the top of the golf club head.

Why is it important to swing the golf club head from the bottom of the golf club head to the top of the golf club head? This is because it is this moment that the golf club head makes contact with the ball.

What is a ""sweet spot""? A ""sweet spot"" is a very important part of a golf club. A ""sweet spot"" is that area of the golf club head that hits the ball, and this is why it is important to keep the golf club head pointed in the direction of the ball. It is also the moment when the golf club makes contact with the ball. As you swing the golf club, the club head will move from side to side. If the club head isn't pointed in the direction of the ball, the club head will hit the ball and not make contact with the ball. If the club head is pointed in the direction of the ball, the club head will hit the ball and make contact with the ball.

How to Hit the Ball with the Golf Club Having made this important distinction, it becomes easy to understand the best way to hit the ball with the golf club. There are two important","When hitting an iron you want to make a downward striking motion in the grass. The driver is more of a sweeping motion through the ball.

Should we all use Qubes OS for most daily task that involve the internet?,"ation.

Devices such as Smart TVs, Playstations, and game consoles are the most susceptible to hacks, and are the devices most likely to be used to browse the internet. The smart TVs are really dumb boxes that need to be controlled by an expert. A lot of people are willing to pay for these services, but those are the same people that are likely to be the most susceptible to hacks.

Widely used devices such as IP cameras, set-top boxes, and routers are also less likely to be compromised.

I use a Qubes system, but I'm willing to consider using a non-secure Linux system in certain circumstances, such as if I'm using a cloud provider like Google for my email, or if I have a really slow internet connection. But it can not be used in all situations, as it will not be more secure than a regular OS.

As for the privacy and security of a Linux system, it's almost impossible to do anything without the user's knowledge.

For example, once I installed a non-root user, I could use the command ""dig +short"" to see what sites are available, and if the system is vulnerable, I could do it remotely, but only after logging in as root, and then using ""dig +short"" to see what sites are available.

I see a lot of people here who think that CVE-2015-2522 is a real threat to them. I will disagree.

I have a Qubes OS VM, and I'm not using it. I don't have or care about it. I have a regular Ubuntu VM, and I have nothing to do with it. I use it to test software I'm developing. I connect to it remotely through a VPN.

I don't care about the OS I'm using. I don't care if my Ubuntu VM has CVE-2015-2522. I use it to test software. If CVE-2015-2522 happens on my Ubuntu VM, I fix it, and I don't care anymore.

I don't care if my Ubuntu VM uses a different OS. I don't care if someone else uses it.

"Tell me which of these characters are in Disney or Dreamworks movies: Shrek, Simba, Lightning McQueen, Po.",".

The question of the day is: Do you think that the Disney movies or Dreamworks movies are better? Which characters from these two franchises are your favorites?

I have to admit that I haven't been really into the Disney animated movies lately. They were really good, but I never really liked the cartoon series, because I found them to be too dark and they weren't very funny.

I haven't really been into the Dreamworks movies either. I didn't like their first movie, I thought it was a bit unbelievable and I found it a bit boring. They have made some really good movies since then though.

Cinderella was my favorite from the Disney movies - that's not surprising really, because I love Cinderella stories! She's such a great character and I think she's probably the most well-known character from the Disney movies - not so surprising either, I suppose!

Name some famous 20th century Russian composers.," The End of Elf Online is a story-driven action MMO with a deep story-driven world and a compelling, immersive combat system. Some of the most well-known composers are Sergey Prokofiev and Sergei Prokofiev. I don't recall much of what the music was about, but I do remember that it was very fast-paced, and I was left in awe of the skill of the musicians and composers.

The music has a very rich, and very complex, system of melodic lines that would be very difficult to learn. In the end, this is a great track to listen to while editing and fine-tuning your music with your favorite DAW. Dr. Evil, the evil villain of the Austin Powers movies, is played by a young Danny DeVito, and the music for the movie is composed by Greydon Square. The composer is known for his other works as well, including the music for the classic American Western ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""The Great Escape"" among others. I love the music of the end credits of the Austin Powers movies.

I used to have an old Pentium 4 laptop that I used for my music composition (a little bit of everything). I used to use Reason to write my music and was really happy with the result. I had to go back to the Windows 95 days when I had to use Windows 3.1 to write my music.

I love this topic. I've never really been a fan of the music from the movies. I'm more of a fan of the music in the books. I am a big fan of the soundtrack of the Indiana Jones movies and The Bourne movies. I love the music of the Bourne movies.

In the Dr. Evil movie, the music reminded me of the music in the Bourne movie, especially the score by Hans Zimmer and the score by J. Peter Robinson. The music in Bourne was very sci-fi and modern, but the music in Dr. Evil was a little more upbeat, but very modern.

I want to add that there are some composers I appreciate for the music they wrote. As a composer, I appreciate the work of William Orbit. I also appreciate the work of The Academy Award-winning composer Hans Zimmer.

What and how should you feed your baby?,": a feeding bottle that has a sensor of your baby's mouth as well as a rotating bottle that is gradually rotated while the baby is sucking from the bottle, thus allowing the baby to suck and swallow the feed at the same time. If the bottle is not turned, the baby will continue to suck the bottle while the mother is attempting to give the baby a bottle. How: This bottle has a sensor that is located at the side of the bottle that is placed in your baby's mouth. As your baby sucks on the bottle, the sensor is activated. As you rotate the bottle, the sensor detects the movement of the spout, which is what keeps the bottle rotating. As the bottle rotates, your baby is given a continuous rotation of liquid, and the sensor will turn off when the bottle is completely empty. If the bottle is not rotated, your baby will continue to suck on the bottle for a longer period of time, which can lead to your baby's teeth being damaged. The bottle's sensor will also turn off when the baby's lips get into contact with the bottle.

Why is","What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding.

It's intended to be a satire on hip-hop culture and the celebrity-worship that can become a destructive obsession for many people.

what is cricket and why is it popular in Asian countries?,", the most popular sport in the world, especially in countries like India and Pakistan, is cricket. In Cricket, the players, known as Cricketers, play against each other with a ball made of leather, wood, or plastic.

It’s a very fast-paced game, with lots of runs and the highest score possible being 200. Cricket is the national sport of some countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, West Indies, and other countries in Africa.

If you have a female in your family, chances are that you might be familiar with a popular game, like Bowling or Tennis. The rules of cricket are very simple: the ball, made of leather or wood, is bowled by the batsman, who is allowed to score points by hitting the ball over the bowler’s head. The bowler and the batsman can score points by hitting the ball on the ground, off the bat, or over the wicket, which is the fence on the field.

The game is played by two teams, and the rules allow each team to score one point each, one for a run, or one for a wicket. If one team scores more points than the other team, that team wins. If a team does not score a run or a wicket, then they lose.

As you can see, the rules of cricket are very simple. However, there are some rules that must be followed. If the umpire does not follow the rules, then the team will lose.

Cricket is an exciting sport, but it can also be very dangerous. If a batsman is in a bad mood or is angry, he might take out his anger on the ball. This is called “being nasty” and is not allowed.

The umpire must also not extend his arm beyond the boundary and must not move from the spot he is standing.

Another thing that must be followed is that if a ball is bowled at the batsman, he must not hit it. When a batsman is in trouble, he is allowed to hit the ball on the ground, but not the batsman.

Cricket is very popular in Asian countries, and it is usually played in large groups. If you are going to visit an Asian country, you should be very careful with the rules.

If you are going to be in India or Pakistan, you will see a","Cricket is one of the most popular sports in Asian countries. One of the worlds biggest cricket teams are India. The reason for so much popularity is multifold. Top reason is when English invaded South east asia they brought this game to the continent. Originally this game was only played by upper class, and later adopted by other classes as well. To play cricket you need one bat and one ball. Bat will be made up of wood and ball can be either tennis ball or hard ball which is made up of leather. You need a wicket which is 3 sticks and 2 bails on top. One person throws the ball and other person try to protect his wickets with the bat. The length of the wicket is 22 yards. Batsman can hit the ball for runs. To make runs, there are two ways. First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can. There are other ways to get runs as well, like if its a wide ball or no ball. For a team to win a match, they either have to make more runs then the other team",0.231693,0.998433,18.744098,0.991392,0.372051,4.267533,-4.424823760986328

"Given the following paragraph on gene regulation, what are operons and where do they occur?",": the gene regulation of a carboxylic acid utilization operon may be controlled at either the transcriptional or translational level.

Www.graduate.csuohio.edu/syllabi/ch12/ch12-7.shtml

As you answer the question, consider the role of RNA polymerase in transcription and where the sections of DNA that code for the RNA are located. A gene that is not expressed cannot be used for making something. Operon regulation is not the only means of controlling gene expression, however.

The DNA sequences in a promoter that control transcription initiation are called promoters. The DNA sequences that code for the RNA of a gene also are called the codons. In the case of an enzyme, the DNA that codes for the amino acid sequence of the protein is called the coding DNA sequence (CDS). You can think of the CDS as a part of the gene that codes for the protein itself.

Consider the following paragraph next to the figure of an operon. The mRNA that codes for the enzyme is the first part of an operon. The gene that codes for the enzyme is the second part.

Lorenz: a large concentration of a protein located in a cell is called a cell. The large concentration of the protein is called a protein complex. The protein complex is called a complex.

Www.graduate.csuohio.edu/syllabi/ch12/ch12-8.shtml

DNA is not the only part of a gene. Proteins also play an important role in gene expression. A protein is a complex of amino acids. The amino acids are called amino acids. Amino acids can be classified according to the characteristics of each of the amino acids. The amino acids that can be classified as positively charged are called positively charged amino acids.

Consider the following paragraph about the regulatory region of a gene. The DNA that codes for the CDS of the gene is called the coding DNA sequence (CDS). The DNA that codes for the RNA of the gene is called the regulatory DNA sequence (RDS). The DNA that codes for the protein is called the promoter DNA sequence (PDS). The DNA that codes for the RNA that is used in the initiation of the synthesis of the RNA is called the terminator DNA sequence (TDS).

What is black tie dress code?

Ets, one of the largest department stores in the United States, has been the subject of several major headlines recently, with store employees protesting the dress code policies.

The main issue is that the dress code at the store is enforced by members of the management, rather than by the employees. The employees want a dress code that is enforced by the employees, who have the actual experience of working in the store. (For more information about the events, see the links below.)

This protest was sparked by the fact that employees were being told to wear a dress code that was not enforced. The issue of dress code, and the employees' rights, was raised by the National Labor Relations Board.

The dress code is enforced by EtsCo, the company that manages the store. Some employees have complained that they feel that they are being forced to wear a dress code that does not reflect the actual experience of working in the store.

EtsCo is a for-profit company; they are not unionized, and they do not have a dress code. Some employees believe that they have the right to wear what they want, rather than what is enforced by EtsCo.

What types of political organizations did pre-colonial Africa have?,"ation of the peasantsThe political organization of the peasants in sub-Saharan Africa has been a fairly messy affair. The development of communalism in the form of the Bamana and sub-Saharan African were famous for their system of chiefs that managed the affairs of the villages and the political organization of the peasants. The history of the political organization of the peasants in Africa predates the colonial period by a few centuries. But the political system of the peasantry in Africa is a topic that has drawn much attention in recent years. After the colonial period, the political organization of the peasants in Africa underwent a dramatic change. From the post-colonial period, there has been much debate on the political organization of the peasants in Africa.

When talking about whether pre-colonial Africa had political organizations like those in Europe and the Americas, one should consider the question of what kinds of political organizations did pre-colonial Africa have? In Africa, there were various kinds of political organizations. Many of these organizations were similar to those in Europe and the Americas. However, there were some other organizations in Africa that were unique to pre-colonial Africa. These organizations were not similar to the political organizations in Europe and the Americas.

The most famous political organization in Africa was the Bamana system. This system was known for its political organization of the peasantry. The Bamana system was the first political system that was known to have been used in Africa. It was also one of the only political organizations in the pre-colonial period that was used to manage the affairs of the villages. The Bamana system was also the political organization of the peasants of the Zulu. In the Bamana system, the village chiefs were the political leaders of the peasants. The village chiefs were known as the mukutas. The mukutas were the political leaders of the peasantry. The mukutas had the authority to mediate disputes that occurred between peers. They also had the authority to punish those who had disobeyed the mukuta's orders. The village chief also had an important role in the administration of the Bamana system. The village chief was the head of the village council. The village council was the highest level of the Bamana political organization. The village council was made up of the mukuta, the village head, and the other members of the village council.

Another organization that existed in Africa was the system of the sub-Saharan African. This political organization used to be","Pre-colonial Africa had many political organizations including: small family groups, larger family clan groupings, heavily structured clan groups, and autonomous city-states and kingdoms.",0.126062,0.997163,26.711284,0.940488,0.161487,5.787297,-3.4086029529571533

Comment: Use a few short sentences to convey the information in the paragraph. You are now ready to write your first paragraph.

Writing Your First Paragraph: The Basics

Paragraphs are the most important part of any essay. We've already discussed the beginning of an essay, so now let's focus on the main event: the first paragraph. Here's where you begin to develop the general theme of your essay. A paragraph will be organized into a structure called a _topic sentence, transition sentence, and main idea._

Topic sentence: The topic sentence sets the stage for your topic. It gives your reader a sense of the subject matter of the paragraph and introduces the main idea of the essay.

Transition sentence: The transition sentence links the main idea to the rest of the paragraph. The transition sentence is one of the most important parts of the essay, because it introduces the topic sentence, and it sets the stage for the main idea.

Main idea: The main idea is the main idea of the paragraph. It should make the topic sentence, transition sentence, and the rest of the paragraph make sense to the reader.

As you can see, this is a very important part of your essay. Now let's break down each of these sections to be sure you understand them.

Topic sentence: The topic sentence is the sentence that introduces the topic of your essay. It should give your reader a general sense of the topic of your essay. You should use nouns and verbs.

Transition sentence: In this sentence, you will introduce the topic sentence and transition. It should be a sentence that comes after the topic sentence. In a transition sentence, you introduce the topic sentence and transition.

Main idea: In your essay, you will have a main idea and sub-points. The main idea is the main idea of the paragraph. It should be a sentence that makes the topic sentence, transition, and the rest of the paragraph make sense to the reader.

**_Tip_**

A rule of thumb is to stick with a topic sentence, transition sentence, and main idea. You can always use a transition sentence, but you will have to use","We live in a digital age.

How can you take good star photos?,": lhat’s the question. We’ve taken Star photos for years. We’re generally good at it. We have a great system. We go to our star list, we go to our star map map, we look where we are in our star map map, we look for the star—three, four, five—we find it, we get the star, then we look at the image in camera, we look at the image in the viewfinder, we look at the image in the screen, we look at the image in the monitor, and we try to figure out what we’re going to do with it. And typically, we find it. We find it very quickly, because we have a good system. We try to figure out what we’re going to do with it. It’s a science. It’s not magic. It’s a science. So it’s not easy. It’s not easy, but it’s a science. And then you try to figure out how to use it, and then you do it. So it’s not easy. But it’s a science, and it takes time. But it’s a science.

Star photos are especially important when you’re taking a star photo for your session.

Theb: You’ve seen a lot of star photos. How do you decide when you take a star photo?

Jf: Well, it depends on the star. It depends on what we want to do with the star. If it’s a star that we’re going to use for black and white, we’ll take the star photo. We’ll take the dark scene. We’ll take the image that’s in the viewfinder. We’ll try to get as much detail as possible. That’s a good star to use. If we’re not going to use it for black and white, if we’re going to use it for color—in color, we’ll use the image in the viewfinder. The image on the screen. That’s one way to use a star photo. If we’re not sure, we’ll take it in the viewfinder. We’ll take the image that’s on the screen. You’ll have to decide which approach you’re going to take.

Theb: Do you think that a professional photographer would be able to tell the difference between a star photo and","Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky",0.361337,0.958898,27.370245,0.990525,0.391271,6.014455,-3.747375011444092
I want to develop OKRs for my team at work. What process should I use?,"ter's Oct 12, 2014 #05 I have been using OKRs for several years at my current company and it has been a great success. My team meets with me once a month to discuss how we are progressing and, based on that, we make our OKRs. What I like about it is that it gives us the opportunity to discuss and share our progress with each other. It also gives us the chance to share any concerns we might have with each other that the OKR doesn't cover. There's no one best approach to OKRs, though. Use what works well for your team. I am currently a consultant that works with other startups on OKRs, and we have a very different approach to the process. My approach is more about setting goals and tracking progress than it is about getting everyone on the same page. It's about productivity and common sense, not about OKRs. Let's get to work. Oct 12, 2014 #03 I am in the process of forming an OKR team at my company and would like to solicit the opinions of those who have done this before. I do not have a business background or any experience with OKRs. I am hoping that some of you can suggest some good practices that you have used in the past and share your experiences. Oct 12, 2014 #02 It's definitely a team process, though I would also think that it is a team responsibility to set goals and objectives. It's not a one-man show. I have seen a few OKRs on this forum, and they're all very similar. A couple of them have a fairly detailed list of OKR items, including a budget for each category. What happens in the event of a team member who doesn't meet their goals? I see this as a good opportunity to get them to understand that it is important to set goals. I personally have never seen a team member say, ""I don't have time to do OKR."" They might feel that they don't have time, but a lot of them would. They might be willing to look at the OKR items and figure out how they can work on them. I don't think it's a big deal to spend a couple of minutes to answer this question. Oct 12, 2014

Oct 12, 2014 #01 I've used OKRs and I love them. They work better when you have a clear goal and objective. When I started using them, I didn't know what to expect. I was told that it was a simple process to set goals","Developing OKRs for your team is a useful way to identify what goals your team will focus on and provide specific, time-bound metrics you can use to measure your success. First, identify the most important objectives for your organization - usually no more than five. Next, identify your Key Results. These Key Results should follow the SMART principles. They should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Once you have identified both your objectives and key results, share them with your team for their input. Once you have collected that input, finalize your OKRs and roll them out to the team through the appropriate communications channel.",0.013289,0.995683,23.574072,0.984185,0.009837,5.115413,-3.2495198249816895

Who was the first girl from a New Jersey hamlet to go to Paris? Who was the first girl from a New Jersey hamlet to go to Paris who also spoke French? Who will be the first girl from a New Jersey hamlet to go to Paris who also speaks French?

The answer: It was Deloris Van Cartier, who lived in Delfont, New Jersey. She was born in 1886 and was 15 when she joined the ""Rouge et Noir"" troupe of actors and singers. The troupe was made up of French and American actors and singers who toured the French provinces.

She was considered one of the most beautiful women in France. She was even sought out by the French royal family. While in Paris, she began to learn English. She spoke it so well that she was hired by a New York actor to work in Broadway shows. In 1907 she married a man named Walter. She moved to New York City and divorced him.

But Deloris was not content to be just an actress. She began to write plays. She was even considered for the role of ""Madame Gautreau"" in ""The Jilts"". She was so successful that she was even considered for the role of Sarah Bernhardt. But it was not to be.

When she was 21, Deloris moved back to New Jersey. She was a teacher in her hometown, but she soon decided to go back to acting. She went to the Metropolitan Opera House and once again was considered for the role of Madame Gautreau. But this time, she was refused because she was too old. But she was able to win the role of ""Lola Montez"" in an opera production.

In 1918, she married a Frenchman, Henri Guillaume, who was the man who put her on the cover of Life magazine. She was the only woman from the New Jersey hamlet to be on the cover of the magazine, but the only woman who was not French. She had to work hard to get on the cover, though. She would have to pose nude.

The last time she appeared on the cover of a magazine was in 1979 when she was on the cover of the New Jersey Monthly.

"In Frank Herbert's Dune novel, why is the spice valuable?","il is an extremely valuable spice, but it is mainly so because it improves the quality of the melange. The melange is a mix of spice and water that is used in the spice-making process. The spice is added to the melange, and the melange becomes a ""better"" melange. For example, the spice may be added to increase the amount of the melange; the water may be added to increase the flavor of the melange; or the spice may be added to the melange to alter the flavor of the melange. The spice may also be added to the melange to decrease the amount of the melange.
This process is known as ""tampering."" Many of the spice-making operations are ""tamperings"" in that they are used to alter the spice. However, the basic spice-making operation is to mix spice and water together to make a melange. A spice-making operation is not usually a ""tampering,"" since the melange is not changed in the process.

The spice-making process is highly complicated. For example, in the spice-making process, a melange is made by first combining all of the spice with all of the water. Then, several of the components are removed. These components are called ""bits."" In the spice-making process, the bits are removed by adding the spice to the water and then removing the water. In other words, the spice and water are ""tampered"" together. The spice is added to the water, and then the water is removed. The water, of course, is discarded.

The spice-making process is well-known, and it is one of the most complex chemical processes known. However, the spice-making process is not the only process that is used to make spice. When the spice-making process is used, the spice may be made from another type of spice. The spice-making process is used in many processes. For example, the spice-making process is used in the process of making Melange.

The spice-making process is also used in the process of making dune melange. The spice-making process is used to make the spice, which is called ""concentrate."" The concentrate is the ingredient that is used to make the Melange. The term ""concentrate"" is not used to describe the spice itself. Instead, a spice-making operation is called a ""concentrate-making operation""","The spice is valuable because it is a scarce resource that is crucial to interstellar travel.

The practice of photography is about more than simply capturing a moment in time. It is about creating a visual record of a moment in time. It is about using the camera to tell the story of a person, place, or thing and then preserving the story in a usable form.

Photography is the art and science of capturing the visual record of a person, place, or thing through the use of a camera. The term “photography” is the result of a combination of the Greek words “photo” (“picture”) and “graphy” (“writing”). More specifically, the word “photography” was first used in 1839 when English poet Lord Byron wrote the lines: “Caught in the act, she did not plead/And I did not beg.”

"Tell me whether these are mammals or amphibians: rats, cats, dogs,  frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, caecilians, deer, monkeys, apes, bats, whales, dolphins, and humans."," Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment.

Causes

The cause of R. suverica is unknown. The only known cause of R. suverica is the population of the host, D. coriacea. D. coriacea is a parasite that is endemic to the eastern and western United States. They are found from New York to North Carolina. The parasite is a larval cestode that is found in the gills of D. coriacea. The parasite is an egg that is passed out in the feces of the host. The larval stage of the parasite is called a ""cestode"" because the larva has a relatively complex body that resembles a cestode. Cestodes are one of three main stages of the tapeworm parasite. The larval stages of R. suverica are called ""tapeworms"" because they are tape shaped.

Symptoms

The symptoms of R. suverica depend on the host and the stage of the parasite. The symptoms of R. suverica are not typically recognizable in the host because the host will show no signs of illness. The symptoms do vary depending on the stage of the parasite. In an uninfected host, R. suverica can remain dormant in the host for years. However, once the parasite is ingested, it will mature in the host and begin to grow. The symptoms of a mature R. suverica depend on the stage of the parasite. In an adult R. suverica, the symptoms can include digestive disorders. In a larval R. suverica, the symptoms will include inflammation of the gills, usually in the gills of the fish. In a juvenile R. suverica, the symptoms will include digestive disorders and inflammation of the gills.

Treatment

The treatment of R. suverica depends on the stage of the parasite. In an uninfected host, the treatment is prevention. In a larval R. suverica, the treatment is prevention. In an adult R. suverica, the treatment is removal of the parasite. The parasites can be removed by hand or by using a knife. It is recommended that the host be treated in the same manner.

What is March Madness?,"aryMarch Madness is an annual competition for college football teams representative of different conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Big East, and Pac-10). In the 2016–17 season, the Big Ten had the top seed in the tournament, while the other four conference champions (ACC, Big 12, Big East, and Pac-10) were given at-large berths as well.

Think up a bunch of different meals I can make that include potatoes.," For this recipe, you can use one of the following potatoes:* Yukon gold potatoes (or their French name, paupiettes) would make a great base for this recipe. Yukon gold potatoes have a mild flavor, so they're great for dishes like this one, and they can be used in salads and soups, or even as a side dish for cheese dishes. I like to use Yukon Golds because they're not as starchy as russets and they're more tender and easier to carve.Shredded potatoes also work well, but russets are a little more starchy. They have a slight chewier texture that's more characteristic of potatoes. The ""starchiness"" of potatoes is a matter of how much or how little moisture they're exposed to when they're cut. When you cut potatoes, the moisture they contain is released into the air, and it can get trapped in the cut. If they're exposed to too much moisture, they'll hold it too tightly in the cut and become starchy. If they're exposed to too little moisture, they'll hold it too loosely in the cut and become rubbery.Healthy potatoes ""starchier"" than their starchy cousins, russets, are sometimes referred to as ""steaming potatoes"" because they'll steam up if you leave them in a pan for too long. These potatoes are great when they're cooked in water with a pinch of sea salt added to them. Potatoes, like most foods, will have a mild taste if they come from a healthy source, but if they're over-processed, they'll carry a stronger taste.If you use russets, you can use them as a base for this recipe, but you'll need to grate them yourself, or you can use the bagged potato slices you get at the supermarket. If you're using russets, you can use just about any kind of cheese with these potatoes—I used Parmesan.Half-moons are the most common way to cut potatoes. If you want to cut your potatoes into larger or smaller pieces, you can do it by cutting them into quarters, quarters, or halves. I recommend using either the knife or the mandolin slicer for the best results.Making this potato cake is really easy. You just need to slice your potatoes into nice, even-sized pieces. You could also dice them into cubes, but this will give you a more rounded potato cake that's easier to eat.I","Potatoes are a very versatile food that can be used in many meals.

What type of pokemon should I use to battle a water pokemon? Give me some examples.,". What is the most efficient way to take down a gym leader? Give me some examples.

I am using a Wonder Guard and a Wally that I use as a sandstorm. I think I use both properly. I had an example of maybe using the sandstorm to get around the rain and stronger pokemon on the lower area.

Aside from the methods mentioned above, there is a Healing Sphere method, which is to hold down the button until it heals you.

What type of pokemon should I use to battle a water pokemon? Give me some examples.

It would depend on the water type. If it's a water-type and you have a Water-type attack, then you would use a water-type. If it's a water-type and you have a Fire-type attack, then you would use a fire-type. If it's a water-type and you have a Grass-type attack, then you would use a grass-type.

What is the most efficient way to take down a gym leader? Give me some examples.

Depends on the gym leader, but I would say you can't take out the leader with a single attack. I don't know what move it is, but the most efficient way to do this is to have a strong attack and a support move that's good against the leader. It's probably not going to be the most efficient, but it's the most effective.

Aside from the methods mentioned above, there is a Healing Sphere method, which is to hold down the button until it heals you.

Subject:  MLSP


I was wondering if the Portland office could get together to discuss the 
following:

1. What is the current status of the MLSP?  Who is doing what?
2.  What is the plan for getting the MLSP up and running?
3.  How will the MLSP be administered?  Who would be responsible for each 
division?  How would we coordinate our activities?
4.  How would the MLSP be funded?
5.  Who has the authority to make the final decisions regarding the MLSP?
6.  Is it possible to have a stand alone MLSP?

Please let me know if you are interested in attending.","1. Portland, Oregon's governance is built on a city commission system.

"Discuss ways in which brands in your industry (or industry of your choice) could benefit from the web's gift to measurement: ""the ability to fail faster. At a low cost."" Provide at least one example supporting your ideas",".

The trouble with this is that the way we consume media today for marketing is very different from the way it was in the past, and that the way we consume media today will probably change even more in the future. It will be increasingly difficult to determine the real value of a product or service that is only being shown to a few dozen people or even less.

I can understand this difficulty, but there are ways to mitigate it. I have no problem with the idea of measuring the value of a product or service that is being shown to a large audience, even if I am not sure how many people are actually seeing it.

The trouble is that the way we measure the value of advertising today is not the same as the way it was when the first ad was run in a newspaper. Advertising has changed in both the technology it uses and the platform it is displayed on. It has changed in the medium in which it is delivered, but it has also changed in the way it is measured.

For example, the number of times an ad is displayed has changed. Displayed on a website, the ad typically gets seen by far fewer people than it would if it were displayed on a billboard or on the side of a bus. The number of times an ad is viewed has also changed. Advertisers are increasingly using the power of algorithms to target advertising to people who are most likely to be interested in a particular product or service.

In short, the measurements we use to determine the value of advertising have changed, and it is very difficult to determine the value of a product or service that is only being shown to a few dozen people or even less.

I will be the first to admit that I am not an expert on measuring advertising value. But I do know that many businesses and organizations are failing to measure or understand the value of their marketing. This is what I want to talk about (and why I started the measurement challenge), so I want to understand what the measurement of advertising is like today.

Websites and Advertising

The first thing that I want to point out is that the measurement of advertising value today does not compare like to like. A website is an investment in people's time; a website is a marketing channel. It is not just a way to deliver a message to people, it is a way to influence people's behavior. The website can be seen as a form of advertising that is not paid for, and so the measurement of its value","Kia Carnival is a new MPV (multi-purpose vehicle) 7-seater minivan directly competing with the industry leaders like Honda Odyssey, Toyota Sienna, and Chrysler Pacifica. Kia Carnival faces an uphill battle against the industry leader to gain market share. Kia Carnival can perform a small, low-cost experiment to measure consumer outcomes, customer value, and attribution to increase sales and optimize its spending on digital marketing.   

The minivan buyers typically visit the Kia Carnival website, engage in a vehicle build configurator, and perform inventory checks to get an overview of the vehicle and price. Post this, the buyers will check YouTube videos and Twitter reviews and visit a Kia dealership store if the buyer shortlists Carnival.   

Kia can start measuring the micro-conversions along the buyer journey by tracking the website page views; car configuration clicks, inventory views, and video views on the Kia YouTube channel. These data points",0.216055,0.993853,17.210936,0.994048,0.196965,3.922372,-3.694709539413452

One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, ""I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.""  Having this love for another is a key factor in why it is special to be a grandparent.",0.395637,0.989045,30.780997,0.984274,0.372823,6.704555,-4.522947788238525

The tide had come in and the sun was gone, but the water was still as dark as night and the pirates were still on the move. Those who still lived held their breath as they looked at the river. They had heard the stories and seen the pictures of the pirates before they had set out from the village of Jawalak to look for something on the other side of the river. The captain of the ship had said they would be able to see the pirates through the night, but they had not. They had come as close as they had ever come to finding the pirates and finding their treasure. They had worked hard all day to get here and they would not fail.

They had been told that the pirates had robbed them because they did not have the money to pay them for the meat they had brought with them. The pirates had turned away them and taken everything they had, but they had not been able to find what they were looking for. The captain had said that they would find the pirates and the treasure if they were willing to look for it. They had worked hard all day and were not willing to give up now. They had all searched before and had found nothing, but they would not give up now. They would find the treasure they were looking for and they would not give up.

The stars had been so bright that it had even been possible to see them on the water. The stars had been so bright that the pirates could see the land a long way out on the other side of the river.

Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner’s and other faults and chose to",0.474353,0.993837,17.180632,0.999184,0.518863,4.033374,-2.815896511077881

","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.959058,0.997968,22.84344,0.998342,0.992671,5.358296,-3.0831501483917236

The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders).

When did Arsenal first reach the first division? How many league titles did they win between 1989 and 2005 and how many FA cups? How many trophies in total for that period?,"2d0

September:

If you've been following the team at all, you'll know that Arsenal have reached the FA Cup final before. In fact, they are the only team in the history of the competition to have done so. The Arsenal teams of the early 1990s are remembered for their defensive solidity and 'no-nonsense' approach. They won the double in 1992/93 and also finished as runners-up in the 1994/95 season.

In 1990, Arsenal became the first team to win the FA Cup after losing the final in their first year in the top flight. In 1993, they won it again after losing the final the year before. They were the first team ever to win the FA Cup as a third tier side and went on to win the league title. This was in the years before the Premier League came along.

In 1997 they lost the final again, this time to Manchester United. Arsenal were only able to win the FA Cup because Manchester United's loss of form meant that they made the final against the defending champions.

At the end of the 1997/98 season, Arsenal were the first team to win the double in both the FA Cup and the league. In 1998/99 they went one better again, winning the double again.

In 2001, Arsenal became the first team to win the Double in both the FA Cup and the league. It is still the only time that this has happened.

In 2002, Arsenal became the first team to win the Double in the league and FA Cup. Arsenal also won the league title that season, their first since the early 1990s.

At the end of the 2003/04 season, Arsenal won the Double for the second time in the club's history, making this the third time the club has won the Double. The first two were in the early 1990s.

In 2004, Arsenal became the first team to win the Double in both the league and FA Cup. The club's most recent Double was in the early 1990s.

In 2005, Arsenal became the first team to win the Double in the league and FA Cup. The club's most recent Double was in the early 1990s.

On the pitch, we can see that Arsenal are one of the best defensive teams in the country. The club was one of the first in the league to adopt a system based on defensive solidity and dominance. Arsenal's style has stuck around ever since and has become a staple of","Arsenal reached the first division in 1904. Between 1989 and 2005, Arsenal won 5 league titles and 5 FA cups.

An infant is crying because it is hungry.

You can learn about the causes of infant crying in the Baby Care section of this page.

","The first thing to check is if your baby is hungry. It’s by far the most common reason they cry. You can tell if they’re hungry by lightly touching their cheek and seeing if they have a “rooting” reflex. This is where they open their mouth and turn towards your touch, as if they were looking for the source of food.

If they’re not hungry, they’re possibly tired. Babies can become over tired and cry and fuss, even when you are just trying to get them to sleep. If this is the case you’ll need to calm them down first, and then you can get them to sleep.

Finally sometimes babies just cry for no reason. Isn’t parenting fun?",0.999256,0.947187,3.984631,0.991021,0.999197,1.584258,-7.592449188232422

The bay is a deep basin, surrounded by hills. The hills would have served to shield any ship that traversed the bay from the direct effects of fog, or strong winds.
The floor of the bay is only a few feet above sea level, leaving the bay below it - free of hills, and thus exposed to the effects of strong winds. Therefore, ships were required to travel around the bay to reach the water below it, which is at a much lower elevation than the Bay itself.
The first ship to traverse the bay was the Baltimore, built in 1790. It was built with a deck on both sides of the ship, which allowed for cargo to be unloaded aft, and cargo to be loaded forward. This allowed the ship to sail in a straight line along the bay. By the time the first ship was built, the bay was a military port, so the cargo was primarily military supplies, and the ship was designed to carry a maximum number of soldiers.
The next ship to traverse the bay was the USS San Francisco, built in 1846. It was a steam-powered ship, and it was built to carry a maximum number of military supplies. Prior to that, the only way to traverse the bay was by water.
The San Francisco served during the Mexican-American War, and the Civil War. It was decommissioned in 1863, and re-commissioned in 1866 to serve in the Civil War. In 1869, it was decommissioned again, and sold to a private owner. It was eventually scuttled in the bay in 1875.
The last ship to traverse the Bay before the opening of the Golden Gate was the SS Great Western, built in 1883. It was a wooden ship, and it was built to carry a maximum number of passengers. It was not a fast ship, and the cost of building it was astronomical. It was eventually scuttled in the bay in 1909.

","The only (practical) way to get across the San Francisco Bay prior to 1937 was by Ferry. The Golden Gate Ferry Company, which became the largest ferry operation by the late 1920's, was established in 1867 as the Sausalito Land & Ferry Company. The ferry would take approximately 20 minutes and cost $1.00 per vehicle.",0.526026,0.998555,19.500282,0.978783,0.440848,4.488899,-3.805997610092163

Did Gary Collins played in the NHL,"ier league in the mid-1970s?

There are a lot of players who played in the NHL in the 1970s who left the league after their prime. Names like Gary Collins, Red Berenson, and Dennis Hull are just three that come to mind.

Collins was a member of the Boston Bruins for 10 seasons. He also played in the World Hockey Association with the Quebec Nordiques for five seasons. He was a member of the NHL All-Rookie Team in 1970 after scoring 21 goals and 55 points in just 54 games. He would play in the NHL again with four teams in the 1970s, including the New York Islanders and the Bruins. Collins retired from the NHL in 1982, but returned in the AHL in 1984.

Red Berenson played four seasons in the NHL with the Montreal Canadiens, Los Angeles Kings, and St. Louis Blues. In his rookie season with the Canadiens in 1968-69, he scored 26 goals and 60 points in 73 games. He was a member of the NHL All-Rookie Team and played in the World Hockey Championships in 1969. He played in the NHL again in 1970-71 with the Los Angeles Kings, scoring thirty-eight goals and 51 points in seventy-nine games. He played in the NHL for the final time with the St. Louis Blues in 1972-73, scoring twenty-eight goals and sixty-four points in seventy-six games. He was a member of the NHL All-Rookie Team in 1970-71.

Dennis Hull played two seasons in the NHL with the Washington Capitals, New York Islanders, and New Jersey Devils. He spent the majority of his career in the AHL, playing with the Hershey Bears, Norfolk Admirals, Chicago Cougars, and New Haven Nighthawks. He played in the NHL again in 1994-95, scoring five goals and eleven points in twenty-one games with the New Jersey Devils.

Michigan was the first team outside of the NHL to win a title in the NCAA tournament. In their first season in the tournament, Michigan defeated Wisconsin and Ohio State in the East Regional Final. They would go on to win the NCAA championship, defeating the University of Denver in the championship game. The tournament was canceled due to the outbreak of the Vietnam War. Michigan was the last team to win the NCAA championship until the University of Florida won the NCAA championship in 2010.

Does a difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups from a credit scoring algorithm constitute a bias in the data collection process or the algorithm itself?,"ium's blog on the matter.

The answer to this question is that it depends on who your audience is. There are some characteristics of a credit scoring algorithm that are clear-cut, such as gender and ethnicity:

Gender: A gender bias in a credit scoring algorithm is obvious because, in general, women are known to be more cautious in their credit repayments than men are.

Ethnicity: Ethnicity is difficult to define precisely, but it generally refers to a person's culture or background. Someone who was born in another country will not have the same cultural background as someone born in the UK.

It's important to remember that a credit scoring algorithm does not have to be biased against women or non-white people.

Does it matter where the data comes from?

The data from which a credit scoring algorithm is built is not the only thing that can affect the outcome. There are several other factors that can affect the outcome, and that's where it gets a little tricky.

For example, a credit scoring algorithm might be built using data from a reputable credit bureau, such as Equifax or Experian.

However, these credit bureaus have a significant amount of data on people who are not at all in default, such as people with good credit histories.

This means that if the data from these credit bureaus is used to build a credit scoring algorithm, it will probably not be as accurate as if the data is sourced from credit card companies, or banks, or other companies.

The other factor that can affect the outcome is the quality of the data used for the algorithm.

The data used to build a credit scoring algorithm can be based on a credit card payment history, or the repayment history of a loan, or it can be based on the credit rating of an individual.

The quality of the data used to build the algorithm determines the accuracy of the outcome.

Does it matter if the credit scoring algorithm is used to predict whether someone will be approved for a loan or not?

In a nutshell, the answer is yes.

When you apply for a loan, the lender uses the credit scoring algorithm to determine whether or not you are approved for the loan.

The algorithm does not determine whether you will be approved for the loan.

The lender uses the algorithm to decide whether you are eligible for the loan.

This means that a credit scoring algorithm should not be used to","I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in",0.127435,0.996076,19.156188,0.850163,0.109192,4.247811,-5.085460662841797

Before the invention of the electrical device, children were required to memorize multiplication tables, one of the most basic skills. The only way they could count on remembering is to use their hands to count the number of objects in a row. It was thought that their hands and fingers would retain the knowledge because of the constant use of the fingers in counting. This is a myth.

The reason for this myth is that the brain is not designed for memorization. The brain is simply not designed to remember twenty-six times twenty-six. In fact, by the time children reach the age of six, their brains are not even designed to remember anything.

The skill children use to count is called _rote learning._ It is a way of memorizing that involves rote repetition. Children will count objects a hundred times in a row until they have memorized the number. Then they will count them a hundred more times in the same way. It works, but it is not a skill the brain is designed to use.

The typical adult can count to about two hundred. If you ask most adults, they will not be able to count beyond twenty-two.

_Rote learning_ is not a skill children should use to learn multiplication. There are other ways to learn multiplication.

Here are three strategies that you can use to memorize:

Jeremy Corbyn.

Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the United Kingdom Labour Party, is a political figure and activist who has been the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Islington North since 1983. He became the first openly gay politician to lead a major British political party in 1994. He was also the first member of the Labour Party to speak out against the Iraq War when he was Minister for the Armed Forces from 1997-2002. After becoming the leader of the Labour Party in 2015, he has been a vocal opponent of the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union, and has called for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union.

Jeremy Corbyn was born in Denbigh, Wales, on September 10, 1940. His mother was a teacher and his father a coal miner. His parents were both Roman Catholics. Corbyn’s own upbringing and family life has been the subject of much controversy. He has been accused of being a “spoilt brat” due to his privileged upbringing. His elder brother, who died of cancer in 1995, once remarked that “Jeremy is not as good as he should be. He was a spoilt brat. He was sent to boarding school when he was a boy. I was sent to a boarding school at the age of 14. You are not a spoilt child if you’re sent to boarding school.”

Corbyn grew up as part of the Labour Party’s left-wing faction, and was active in the Labour Party in the 1970s. He became a Labour Member of Parliament in 1983, and was elected to the Islington North seat again in 1992. He was a member of the Labour Party’s front bench from 1994 to 2015, and was the Leader of the Labour Party from 2015 until his resignation on September 4, 2016. He resigned as the leader of the Labour Party following the resignation of the party’s other leadership. Corbyn, who is a member of the Labour Party’s left-wing faction, has also been a vocal opponent of the United Kingdom’s membership in the European Union (EU), and has called for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the EU.

By 1921, he had completed the development of the park's main features, including the landscaped reservoir and picnic grounds, and had begun work on a new section of the park. The park, named for Pullman, was dedicated in 1925. The park's 165 acres are located in the city's western suburbs, with the main access road running through the park on the border of Chicago's northern and southern suburbs. The park, which is also known as the Pullman City and Suburban Park, is open to the public seven days a week from dawn to dusk. The park is located near the intersection of I-57 and I-294.

I-57 has been a major artery of western suburban traffic for decades. While the interstate was originally planned to provide a freeway for Chicago, the route was redesigned to provide more access to existing communities. However, the interstate has become more of a fringe route, particularly for suburban commuters, since it only serves a small number of communities. As a result, traffic congestion along the interstate has become a major problem along the park. In 1996, the park was included in a study of the state's best places to live. The study noted that the park's proximity to the city and the Illinois Tollway, as well as the many public transportation options in the area, made it a desirable place to live.

Write a consoling message to my friend who didn’t get the job they wanted," on the account.

Was it necessary to make a complaint?

No.

But why?

In our culture, there is a very strong social obligation to complain. We make a big deal about complaining, and people who complain are admired.

When you look at it that way, it makes sense to complain. It also makes sense to not complain.

We live in a culture of complaining. Complaining is an old tradition. The 60s and 70s introduced the idea that complaining makes people better. And people who complain are better people.

Complaining is a great tool. It gets you noticed, and it gets you money.

But is it required?

No.

Complaining is not required in every situation. If you’re given a small amount of money, you’re not going to complain. You’re not going to whine and complain. You’re going to do the job.

But if you’re given a large amount of money, perhaps a house, you’re going to complain.

It’s not required.

But it’s required in a lot of cases?

No.

But if complaining is not required, why do we make it such a big deal?

It’s a very old tradition. When someone offers you something, you can say no. You can refuse. You can say, “No, thank you.”

In the old days, when you were offered something, you were expected to say, “yes.”

But that’s not really true anymore.

Yes, but that’s not really true anymore.

Because of the culture of complaining, it’s very hard to refuse. And so, we have to do it.

If you refuse, we call you a pig.

So you’re saying that complaining is not required but it is preferred?

Yes.

How much money is too much?

There are no rules.

How many times must you complain?

There are no rules.

Why is it so hard to refuse?

Because of the culture of complaining.

What’s the worst thing you could complain about?

The worst thing I could complain about is that I’m not entitled to anything.

What are the rules?

Complaining is not required, but it is preferred.

Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms.

Based on the following passage what is alternating current affected by?,"It deals with the problems of alternating current and electromagnetism.

Magnetism: Electromagnetism is an attempt to explain the physical world around us based on the idea of the electromagnetic force. The force of electromagnetism is the same force that holds a magnet in the iron ring. We see this force when a magnet passes a current through the iron ring.The current in the ring spins the iron ring around and the magnet stays still.

There are two types of electrical charge: positive and negative. An electric charge is a movement of positive and negative electrical charge.

An electric field is the presence of positive and negative electrical charge. It is a type of force. It is a force that pulls on a positively charged object and pushes on a negatively charged object. The force of the electric field is equal to the amount of electrical charge.

The electric field is always in the same direction as the direction of the electric charge. The electromagnetic force is the same as the electric force, but opposite in direction.

Magnetism: The magnetic force is the opposite of the electric force. It is attractive and pulls on a negatively charged object and repels on a positively charged object. The magnetic force is always in the same direction as the direction of the magnetic field.

The magnetic field is a type of force and the force of the magnetic field is equal to the amount of magnetic charge. In other words, the magnetic field is the movement of magnetic charge.

Cannabis Oil

Posted by: Anne on May 16, 2018

Are you suffering from a chronic condition, such as diabetes? Cannabis oil could be the answer. Cannabis oil is extracted from the marijuana plant. It is often used in the form of a tincture, which is a concentrated extract of the dried plant. Tinctures are usually used in the form of a dropper or a dropper bottle. Tinctures are often prescribed to people who suffer from a variety of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. Cannabis oil is considered to be a low-THC plant, which means that it contains little to no levels of THC. By using cannabis oil, you can reduce your need for the prescription medication that is prescribed to you for your chronic condition. You can also reduce your dependence on prescription medication.

Another benefit of using cannabis oil is that it can be used to help manage a number of chronic conditions, such as diabetes. It is often called a “miracle plant” because it has been used for many centuries as an alternative to prescription medication. Cannabis oil is often recommended for people who suffer from a variety of chronic conditions, and it is also often recommended for people who live with a chronic condition. Cannabis oil is one of the few plants that can be used for its mood-stabilizing and pain-relieving qualities. Diabetics who use cannabis oil often find that they have less anxiety and panic attacks. Cannabis oil is often used to help manage symptoms of diabetes. It is also used to treat the side effects of diabetes. The main side effects of diabetes are nerve damage and pain.

A study published in 2015 found that cannabis oil was effective in reducing ulcers caused by diabetes. The study was conducted on 50 people with diabetes. Half of the participants were placed in a group that used cannabis oil. The other half of the participants were placed in a group that used a placebo. The participants in the placebo group were given a sugar pill that was administered at the same time as the cannabis oil. The study found that the participants in the cannabis oil group had less pain and discomfort. The study also found that the participants were able to reduce the amount of pain medication they were prescribed. The study concluded that cannabis oil is effective in reducing the symptoms associated with diabetes.

It is also believed that cannabis oil can help manage Type 2 Diabetes. Type 2 Diabetes is also called","Two items are needed for successful management of Type 1 Diabetes. A way to monitor blood sugar levels and a way to administer insulin. 

Blood sugar monitoring is done either using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) device or with a blood sugar monitoring device where a small blood sample is required in order to measure the amount of sugar in the blood.

Why is Steph Curry such a good basketball player?,"ously asked.

That's a good question, and you may be interested in this article, which goes into detail on why the best basketball players are also good businessmen, and how they get paid for their skills. It's a pretty interesting read, so I highly recommend it.

Let's start with the top three NBA players ever:

Wilt Chamberlain was one of the most prolific scorers ever. He averaged over 40 points per game for 13 years in a row, and he was the first player to ever average at least 50 points per game. He also scored over one point per second for 20 years, and his career high was 56 points on March 28, 1962.

Magic Johnson is the best player of all time. He is the NBA's all-time scoring leader with 22,932 points. He also holds the record for most points in an NBA game, with a record-setting 18 points in a game on March 23, 1977.

Kareem Abdul Jabbar is the NBA's all-time scoring leader and the fourth-best player ever. He's the all-time leader in rebounds, blocks, and steals, as well as the league's leader in scoring, blocks and steals.

Now, let's look at the best basketball players in the world:

Luis Suarez, soccer player. He was the leading scorer in the World Cup this year, and he is currently on the top of the Formula One Alonso Trophy. He is also the best soccer player in the world, and he's the leading goal scorer in the Premier League. He's also a really good soccer player.

I'm trying to get creative with my grocery shopping.

I've made it a point to shop at Kroger more frequently and my local grocery store has tons of great deals.

This is Part 1 of 5 in a series about the items we have in our pantry that can be used to make a delicious, healthy and easy meal.

Meal Prep is a simple way to cut down on your grocery budget by preparing food ahead of time. Recipes are printed on an index card and you simply peel off the recipe card. Each recipe is designed to be an easy, healthy meal that can be made in about 30 minutes.

You can also use this meal plan as a guideline for your meal plan. In Part 2 of this series, I'll share some suggestions for snacks.

Now, let's get started!

1. Waffles

This is a great snack to bring along with you when you go out. There are so many different varieties of waffles you can make.

When we used to eat waffles as a family, we would get waffles from Dunkin Donuts. I recently found out Dunkin Donuts has a frozen waffle product now.

Dunkin Donuts is also one of the best places to buy frozen waffles. They carry a variety of different flavors. I love baking my waffles in a toaster oven. You can also bake them in a toaster oven.

2. Baked Batter

This is another one of my favorite snacks.

It's easy to make and doesn't require any cooking skills. I just mix the ingredients and then put it in the oven. You can eat it as is or top with your favorite ingredients.

I love this recipe because I can make a lot of different flavors.

3. Baked Biscuits

I love baked biscuits and gravy! This recipe is easy to make and it's super delicious.

You can add a little extra butter to your biscuits to make them extra delicious.

Write a story about a toddler who woke up in the middle of the night after a nightmare about a monster under their bed.,", age 2, woke from a nightmare to find a monster under the bed. She screamed and screamed but her parents could not wake her up. She woke up just in time to see the monster get up and run away. He was so scared that he ran over her toes.

Now when I heard the story, my first thought was that it was just a childish nightmare. But it wasn't. It was a nightmare that kept coming back to haunt this child. This monster was really trying to hurt her. The parents were trying to help her but it was too late. The monster was always trying to get her to go back to sleep.

There is a simple solution to this type of nightmare, but it is one that is not easy to implement.

First, you need to explain to the child that she is safe. The most helpful statement I've heard to explain why this happened is, ""The monster is not real."" The child needs to hear this statement repeated several times.

Then, you need to take her to the safety of your bed. When the child is safe in bed, and is able to fall asleep, the monster will stop coming back to hurt her.

This is the hardest part of the solution, but it is an easy solution to the problem. The child needs to know that she is safe.

You can call it a sleepover for the monster if you like, but it will probably take only one visit with the monster to the safety of your bed to put the monster to sleep.

Often, the monster is the child's imaginary friend. This is a very common cause of nightmares. The child is all alone in the dark, and then the monster comes and tries to make things worse.

The best way to keep the monster away is to take the child to his or her safety.

If the child talks about having this imaginary friend, it is more likely that the child is dealing with an intense fear. It is important to point out that the monster can be a real person, a person that the child perceives as evil. The monster keeps coming back to hurt the child.

Sometimes, the monster is a parent. The child is very scared that the parent will hurt them. The parent comes back to hurt the child. The parent may be in the next room, or the next house. The parent is trying to hurt the child.

Sometimes, the monster is a sibling. The child is very","The toddler woke up after hearing a shuffling noise and feeling their bed rattle. The bedroom was eerily dark and quiet all of a sudden. He turned on the light and saw a quick glimpse of what looked like hands retreating under the bed. ""DAD!"", he yelled out.

Dad bravely poked under the bed, squealed with excitement, and pulled out a toy fork from under the bed. Smiling, he showed the toddler his new toy - that he'd forgotten about. After a few cuddles and another bedtime story, he was fast asleep again.

"How did Andy Warhol create the ""piss paintings""?","

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In the 1960s, Andy Warhol (1928-1987) painted many large-scale works that he called ""Pictures"". ""Each one of them is a different picture, but it's all a picture to me,"" he said. The term ""piss painting"" was coined by art critic Kirk Varnedoe in his 1982 book Andy Warhol. In a 1980 interview, Warhol said, ""I don't know what to call it. I really don't. It's not a painting. It's just a picture.""

Pissing in a picture is a painting, but a ""piss painting"" is not necessarily a painting. The word ""piss"" is derived from the German word ""pissen"", which means ""to piss"" in the sense of pooping. In this sense, a ""piss painting"" is a painting that is created by splashing feces into a watery medium such as paint.

The term ""piss painting"" was coined by art critic Kirk Varnedoe in his 1982 book Andy Warhol. In a 1980 interview, Warhol said, ""I don't know what to call it. I really don't. It's not a painting. It's just a picture.""

Art critic Stephen Koch defines the term ""piss painting"" in a critique of Andy Warhol's film of a commercial art gallery in New York City. Koch uses the term to describe Warhol's film Surprise, which was shown at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City on November 27, 1966. Koch takes issue with the title of the film, which he describes as a joke.

In a 1980 interview,",Andy Warhol invited staffers who worked with him to help him paint by urinating on canvases that were covered by Warhol in copper paint.

Henry V. Porter wrote an essay titled ""March Madness"" in the Illinois Interscholastic in 1939 to commemorate the tournament. Other media outlets embraced the term as the tournament continued to sell out and thrive for decades. Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term ""March Madness"" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982.

What are rare-earth materials," a permanent magnetic?

A:

You are saying that you know that a permanent magnet is made up of rare-earth materials.

Rare earths are metals or alloys that have a very high magnetic
  susceptibility, a high degree of stability, and are non-ferromagnetic. 
  They are thus categorized as non-magnetic materials.

This is a definition not a fact.
Rare earths are metals or alloys that have a very high magnetic susceptibility, a high degree of stability, and are non-ferromagnetic. 
This is not a fact.
The definition as a metal or metal alloy is that there must be at least one heavy atom in the periodic table, generally a transition metal, that has a smaller radius than the other elements in the periodic table.  There are a few exceptions.
Commonly used heavy elements in the periodic table are:

Germanium (Si),
Beryllium (Be),
Manganese (Mn),
Iron (Fe),
Nickel (Ni), and
Cadmium (Cd).

Rare earths are not metals or alloys.  The only materials that you can make are the rare earths.  There is no reason to put any of these elements in a permanent magnet since they don't have a magnetic moment.
The magnetic moment is a result of the coupling of the electrons with their spin.  It is generated by the exchange interaction between the electrons in the material.  The coupling is the result of the electrons being in a particular spin state and the electrons in adjacent atoms having different spin states.
There are two reasons that you would want to have a high magnetic susceptibility.  One is to make the material easier to magnetize.  A high magnetic susceptibility material will yield a higher magnetic field at the surface.  This will make it easier to magnetize the material.  The second reason is to make the material more resistant to demagnetization.  A material that has a higher magnetic susceptibility will be able to retain the magnetic field after being demagnetized.
The high magnetic susceptibility of the rare earths are the result of the high magnetic moment that they have.  No metals or alloys have a high magnetic moment.  The high magnetic susceptibility is not the result of a high number of electrons.  The high magnetic susceptibility is the result of the large spin that the electrons have in the rare earths.
The high magnetic susceptibility of the rare earths is","Although originally thought to be rare, many of the minerals are actually common in the Earth's crust.

Why was Bacardi 151 discontinued in the US?,"azione

TikTok is a short video app that lets you create, share, and watch short videos in your phone. It was started in China by a group of teenagers, and has since grown to a global app with more than 300 million users.

In December, the company announced that it would be shutting down its adult-oriented TikTok, the video app that was banned in China, the United States, and parts of Europe.

The company said the decision to shut down TikTok was unrelated to its business in China, which accounts for less than 5% of its overall revenue.

""We are in the midst of a global transition and the best way to continue serving our users is with a wider, more diverse set of entertainment options,"" it said in a statement in December.

As part of the transition, Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming said the company would continue to operate under the TikTok brand, but would shift its focus to other areas.

The San Francisco-based company said in a statement it would ""transition TikTok's business to a new TikTok"" that would focus on ""creating a larger, more diverse set of entertainment options.""

The new TikTok, which will be released in the first half of 2019, will include mobile video games and a live-streaming platform, in addition to original adult content, according to a statement from the company.

""We believe TikTok's future is in providing entertainment options that our users want, and we will re-evaluate our business and products in light of this new direction,"" TikTok said.

The company's statement also said that it may make additional changes to its business in the future.

TikTok's video app banned in China was blocked in the United States in December and other countries in January.

The app was initially launched in 2014 by a group of Chinese teenagers, but it has since grown to more than 300 million monthly users.

Although it was initially launched in China, it has since expanded to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea.","Because of its high alcohol content, Bacardi 151 was particularly flammable among liquors.

Can AI ever replace human intelligence?

From a philosophical perspective, the idea of replacing human intelligence with AI has been around for a long time. ​The idea of AI being able to fully replace human intelligence was first proposed in the 1940s by John McCarthy. ​His idea was that if AI could learn to self-optimize, that is, to solve problems without being directly programmed to do so, it could be used to improve human intelligence. ​However, that vision has never come to fruition. ​The logical reason for this is because the human brain has a complete set of information processing mechanisms that cannot be replicated by any algorithm. ​We have seen many examples of AI systems performing tasks that the human brain is not equipped to perform, such as making decisions, but that computer systems have been able to do. ​Therefore, it is unlikely that AI will be able to fully replace human intelligence, but it will certainly make humans smarter. ​This is very much due to how humans are able to adapt to the world around them. ​Humans can learn and adapt to new situations, and this is something AI has not been able to consistently do.

"Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award 2019, was given to?","iro.

The award was created to honor the late comedian and actor Danny Kaye, who died in 2006 at age 76. The award was created by the Venice Film Festival, and is one of the most prestigious awards given by the festival.

Organized by the Venice Film Festival, the award was unveiled in 2015. The $100,000 award goes to an individual or company for a humanitarian project that demonstrates solidarity with the underprivileged and disadvantaged.

Crown Jewel

The award is named the Crown Jewel for its glittering and historic association with the Venice Film Festival. It is one of the most prestigious awards given by the festival and is considered the festival’s highest honor.

The award was created in 2015 by the International Federation of Film Producers Associations (FIPA), of which the Venice Film Festival is a member. The organization is a global trade association that includes filmmaking professionals from over 100 countries.

The award is given to a producer who, in the view of the award jury, has “shown an exceptional commitment to the promotion of socially responsible projects and initiatives.”

The award is sponsored by the FIPA and the Venice Film Festival. According to the FIPA, the award is not handed out every year, as the organization looks for an exceptional producer to receive the award.

The award is given in addition to the already-announced Golden Lion Award for Best Film and the Golden Lion Award for Best Director, both of which are given to the best film in the festival.

The Crown Jewel is accompanied by a rule package that includes the following elements:

A certificate of award and a gold medal

A letter of congratulations from the head of the festival

Two tickets to the Venice Film Festival

The award is given to a producer who will be present at the Cannes Film Festival in May. The producer must have a proven track record of social responsibility.

The award is given to producers of the most diverse range of films. Producers include those who have worked on projects of all kinds, including documentaries, animated films, and short films.

The award is not given to companies or organizations. However, the Venice Film Festival has partnered with two non-profit organizations, the Venice Film School and the Global Campus, to offer education programs, and the two organizations have also launched a number of social initiatives in the past.

From the passage identify the years in which major events happened in Icahn’s business career. Display the results in comma separated format.,"The name given to the group of investors that Icahn controlled. The partners in Icahn’s partnership with the Sands Corp. was the Carlyle Group.

Two weeks later, Icahn said he plans to take a $50-per-share stake in the casino.

Icahn: Icahn says he plans to buy a small stake in Sands, the casino operator, two weeks after saying he would.

In November, Icahn acquired a 7% stake in Sands for $550 million, raising his total stake to more than 4%. The casino is an important investor in the stocks of the Sands hedge fund, SandsCorp, and the global sports-betting company William Hill.

Icahn made the decision to buy a small stake in Sands after the casino declined to release information about its earnings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a letter to the agency, Sands said it was unable to provide it with the information because it was not in compliance with federal reporting requirements.

Icahn, who has also bought stock in Sands, threatened to sue the casino over the matter.

In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission fined Sands $1.5 million for not filing the information.

Sands: Sands Corp. said in a statement that the casino intends to continue to comply with the SEC’s reporting requirements.

Icahn: Icahn said in a statement Monday that the Sands Corp. has been a good partner for years.

Icahn: Icahn said he’s still interested in investing in Sands.

“I’m a businessman, and I’m not in this for the money,” Icahn said Monday. “But I do have a personal investment in the casino’s success.”

He said he has a long-term interest in the business.

“I also have a personal interest because I think the casino is a good operator and I think the casino is undervalued,” Icahn said.

Icahn, who said he has already lost $2 billion in bets on sports, said he would not be a “strategic investor” in Sands, because he doesn’t have the expertise to know whether the casino’s business model will work.

“I won’t be a strategic investor in the casino,” Icahn said. “I’m","1961, 1963,1968, 1978, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1988, 1987, 1991",0.707516,0.997404,14.482172,0.97994,0.767476,3.586902,-5.147915363311768

Which martial art or arts did Brazilian jiu-jitsu derive from?," ia martial art that was created by master Georg de Marchena in the 15th century, influenced by the art of luta de cavalo but with a more scientific focus. Wladimir K. Jelnkovich

Brazilian Suriapopular and martial artist Wladimir K. Jelnkovich explains what he means by the term ‘Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu’ and the different martial arts he studied.

What is Brazilian jiu-jitsu?

It’s a combination of Brazilian street fighting and judo techniques.

What martial art or arts did Brazilian jiu-jitsu derive from?

The original base of Brazilian jiu-jitsu is the art of luta de cavalo, which was created in the 6th century by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great. The art of luta de cavalo was created as a means of fighting against the Moors, but over time, it evolved into a more scientific art.

The art of luta de cavalo is quite similar to the art of judo, and is based on a series of postures and techniques that are performed with the feet, hips and legs. There are, however, subtle differences between the two arts, which are highlighted in Jelnkovich’s video below:

While the art of judo is primarily focused on the upper body, the art of luta de cavalo contains elements of grappling with the upper body and the lower body. In fact, the art of judo was used in Brazil during the first half of the 20th century, which is why Jelnkovich says that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a true mixture of two different martial arts.

What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a combination of Brazilian street fighting and judo techniques, which have been adapted by master Georg de Marchena, who was born in 1704 in the village of Araraquara, in the state of Sao Paulo.

In the 19th century, Georg de Marchena first studied judo, before moving on to Brazilian fighting techniques. He developed his own unique art, which he named luta de cavalo, which literally means ‘fighting with horse’.

According to Jelnkovich, the art of luta de cavalo was created as a means of fighting against the Moors, but over time, it evolved into",Brazilian jiu-jitsu was derived from judo and catch wrestling.,0.398019,0.999866,14.960618,0.995737,0.459731,3.562794,-4.701531410217285

How do you make Cincinnati style Venison Chili?,"venisonchili.com

I used a recipe I found on the ""Cincinnati Style Venison Chili"" website. It's a little bit different than the traditional recipe I have used, which is from ""The Ultimate Chili Cookbook.""

What is the difference between Cincinnati Style and Texas Style Chili?

The Cincinnati Chili recipe is a little bit different than the Texas Chili recipe I have used. Both are great, but I like the Cincinnati recipe better.

What are the best ingredients to use in a chili recipe?

I like to use venison as the meat in my chili. It's lean, so it cuts down on the fat in the chili. I like to use red kidney beans, because they are a little bit more flavorful than the black. I also like to use some of the dehydrated chipotles in adobo sauce. They are a great flavor enhancer. I also like to use some of the adobo sauce that I've made from the venison meat and the other parts of the venison. The rest of the ingredients that I use are the same as the ""The Ultimate Chili Cookbook.""

What is the best way to store chili?

Chili can be stored in the refrigerator for about 2-3 weeks. Chili will last longer if you freeze it. I usually freeze chili in the individual servings in freezer bags.

What are the best tools to use in the kitchen?

I like to use a cast iron skillet. It makes a great chili, and you can stick it in the oven or on a grill. I also like to use a pot with a lid and a 4 quart saucepan.

What are the best ways to cook a chili?

I like to grill the chili. You can also cook it in the oven. You can also use a pressure cooker to cook it, but I don't do that. You can also use a slow cooker. The longest it takes to cook it is 3 hours.

Is there a chili recipe you just love?

I like the Cincinnati Style Chili recipe from the ""Cincinnati Style Venison Chili"" website. It's a good recipe. And the recipe from the ""The Ultimate Chili Cookbook"" also has great taste.

If you don't know the theory, do you really know how to compose? Does it make sense to ask how much theory is needed for composing? I'd say that's a bit like asking how many units are needed. It's certainly not a trivial question.

It depends, but I think that if you don't know music theory, you don't know how to compose.

I don't think that's a particularly useful way to look at music theory, and I don't think that's what most people ask. One of the points of music theory is to help composers write better music.

How much theoretical knowledge do you actually need to write a piece of music?

In particular, how much knowledge of the rules of harmony and counterpoint you actually need to compose a piece of music?

For example, I'm a beginner,","Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

What is geodesy?

The word geodesy is a portmanteau of two Greek words:Géodésie (""geodetic"") and éphémérisme (""ephemeris""). It is a term that refers to the study of the paths of the heavenly bodies.

I understand that geodesy is the study of the paths of celestial objects. However, I'm not sure about the words ""geodesic"" and ""ephemeris"".

So, what is geodesy?

In particular, I am asking here about the mathematical meaning of geodesy. I don't know if the meaning of geodesy is the study of the paths of celestial objects (which is what I understand from the word geodesy) or if it is the study of the paths of stars (which is what I understand from the term ""star paths"").

I don't understand the difference between geodésie and éphémerisme. Could you please explain it in a simple way?

I would not recommend using the word geodesy as a term for the study of the paths of stars, since it is a portmanteau of two Greek words.

What is measured on the Gay-Lussac scale," to Estes, in an essay published in the Proceedings of the Boston Society for Medical Sciences, in 1828, is the ratio of the temperature of a gas when it is in the liquid state to its temperature when it is in the vapour state. The gaseous state is an unstable one, and the vapour is supposed to be the most stable. Estes showed that the vapour is actually a mixture of three components: one, which we may call a gas, is the one which is most stable; a second, or vapour, is the most unstable; the third, or liquid, is a combination of the other two. Estes calculated that the temperature of the liquid ought to be the same as the temperature of the vapour, and that the temperature of the gas should be that of the liquid or vapour. He then goes on to show that, according to the law of conservation of energy, the temperature of the gas should be equal to the temperature of the liquid. This result is confirmed by the laws of thermodynamics. According to these laws, the temperature of a gas is a maximum when it has the greatest specific volume of any substance; when it has the greatest specific volume, it is the most unstable; when it has the least specific volume, it is the most stable. The quantity of heat which a gas gives up when it is in the liquid state must be equal to the quantity of heat which a liquid gives up when it is in the gaseous state. When the gas is in the liquid state, it is in equilibrium with the liquid; when it is in the gaseous state, it is in equilibrium with the gas. In equilibrium, the quantities of the two substances are equal. When a gas is in equilibrium with a liquid, the temperature of the liquid is the same as the temperature of the gas. If the temperature of the liquid is known, it is easy to find the temperature of the gas. The theory of gases, therefore, does not depend upon the assumption that oxygen is the most stable element, but upon the assumption that oxygen is the most stable substance. We may add, however, that the law of conservation of energy is not the only law of chemical action which may be deduced from the laws of thermodynamics. In the second law of thermodynamics, the temperature of a substance is assumed to be an absolute constant. The second law of thermodynamics, therefore, does not require that the temperature of each substance be the same as the temperature of the other substances; it only requires that the temperatures of",Alcohol strength,0.105768,0.990406,5.317604,0.953953,0.130408,1.499628,-3.2997899055480957

What is the art of command,"'s art of command: how to command othersCommand, in general, is the art of making others obey you. In other words, it's the art of commanding others from the outside, rather than the inside.

For example, let's say you're the manager of a large factory that employs hundreds of people. You have a meeting scheduled with all the workers. You're scheduled to give a speech to them, and you're wondering how to command them to do their jobs.

What do you do?

First, you instruct them to bring their backup plans with them. Then you instruct them to walk around the room, and tell them what their backup plans are. Then, you go over your backup plans with them again.

You have a lot of backup plans, and you can't possibly know what they all are, so you keep giving them instructions.

By the end of the meeting, you have made the workers obey you.

This is the art of command.

What is the art of command?

Command is the art of making others obey you.

In other words, it's the art of commanding others from the outside, rather than the inside.

Suppose the manager's backup plans included punching the workers in the face.

The workers would be surprised that their boss was willing to do such a thing.

They would be even more surprised when the boss actually did it.

They would be even more surprised when the boss did it when they weren't looking.

The workers would be surprised that the boss had such a low opinion of them.

The workers would be even more surprised when they were fired.

They would be even more surprised when they were left with nothing but the clothes on their backs.

The workers would be surprised that their boss was able to deceive them so much.

Re: Why do people say St. Pat's for the Dolphins?

I think it's mainly because I think it's going to be a tall order for Miami to beat Miami. I don't know if I'm giving Miami enough credit. They're not a good team and should be more concerned with their next opponent.

I think it's because they're still a young team and may not be ready to play in the playoffs. I don't think they have the firepower of a team like Miami and the Dolphins may not be as close to being a good team as many people think.

The only thing I'd like to see is the Steelers being a better team than the Bengals in the playoffs.

Re: Why do people say St. Pat's for the Dolphins?

I think it's because I think it's going to be a tall order for Miami to beat Miami. I don't know if I'm giving Miami enough credit. They're not a good team and should be more concerned with their next opponent.

I think it's because they're still a young team and may not be ready to play in the playoffs. I don't think they have the firepower of a team like Miami and the Dolphins may not be as close to being a good team as many people think.

I don't agree. I will take the Steelers over the Dolphins any day.

Re: What was the thought of the Dolphins last year?

I don't think the Dolphins are a good team. They're just not. They don't have the talent to do it.

And I agree with you on the Dolphins public perception being that they are too young. Also, I don't think they have the firepower to beat the Steelers. The Steelers have the best QB in the NFL but that's about it.

Thank you!

The next time you read a review of a book, you need to first check if the book's cover or title is the same as its review. It's not a coincidence. A lot of people are looking for the review of the book just because it has a similar cover or title.

If there's a chance that you can get the book from the same author or publisher, go ahead and purchase the book.

Hey, I'm not telling you to go buy it! Just to be aware.

Here's the deal. This is a site dedicated to promoting authors and the books they write. I'm not saying that you should buy any of the books on this site, or even that you should read any of them.

The purpose of this site is to help you find the best books that are out there.

But you should at least try to read and review the books, especially the ones that are written by authors whose name you recognize. I think that's the only way you can do it.

So have fun. But don't forget to be kind to the authors and to the books in general.","Brendon Small is a  stand-up comedian, Creator of TV shows and Movies, and musician.",0.084709,0.938287,1.569233,0.9517,0.053597,0.719505,-4.619636058807373
How does the train work?,". The train, or more correctly a train car, is a rather unique and interesting design. Occasionally, the train can be seen moving, but more often than not, the train is stationary and the only activity is the loading and unloading of passengers. The train moves by different means, depending on the train. The most obvious is the use of a steam locomotive. The train is a very large box where passengers can hide from the heat of the steam locomotive. The train also has a large crane to lift passengers and cargo. The train can also be seen at a train station where passengers can board and disembark the train. The train also has the ability to carry cargo on the train. The train cars are arranged in a line to make the most efficient use of space. The train is called a train car because the large box resembles a train car. The front of the train car is open and allows access for the locomotive to drive underneath the car. The locomotive drives the train using a large steam engine. The locomotive engine is called the tender. The locomotive is able to drive the train through a large set of gears. Sometimes, the train will use a large generator to power the locomotive. The locomotive gives off a very large amount of steam to drive the train. The train is able to move at a very slow speed. The train can travel at different speeds depending on the terrain. The train can go as slow as one mile per hour and as fast as 60 miles per hour. The train is most often used for passenger transportation. Train travel is very popular in Europe. The train is very convenient for traveling and can be used for both freight and passenger travel. The train is extremely efficient. The train is able to move a very large amount of freight in a very small amount of time. The train is very easy to use and requires very little maintenance.

Electric locomotives use electricity from overhead wires to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, making them lighter, faster, and quieter than steam or diesel engines.


How Does a Diesel Locomotive Work:
Diesel-electric locomotives provide cheaper upfront costs and improved reliability.

Train wheels are conical, allowing them to travel a longer distance while turning at the same speed as the inner wheel. The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the ""flange"" of the wheel limiting lateral movement.

How to become good friends with your neighbor?,"ionProducer: Joel McMillan. The idea behind this series is to provide a platform for teachers to explore the power of friendly, respectful relationships in our schools.

Are you a teacher? Have you ever had a student who was kind to you and you felt kind about them? How does that make you feel? Do you want more of that in your classroom? I think of a story I read recently.

“I’ve had kids who would ask me if I could help them in their math class. I would say, ‘I can’t help you. I don’t know how to do that.’ And they would say, ‘But I don’t know how to do that! I’m doing my best. Why can’t you help me?’ I don’t know. So I’ve just been kind to them, because I feel like it’s just the right thing to do to be kind to them. And even if I’m not able to help them, I still feel like I have to be kind to them.

“I’ve had kids ask, ‘Would you tell me the secret to your success?’ And I say, ‘What secret?’ Because I don’t know. And they say, ‘I don’t know how you do it!’ I’m like, ‘I don’t know! But I want to be your friend!’

“I think about the kids who are kind to me. I tell my students, ‘You know, I don’t know how to be your friend. But I know I want to be your friend. I don’t ever want to be your enemy. I’ll always want to be your friend. I just don’t know how to be your friend!’”

I think of all the adults in my life who have been kind to me. I don’t know how to be their friend. But I know I want to be their friend. I don’t ever want to be their enemy. I’ll always want to be their friend.

When I think about how to become good friends with your neighbor, I think of what the writer of Ecclesiastes says. “Good friendship with [a neighbor] is kept safe and sound only with the help of the Lord’s hand.” I think of the story of Jacob and the Angel of the Lord. The angel said, “I, too, will be with you; your God will be","Regardless you live in a house or an apartment, it is important to build a friendly relationship with your neighbor.

When was Genghis Khan born?,"ed

The death of Genghis Khan in 1227 is estimated to have occurred between 1228 and 1229. It is believed that he died from the effects of polio, particularly in his left arm and leg.

It is said that when he was 10 years old Genghis Khan's leg was smashed by a tree. When his leg was amputated he was left with a wooden stump. The stump was removed to prevent the spread of smallpox, which was then endemic in Mongolia.

A few years later he contracted the disease from a woman infected with leprosy and died. It was thought that the disease had been passed through his blood, but this was not confirmed.

At the age of 11 Genghis Khan was given the nickname ""The Lion of Khotan"" by his uncle, who was present when he was born, because of his extraordinary size.

He later adopted the name ""Mongol"" because of his Mongol ancestry.

When Genghis Khan was 8 years old he fought off a group of nomads in a wrestling match. He then left home and travelled to the Chinese city of Kaifeng, where he was adopted by the local ruler.

He was then sent to the city of Hinggan, and in 1221 he killed the governor of Kabul, Abaqa. In 1223 he defeated the Chinese general Li Yong and took Hinggan. He then moved on to Peking, where he captured Emperor Renzong and enslaved him. The emperor was later executed in 1224 by Genghis Khan's grandson, Subutai.

Genghis Khan then invaded China to capture the emperor's son, but he was defeated by Emperor Huizong. In 1226 Genghis Khan was killed by the Mongol general Ogedei.

When Genghis Khan was 12 or 13 years old, his uncle Börte took him out to fight with a sword and shield. In this battle, Börte was killed by a spear, and Genghis Khan then took over the leadership of the Mongol army.

Countless Mongol tribes submitted to Genghis Khan in 1220. Between 1219 and 1221 Mongol warriors attacked the Chinese capital of Kaifeng, then they took over the Chinese capital of Hinggan, which they renamed ""Tianjing"" (literally ""Great Capital"").

Should I buy a gravel bike or a down country mountain bike?,"

I have been on the road for 4 years now and I have a gravel bike. I think I have the gear for it. I like dirt more than pavement. I ride the pavement when it's flat. If I get in the dirt I stay there. I don't ride the pavement when it's flat. I ride the gravel when I feel like it. I've only bought 1 new bike in all those years and that was a Giant. I bought it because I wanted to be able to eat and have some place to work. I just rode it for a year and a half. Then I bought a used bike and started riding it. I don't have a problem with it. It was just a matter of time, as my bike is older and I don't have the right stuff. But I think I have the right stuff now. I'm pretty flexible in what I ride. I really want to ride a bike that is stable and fun to ride. I don't ride a bike for the fun factor. I ride a bike to get where I want to go. I ride a bike to work and love riding it on the pavement. I ride a bike when I just want to ride a bike for the fun of it. I ride a bike when I'm tired or when I want to get somewhere fast. I ride a bike to keep my legs and lungs in shape. I ride a bike to make money. I ride a bike because I need a bike. So, I guess I should buy a gravel bike or a mountain bike. I really don't have a problem with either. I like the idea of having a bike that can handle some dirt. Not a bike that's made for pavement. I ride my bike on the street and I ride my bike on the trails. I don't really have any preferences. I just want something that will be able to get me where I want to go. I want to get to the next trail or the next mountain and get to work. I want to see if I can ride a bike around the trails. I don't have any big plans for this year. I'll probably ride more riding a bike than I have in a year. I've been riding my bike for a long time now. I'm just getting a little tired of it. I like riding it and not having to take it to the shop. I like riding it when it's cold. I like riding it when I have a little more snow on the trails. I do miss riding a bike","Although there is reasonable overlap in what you can use gravel and downcountry bikes for, the answer her largely depends on what you plan to do the most of and if trail riding will be important for you. Gravel bikes are great for covering offroad miles more efficiently and long days in the saddle both on road or offroad. However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!). However, downcountry bikes are usually heavier but the full suspension and geometry makes them less efficient compared to a gravel bike.",0.146576,0.999286,36.764146,0.990118,0.217496,7.823524,-2.936248779296875

Would my landlord allow me to have my dog living at the house?,", I have a pitbull. I have 2 other dogs and it would be easy to house train them.

I'm not sure if you could have your dog at your home, but having them live in a doggie hotel could be possible in some areas. I know of a couple of places that will allow you to have your dog stay with you if you're willing to pay an extra fee. I don't know how much it would cost, but I know of these places that allow you to have your dog stay in your room. I know one guy that just brought a pitbull to a hotel and stayed there.

My brother and his wife live in California, and they own an RV. They have a 2-year-old son, and he has a dog. He said that they take their dog with them when they travel, so that he can go to the doggie hotel.

It's possible that you could take your dog to a hotel, but you would need to look into it because your landlord might not allow you to have your dog.

I'd like to hear more about your landlord and if you have a roommate, if that is the case, you might want to let them know about the dog.

My landlord has had a few dogs in the past, and I don't think he would want my pitbull.

The newest CLC is the SQ7, a 7-bladed fan blade with a strong, nearly hair-trigger blade-activation system. A different kind of blade-activation system, it provides a more secure, more responsive, more responsive blade control system that provides greater maneuverability and safety.

The SQ7 is an all-new fan blade design by Yamaha, based on a unique combination of advances in technology and materials. The SQ7 blade is a high-performance fan blade with a unique semi-active blade control system that minimizes loss of control during take-off and landing. The blade is 7 times stronger than the previous generation, and is now made of super-high-strength alloy.

The SQ7 is equipped with the new SQ7-S/R airbox, a new design that provides improved effectiveness and efficiency. The specially designed airbox features a powerful “S” shape to provide a larger air passage and reduce turbulence, thus improving the airflow rate and reducing unsteadiness.

The SQ7-S/R airbox is equipped with an automatic blade-control function (SQ7-S/R-Auto), which automatically activates the blade at take-off and landing. This makes it possible to perform rotor take-off and landing smoothly, even with a weak or heavy blade.

A new blade-control system that minimizes loss of control during take-off and landing has been added to the SQ7-S. This system is a combination of the SQ7 with the SQ7-S/R airbox and SQ7-S/R-Auto.

The SQ7-S/R-Auto blade-control system automatically activates the blade at take-off and landing, thus minimizing loss of control during take-off and landing.

What are the reasons why quantum theory is considered do difficult to understand,", even though we have a good quantum theory for the macroscopic world? Why are we so reluctant to accept the quantum theory for the microscopic world? Because quantum theory is so difficult to understand, even though it has been around for over a century, it is not widely accepted.

The reason why quantum theory is so difficult to understand is that it is not a theory of the world, but a theory of the systems that can be in the quantum world. The quantum world is a world of systems that we can never observe. So, it is very difficult to understand the concept of the quantum world, especially the concept of the wave function.

What is the meaning of the wave function? The wave function is the way in which the system can be in different states, and we can never observe the system to be in a specific state. Because this is a wave function, it is not possible for us to measure it. The wave function is a probabilistic wave function, and the probability is equal to the square of the amplitude. Because the amplitude is not known, the probability is not known, so we will never see the system to be in a specific state.

What is the meaning of the wave function? A system that is in a superposition of two or more states is said to be in a quantum state. The probability is then equal to the square of the amplitude, and so the probability can be zero, or equal to one. So, a system that is in a superposition of two or more states is said to be in a quantum state.

So, if you take a system that is in a superposition of two states, it is in a quantum state. If you take a system that is in a superposition of two states, that system is in a quantum state. There is another way to think of it - the wave function is the distribution of the system in the possible states. A system can be in one state, or it can be in two states, or it can be in any number of states.

So, the wave function is the way in which the system can be in different states. The wave function is the way in which the system can be in different states, and we cannot measure the state of the system. So, the wave function is a way in which the system can be in different states, and we cannot see it in our experiment.

What is the meaning of the wave function? The wave function can be represented as a sum of various complex numbers, such as the","1. There is not one agreed set of basic rules (axioms) that underpin the theory and each has subtle implications on how you interpret the theory
2. For each of those there are multiple views and mathematical frameworks for describing the theory (e.g. the wave mechanics, field theories, etc)
3. The mathematical theories are all at an advanced level and few examples of how to actually apply them appear in text books.
4. The theory itself says that you cannot know the intermediate steps in any quantum process, you can know where you start and predict where you might end up but not how you get form one to the other.
5. The theory is based on either infinitely parallel actions occurring deterministically or statistical interpretation of a range of outcomes
6. All of these interactions occur without direct reference to space/time and so are in abstract spaces that need to be decided for the calculation and physically interpreted",0.093089,0.981397,23.420559,0.987594,0.098005,5.116129,-3.537487506866455

Notice: This is the roadmap entry for the Book of Vile Curses. If you'd like to read the content of the entry please go to the main list.

Book of Vile Curses

by

C.S.E. Cocteau

The Curse of the Vampires

Violet Constance Jessop is a student of history at the University of Oxford. She is a devoted student of Egyptology, and the curator of the Egyptian exhibit at the British Museum. She is not alone in her devotion. Her lover is an equally devout student of Egyptian history, and an equally dedicated professor of Egyptology. Together, they are a couple of superstudents who are more interested in the past than in the present.

However, the past is not what it seems to be. The curse of the vampires has been reviving since the beginning of time, and is growing stronger. Across the world, witches, warlocks, and other supernatural creatures are being destroyed by the Curse.

The Curse of the Vampires is the first book in a trilogy about the supernatural world. The second book, The Curse of the Hellhounds, will be released in September 2009.

The Weather in Arizona and California

Arizona and California have similar weather patterns, but there are noticeable differences in the weather.

The Weather in Arizona

Arizona is a great place to live because it gets a lot of sun most of the year. Arizona is in the United States of America","Reasons to Live in Arizona
 

There are so many reasons to love Arizona, but is it a good place to live? We think so. Here are our top reasons to live in the beautiful state of Arizona. 

 

1. Great Places to Live
 

One popular benefit of living in Arizona is the relatively low cost of living.

 

Families are moving to Arizona for affordable housing and a better quality of life. Here are some of our favorite cities.

 

Phoenix
 

Nicknamed the ""Valley of the Sun,"" Phoenix is a bustling city with a great combination of a thriving job market, affordable living, and many ways to enjoy the outdoors.

 

Phoenix has it all. From professional sports to amazing eateries to great shopping districts, there's so much to do in Phoenix. 

 

It's a popular spot for young professionals, families, and retirees too. It's home to Arizona State University, dozens of museums, and endless outdoor adventures. And people are flocking to Phoenix, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the country.

 

Litchfield Park
 

This beautiful city is located",0.460257,0.999163,26.678826,0.997538,0.530392,5.933235,-3.965801954269409
"Categorize the companies based on their ownership status.
Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Deloitte, KPMG, Ernst & Young",":
The first three have no ownership stake in the company and are just investors.
Deloitte & Touche, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG:
These companies have some ownership stake in the company.
Ernst & Young, Deloitte & Touche, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG:
These companies have an ownership stake greater than 10%.

The next two are not listed in the list above:

Oppenheimer & Co., Morgan Stanley:
These companies have an ownership stake greater than 50%.

A:

The answer is ""yes"" but it is a bit ""unusual""
Let's consider the three most common types of ownership:

Founder, CEO, CTO, CFO, etc
Sole Proprietorship/Partnership/Company
Employees

If you look at a company like Google (and many others), you will see that the founder is a partner in the company and gets a significant portion of the profits.
This is not the case for the first three types of ownership. You can't make such claims for your own company.
With this in mind, let's assume that you have a business and you have three types of ownership.
In the first case you have a 100% ownership and you are the only one who can make the decisions.
If you have a sole proprietorship/partnership/company you are the only one who can make the decisions.
If you have an employee you are the only one who can make the decisions.
There are those who will argue that the first type of business is the only one that can make a profit. I disagree.

A:

The answer is no.
There are companies that have a person as a majority owner.  One example is Amazon, where Jeff Bezos is the majority owner.  In the US, that is a ""wholly-owned subsidiary"".

How do you explain cloud computing to a 5 year old?,"ation: it's just a fancy word for having an extra hard drive. Cloud computing is a way for companies to run their servers on computers that are cheaper than their own, and much easier to manage. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) service allows you to lease computing power for a fee, and if you're a small company, you can probably get away with using just a few servers. But if you have a million people doing the same thing, and you want to keep costs down, you can't just put your servers on the cloud. You have to figure out how to run them yourself.",Imagine you are building some thing using lego pieces. All of your legos are in basket.  As you start to build your desired structure you start to take 1-3 or couple of handful of legos from the basket. As you start to give some shape to the structure you are designing you start to put back some of the legos into the basket you don't need. Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket).

What are some signs and symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes?,"asal, facial, and trunk swelling due to high blood sugar level.

Can you have high blood sugar without diabetes? The answer to this question depends on how you define high blood sugar. High blood sugar is a condition in which the amount of glucose in the blood is higher than normal. If your blood sugar is high, you may not be diabetic, but you could still have high blood sugar and not know it.

What are some signs and symptoms of high blood sugar? If you have high blood sugar, you may have symptoms like:

Crying, anger, or irritability

Frequent urination

Appetite changes

Fatigue

Decreased athletic performance

Chills

Weakness

Diagnosis of high blood sugar is not an easy task. It can be difficult to tell if you have high blood sugar without a diabetes test. High blood sugar levels can fluctuate, so it's difficult to know when it's safe to stop taking medication or when to see a doctor.

The only way for you to know for sure if you have high blood sugar is to get a blood sugar test.

Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include loss of taste. Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.

In total how long was Winston Churchill the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.," , to be sure, that the cabinet had its own views on the subject, but their opposition was not sufficient to prevent Churchill's appointment. He was certainly the most able man in the field. The government was in a state of confusion. The war had been going badly for some time. It was then under the control of an incompetent and corrupt ministry. The Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, had been forced to resign after only three months. There was a general election to be held in a matter of months. This was the first national election since 1931. However, Churchill's appointment was regarded by many as a gesture of desperation. The government had lost all its credibility. The Labour Party had already formed the official opposition to the government. A Labour government might have had the opportunity to bring about some reforms. But it had been unable to do so. The party had always been in opposition. It was therefore an obvious choice. It was also a tactical choice. At the time it was thought that Churchill might be able to win the election. This may have been a mistake. The American president, Franklin Roosevelt, had been a great friend of Churchill. He had sent a personal message to the Prime Minister. He had also sent a message to the King. But the Conservative Party was strong in the country. The election campaign was conducted largely on the basis of personalities. Churchill's speeches were full of energy and originality. But he was not able to persuade the electorate that he had the strength to carry on the war. The result was a crushing defeat for the Conservatives. The Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, was not re-elected. He was replaced by a member of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee. The third round of the election was held in the autumn of 1945. Churchill went into it with great hopes of victory. It was thought that his leadership would be vindicated and that the war would be won. But in the end he came third. He was not able to secure an overall majority. Instead he was able to form a coalition with the Labour Party. The result was a coalition government. This was thought to be a good thing. The Labour Party had been in opposition since 1931. It had lost the election in 1945. It had also lost the 1945 general election. It was thought that the new government would do the nation a great service. But a coalition government was also thought to be a bad thing. It was thought that the Conservative Party would win the next election. If it did, the Conservatives would have a majority",A total of 9 years in 2 spells between 1940 to 1945 and 1951 to 1955.,0.603573,0.997518,18.191152,0.994277,0.608441,4.278992,-3.116912841796875

Who owns Ritz Crackers?,"ation.com, and our friends at Cracked Magazine and the New York Times.

Stewart, a former Florida attorney general, says he has no plans to run.

""I wouldn't run,"" he says in a phone interview. ""It's an opportunity to get the message out to people that there are some good, competent lawyers out there. And you're not going to get this job unless you have a good personality.""

Stewart says he's spent 10 years traveling the country in his own law firm, Stewart & Associates, while also serving as a commissioner of the state ethics commission. He says he has been involved in more than 80 cases, including a wrongful-death lawsuit against a Florida dentist who left a patient with a brain infection that was caused by a rat.

Although he says the Ritz cracker situation isn't as complicated as the Jell-O case, he says he's had to make some tough calls about the case.

""I was the arbiter of the facts,"" he says. ""And you have to make some tough calls. I suspended the Ritz cracker case.""

Can you list down some points about Jo-Anne Polak from the given text?,"

Being a young adult, I have a tendency to make many of my own decisions, and this is one of them. I have come to the conclusion that my boyfriend is not the guy for me. He's a decent guy, but he's not the right guy for me. I don't know why I have had such a difficult time in finding a man who will love me for me, and not in terms of what my looks are. I've never been a supermodel, and I don't think that's what he thinks I am. I'm not really sure what he thinks I am, but I know he has never loved me. I've never been in love with him, but I do love him. I don't think he loves me, though. He doesn't even like me sometimes. I have never had a problem with people that don't like me, but I don't know why. I don't know why I have been so hard on myself. I am so disappointed in myself. I came out of the closet a few months ago. I was scared, because I knew I was a lesbian. I had a lot of issues with my past and with people I had been with. I was afraid of what people would think of me, and what they would say to me. But even though I was scared, I knew that I was going to have to live my life without apology. I made up my mind to do that. I don't want to be ashamed of myself, or to have people make fun of me. I wanted to be honest with myself to make sure I was on the right path. I made the decision to be myself and not to hide from people. I have never hidden who I am. I have never been ashamed of myself. I am who I am. I am a lesbian. I want to be honest with myself, and I think that is a very important thing. I think it is very important to be honest with yourself, and with others. I want people to see me as a person, and not as someone who is a lesbian. I think it is very important to be honest with yourself. I am not ashamed of myself. That's why I am an open book. I have always been honest with people. I have always been open about things. I think it is very important to be open about your feelings, and to be honest about yourself. I would like to meet a man that I could be honest with. I think that's very important. I","1. From 1989 to 1991, Jo-Anne Polak served as the general manager of the Ottawa Rough Riders.

What is the 149th Boat Race?,"

The 149th Boat Race is scheduled to take place on Sunday 3rd July 2021. It's billed as ""the world's biggest sporting event on the water"" and ""the race to decide who will be the fastest man on the planet"". The race is the fourth leg of the Thames to Dartford Challenge series.

The race is organised by the Royal Thames Yacht Club, and the Royal London Yacht Club, and is the oldest of the three legs. The event is also known as the Regatta.

This is a national one-day event, so that means no local teams are allowed to enter, and teams must currently be registered with the governing body of their respective sport.

The race starts and finishes at Greenwich on the southern bank of the River Thames. It is held every year during the Thames season, which is basically the summer months when the river is not too busy with other activities. It is the last leg of the series, and is the last event of the season, when teams compete in the regatta to determine who is the best boat racer and who is the fastest.

The race is considered to be the world's biggest sporting event on the water, and is one of the most prestigious on the calendar. A team is only allowed to compete in the race in one of two boat classes:

Class A is a small boat that traditionally weighs between 3-10 tonnes, and uses a single outboard motor for propulsion. It is the most popular boat class, and the boats compete in the race to determine who is the fastest man on the planet.

Class B is a large boat that has a maximum weight of 12 tonnes, and uses twin outboards for propulsion. The class is considered to be the fastest, and is the least popular boat class.

The ratings system is used to determine the winner of the race. A rating system similar to the FIA Formula One World Championship is used to determine the winner of the race. The rating system is as follows:

The higher the rating, the faster the boat. The ratings are the same for both boats in the same boat class.

The rating system is based on the following criteria:

Overall speed

Total boat speed

Maximum speed

Top speed

Downwind speed

Wind-aided top speed

The maximum speed for each boat is the highest speed achieved in the race. The total boat speed is the overall top speed achieved in","The 149th Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race along a 4.2 mile tidal stretch of the River Thames in south-west London that took place on April 6th, 2003 between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge.",0.23433,0.995005,19.498553,0.86422,0.279735,4.374369,-5.1827545166015625
Give me a list of popular Netflix shows I can watch now.,". I gotcha.

I’d also like to see a few more comedies. I’m pretty sure there’s a lot of comedies out there that I wouldn’t be surprised to find out I’ve never seen, and I’d like to rectify that. Plus, some of them are really funny, and I can’t tell you how I’ll feel if I never see any of these other shows.

What would you like to see on Netflix?

I’m not even going to pretend I know what kind of shows we’re going to get next year, but I’d just like to see the same good stuff that’s out there. I don’t want to see a bunch of crap, no matter what network it’s coming from.

Do you have a favorite show that you’ve never seen yet?

I’ve never seen The League, but I have heard great things about it. I’m not sure I’m going to see it, but I’m excited to hear about the movie.

I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a show that doesn’t have a DVD, and I’d love to see one that does. I think a lot of people don’t realize how many TV shows are on DVD, but it’s crazy. They’ve got a lot of great stuff out there.

Do you have a favorite movie from the ’90s?

I don’t know if I’d call it a favorite, because it’s been a while, but I loved Clueless. I always have. I love the fact that I’m a glass half full person, but I’m also a glass half empty kind of person. I love movies that are good, but I also like the ones that are bad. It’s hard for me to pick.

I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a show that I haven’t seen in the theater. I love watching movies in theaters, and I love watching shows in theaters. It just wouldn’t be my first choice, but it’s not something I think is a complete deal-breaker.

","Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.989657,0.919931,1.095681,0.987381,0.99288,0.997106,

"How do I get to Juneau, Alaska?",". I will have to take the Alaska Marine Highway ferry to Juneau, and then rent a car to drive to the cannery.

I am planning to get to Juneau on June 7, so I will miss the first day of the festival, but that's okay.

If I am still in Juneau when the festival starts, I should be able to leave from Juneau on Friday, June 31, so I'll be able to stay in Juneau on Friday, July 1. If I go to Juneau on the morning of June 7, I will need to leave on the morning of July 1.

If I can't make it to Juneau, I could drive up to the cannery on the ferry, but I will need to drive all the way back to Juneau on Friday. Is there a better way of getting to the cannery from Juneau?

(I have also been told that there is a shuttle bus that goes to Lyle. I assume this is what you mean. I may have to take it.)

I will be leaving from Juneau on Friday, June 31, and arriving back in Juneau on Friday, July 1.

This is where I plan to leave from Juneau on Friday, June 31, and arrive in Juneau on Friday, July 1.

I plan to leave from Juneau on Friday, July 31 to travel to the cannery in Skagway, Alaska, and return to Juneau on Friday, August 2.

If I am in Juneau on Friday, July 31, I will take the ferry to Skagway.

If I am in Juneau on Friday, August 2, I will drive to the cannery.

If I am in Juneau on Friday, August 2, I will need to leave on Friday, August 15.

Give me a list of important things to take on an international trip,".

A couple of years ago, I went on a week-long trip through Europe with a group of friends. It was a blast and I think it's a great idea to take the time to do something like that for yourself, but I can't help but think that I'd end up with a different skill set if I did it. I've been doing this type of travel for a few years now and have traveled to nearly a dozen countries over the course of my life, so I've got some knowledge. I just don't think I'd be nearly as comfortable with my own country.

I'm interested in learning more about the culture, but in order to get any real information I'd have to go somewhere where I wasn't familiar with the language. I also have to try to read the signs and understand what they're telling me. Honestly, I think I'd be a lot more relaxed if I tried to just learn the language in a country that already has the language down.

I know I'm not the only one that would be interested in learning more about the culture. I'd like to learn more about the history, and the religions that are practiced.","Here's a list of most important things you need on an international trip :

1. Passport and visa : All documents required to get into the destination and get back. Make sure all the documents are valid and are not going to expire within 6 months of your trip.
2. Money : Ensure that you have the appropriate amount of money you need. Check if the debit/credit cards are going to work seamlessly in your destination country. In some places, it is helpful to carry local currency while others might prefer transactions through mobile apps (Wepay, GPay, etc).
3. Medications : Ensure that you have enough supply of any prescribed medications. Even the generic medicines might be hard to find in some places.
4. Clothing : Pack the right kind of clothes, layers, and footwear depending on the destination weather and planned activities.
5. Internet and Phone connection : Plan to have international roaming enabled on your devices or buy local prepaid phone plans. When using your existing phone plan, validate that it supports the network in your destination country. In some countries, the free wifi access requires a local phone number.

I have been in the States for over 5 years. I am a citizen in good standing and have completed and passed all my immigration test. I would like to know how to prepare for the naturalization interview and what kind of questions I should expect.

HI
I am a citizen born in the usa and spent several years living in the uk and am currently living in the uk. I have completed my naturalization test and I am a citizen now. I wish to be naturalized in the US but I have one question which is that if i am applying for a job, i have to have my US green card for at least 5 years, so i thought that i should have 2 green cards. So i am confused on whether i should have 2 green cards or one green card with my current one. if i have 2 green cards, do i have to apply for a green card for the first time again? Please help.

My husband and I were married in the United States in 1994 and have been living here legally since that time. We have one child who was born in the United States in 1997. The child is a U.S. citizen, but we have never applied for a child's passport. We will be moving to Germany in the next two years. We do not know if we will apply for a passport when we move. We will be joining my mother who is in Germany. She is a Canadian citizen and has no problem with this. If we apply for a passport, how will the German government know about it?

What are the causes Alzheimer's disease?,"seal of blood vessels in the brain, damage to the nerve cells, brain shrinkage, and the build-up of plaque in the brain's blood vessels.Alzheimer's disease a form of dementia, often accompanied by other disorders.Alzheimers disease affects a person's ability to think and learn. Alzheimers disease can affect one's ability to talk and understand. Alzheimers disease can affect one's ability to move around, and to eat and drink.Alzheimer's disease is a disease in which the nerve cells of the brain, which send signals to and from the body control, can't work normally. And this can affect one's ability to control one's thoughts, moods and behavior.Alzheimer's disease occurs slowly, the first symptoms are usually memory loss, and thinking is slow. Alzheimers disease usually develops slowly over several years. People with Alzheimer's disease usually develop dementia, but not all dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimers disease is a type of dementia.Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease.The Alzheimer's Association is a nonprofit community of more than 4 million caring people. Alzheimers disease is the most common form of dementia, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.Source: http://alzheimers.org/

Alzheimer's disease being more common than we think. Anybody who has had a loved one, family member, friend, or neighbor with Alzheimer's disease will tell you how hard it is to watch them decline and die. And it is not like a death sentence. Alzheimer's disease is a condition that lives on as a family member, friend, and caregiver until the day they die. The disease is progressive, and the severity and progression depends on the individual.

Many people in the US are living with Alzheimer's disease, but it is not as common as we think. In fact, the Alzheimer's Association estimates that 5.2 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. That means that one in three people over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. And that number is rising.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disease, where it will get worse. The more you have, the worse it gets. Only about 5% of people with Alzheimer's disease have the full-blown form of the disease. The other 95% have some form of Alzheimer's disease.

There are two main causes of Alzheimer's disease, genetic and environmental. Genetic causes","Undrestanding the causes of the Alzheimer's disease is an ongoing research. The research so far indicate that causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors may differ from person to person. 
One well-known gene that influences Alzheimer’s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which has been identified via Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream.",0.490934,0.996753,20.10615,0.976573,0.524199,4.618922,-3.639113426208496

","John Dassow, Jr. (August 10, 1845 – October 8, 1917) was an American farmer, manufacturer, and politician.

Born in what is now Mecklenburg, Germany, Dassow emigrated with his parents, in 1861 to the United States and settled on a farm in the town of Sheboygan Falls, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. In 1864 and 1865, Dassow served in the 30th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Dassow was a farmer and owned the Sheboygan County Mills. He was also involved with cheese factories and the real estate business. Dassow served on the Sheboygan County Board of Supervisors and was chairman of the county board. He was also treasurer of the local school board. In 1893, Dassow served in the Wisconsin State Assembly and was a Democrat. In 1917, Dassow died at his house in the town of Sheboygan Falls from ill health.",0.294963,0.816692,2.957861,0.842324,0.315988,1.045566,-10.46218490600586
Give me a list of funny American sitcoms that had their first season in the 2000s,"-style. New sitcoms started every few years. The most recent, Parks and Recreation, was the most recent to have been launched between the late 2000s and 2010s.

The list is not as long as one would expect. Some sitcoms were launched in the early 2000s and later returned to the air. Others were first produced in the mid-2000s and later went off the air.

The 2000s were also a time of change in the way TV is produced. The first wave of sitcoms was produced on videotape, and many of them, like Seinfeld and Married With Children, are now available on DVD. Also, while the TV network executives still sometimes insisted on having shows produced in front of a live audience, by the 2000s, most TV shows were produced in front of a studio audience and aired later in the evening.

The 2000s is also the decade of the first “big” sitcom. The plots of the shows are usually light and humorous, and they often revolve around a single character. The characters, too, are often very simple. In the 2000s, the sitcoms had a lot of characters, but very few of them were very complex.

The 2000s was also a time of transition in the genre of the comedy sketch show. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of sketch comedy, a form of comedy that mixed sketch comedy with stand up comedy. In the 2000s, the sketch comedy continued to grow, but the sketch comedy is now a more specialized form of comedy.

The 2000s was also a time of transition in the genre of the comedy talk show. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of talk shows, a form of talk show that mixed the interview with the comedy. In the 2000s, talk show – especially the variety talk show – was a more specialized form of comedy.

It is also a time of transition in the genre of the comedy variety show. The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of variety shows, a form of comedy that mixed talk show with variety format. In the 2000s, variety show – especially the game show variety show – is a more specialized form of comedy.

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more.”

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.

The idea behind Scala is that it is an object-oriented language, but this doesn't mean that everything in Scala is object-oriented.
From the Scala documentation:

Scala is an object-oriented language, but it's not a full-fledged object-oriented language. That's because Scala is designed to run on the JVM and Java's standard API. In Scala, methods and variables are first-class values, and classes are mostly syntactic sugar for object definitions.

In particular, the build system is not an object-oriented language.

Which part of the world do you find the most people bicycling?,"ment of the foot or ankle?  What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of bicycling?  How can bicycling help you to become a better person?

(from http://www.bike2passport.com/bike2passport.html)","Bicycling is a form of human powered movement that typically involves sitting or standing on a machine with two wheels that can be propelled forward by using one's arms or legs.  The bicycle was invented in the early 1800 (1817) by a German inventor named Drais.  The early bicycles were built from wood and soon after used heavy steel for the frame and wheels.  These steel bikes were called Boneshakers because when you road on them you would feel every stone and bump through your bones.  Bicycling exists in nearly every corner of the world, on every continent and it is done by all people.  In many countries, bicycling is the primary mode of transportation for people, especially in urban settings.  Bicycling is also a professional sporting competition where men and women race against one another in large groups in front of cheering crowds.  Bicycling is a very efficient form of converting power generated by a human into forward motion.  While most humans",0.01295,0.467873,2.625305,0.704126,0.014806,0.765012,-5.308344841003418
What kind of u-boat was the SM U-30," that you were the first to sink?

Yes, the SM U-30 was the first one I sank. It was a North German U-boat which I sank on August 17th, 1936.

What was your first sighting of an enemy submarine?

I was serving on a mine-sweeping patrol in the North Sea. I had picked up a contact on the surface which was a submarine. I went up to investigate but could not see her clearly. I decided to surface and enter her to search her for mines. I got close enough to do that, however, the U-boat had a covering fire of machine guns and I could not get the U-boat under way with only one of the two engines on. I was sure that she was a German U-boat and could not get away. I ordered the destroyer to open fire on the U-boat. When she opened fire she must have seen the close range and the accuracy of the fire. She dived. I saw her dive but could not get closer. I then ordered the destroyer to ram the U-boat. I saw the U-boat dive and the destroyer ram the U-boat. She was not a very big one. When I got there I found out that the U-boat had blown up. It was a German U-boat.

How many times did you sink enemy submarines?

I sank five enemy submarines.

How many of your men were killed in your submarine service?

I believe I had two boats sunk and two boats damaged.

How many of your boats had five or more men killed?

I had one boat that had five men killed and another boat that had four men killed.

How many of your boats had one man killed?

I believe there was one boat that had one man killed.

Did you shoot at enemy submarines that were in the Atlantic Ocean?

I did not shoot at any enemy submarines.

Did you ever shoot at a U-boat in the North Atlantic Ocean?

I had seen several of them, but I had not been ordered to shoot at any of them.

How did you get the nickname ""Dutchman""?

When I was a boy I was in a boarding school in South Africa. There were two South African boys there. One was a white South African boy and the other was a black South African boy. The white boy and I",SM U-30 was one of 329 U-boat submarines serving in the Imperial German Navy in World War I. She engaged in commerce warfare as part of the First Battle of the Atlantic.

List some of the greatest leadership and business books ever written.,". I'm a huge fan of the book Meme Machine by Adam Grant. I think it's one of the best tools for self reflection I've ever come across.

Cultivate a habit of thinking of positive thoughts at the same time you're thinking negative thoughts.

I also think one of the most important things is to not think of negative thoughts.

I just recently finished reading ""The Power of Now"" by Eckhart Tolle. It's a great book. I think it's one of the best books I've ever read on the subject of spirituality.

I've also started reading The Art of Non-Conformity by Robert Greene. The guy who wrote ""The 48 Laws of Power"" wrote this book. I just read it and it's really good.

The book ""The Four Agreements"" is one of the best books on the subject of non-violence I've ever read.

Great list! I've been reading a ton of ""The Power of Now"" lately. I really like the idea that we can't change the past and that we have to accept it.

I really like ""The Four Agreements"" too. I've been reading it over the past few months. I think it's a great book. I also really like the concept of non-violence. I'm a huge fan of Gandhi and I think the Non-Violence movement is really important. I really like his thoughts on non-violence.

The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle has been one of my favorites for the past couple years. I've been writing about it a lot. I even went to a talk about it at a church in my town recently. It's awesome. I like the idea of thinking positive thoughts and that you can't change the past. I think it's important to not only think positive thoughts in the present but also think about the future. The more positive thoughts you have, the more positive the future will be.

I particularly like this idea from the book ""The Four Agreements"":

“Be the change you wish to see in the world. Live as if this is true. Speak and act as if it is true.”

It's interesting to me that the book is called ""The Four Agreements"". I think the idea that we can't change the past and that we have to accept it is a really good one. I think it's a great idea for positive","1. Why Should Anyone Be Led by You? by Rob Goffee

The Chichen Itza was temporarily abandoned during the time of the Spanish conquest, and its use as a ceremonial center was not resumed until the time of the Spanish Conquest. The Chichen Itza was the ceremonial center of the Maya, and was visited by many important figures in Maya history. The Chichen Itza was a center of learning and a place of great religious importance, and is therefore listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

The Chichen Itza is a collection of temples, palaces, pyramids, and other religious buildings. The central building is the Maya palace, and the palace is often referred to as the ""Key Palace.""

When asked what is his top bestselling book, Michael Pollan, an American food writer and writer for The New York Times says, ""I went to a dinner party and asked the host what was his favorite book. He said, 'I'm not a book person. But I love the book that I'm reading now.' And I was like, 'What is it?' He said, 'Citations.'"" (Pollan, quoted in The Wall Street Journal, September 27, 2010).

3. The concept of the American dream was first put forth by author and politician Theodore Roosevelt, and in his book, The New Nationalism: What It Is and How It Can Be Preserved, he states that the American dream is ""the dream of the man who, with the help of God, has made his way through the world, and who, having achieved some success, knows that he is not going to be satisfied until he reaches the top and becomes a millionaire."" (p. 7).

4. The American dream is expressed in multiple ways, including, ""The American Dream is a vision of a world where hard work, not luck, brings individuals the best of both worlds—security, prosperity, health, and the freedom to pursue their dreams."" (Lerner, 2005, p. 10).

Brainstorm reasons for and against taking a daily low-dose aspirin.," (no change) (From a clinical point of view, it is difficult to say whether this is a good or bad thing. But, in biology, it is known that daily low-dose aspirin has some beneficial effects. The effect can be thought of as a sort of homeostasis. Normally, the body does not need aspirin, but, on a daily basis, it consumes it. When we are not taking aspirin, the body is eating aspirin. When we are taking aspirin, the body is excreting aspirin. This is a good thing. The body is keeping its health at a high level. This is a good thing.) (From a biological point of view, this is an excellent example.

Finally, there’s evidence that suddenly stopping aspirin can actually increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke.

News that the government of India is considering inviting a former executive of the US government to lead the next government of India has been greeted with both hope and trepidation, especially given the failure of the Manmohan Singh government to tackle the country's most pressing problems.

Narasimha Rao, who was the last prime minister of India, served as the president of the World Bank between 1989 and 1994. He was the first Indian prime minister to serve more than two terms, and is credited with giving India a better run for its money in terms of development through his economic policies.

This piece, which originally appeared on the Indiaglue, discusses the challenges of choosing the next prime minister of India, and how the country's political system is more important than ever.

The Indian prime minister is a largely ceremonial role, and while the prime minister is usually responsible for the working of the government, the government is usually run by the cabinet. Cabinet members are accountable to the prime minister, and the prime minister has the power to dismiss them. This gives the prime minister great flexibility in how he carries out his duties.

According to the Indian constitution, the president of India is the head of state, but the prime minister has the power to make the appointment of the president. The election of the prime minister is held after the general election, and the prime minister is elected for a term of five years.

The current prime minister, Narendra Modi, has won the election with a massive majority.

The Indian prime minister is the most powerful person in the country, who is in complete control of the government. The prime minister is the official spokesperson for the government, and is the one who decides on how the government will communicate with the public, and with the world.

Prime ministers have the power to appoint and dismiss cabinet ministers.

What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?,"ue, and that you should look at your camera menu to see if it has a manual exposure mode.

A:

The answer to this question is very complex and there are a lot of factors involved.  For example, on a tripod, the field of view is a lot larger than you would get from a hand held camera.  If you have a wide-angle lens, you have to consider how much you are zooming in.  If you have a telephoto lens, you need to consider the field of view and how close you are to the subject.  A lot of people who think they know the answer to this question just pick the closest option they can.
You have to read the manual.  Many cameras have a feature to adjust the exposure while the camera is in auto mode.  It is called exposure bracketing.  The device you use to evaluate the exposure is called a meter.  Some cameras have a second meter, one that you can use to evaluate the exposure while the camera is in manual mode.
A lot of cameras also have a function that you can use to measure the light.  That is called a light meter.  It is sometimes called a light sampling device.  Many of them can take several readings and then average them.  Usually the first reading is the most accurate.
A lot of cameras also have a function that you can use to set the ISO.  That is called an automatic ISO control.  Many cameras also have a feature that you can use to set the shutter speed.  That is called an automatic aperture control.  A lot of cameras also have a feature that you can use to set the white balance.  That is called an automatic white balance.  Most of the time you should not mess with those settings unless you know what you are doing.  Some cameras also have an automatic exposure control.
Some cameras may have a feature that you can use to change the aperture and the shutter speed.  That is called an intentional aperture control.  A lot of cameras may have a feature that you can use to change the ISO.  That is called an intentional ISO control.  A lot of cameras may have a feature that you can use to change the white balance.  That is called an intentional white balance control.  The manual will explain all of these and more.  If you don't understand the manual, you might not be able to use the camera safely.  A lot of people just buy the camera, read","If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.
1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.503044,0.996846,30.546631,0.991041,0.596224,6.726757,-4.209957599639893

Does extended screen time cause speech delay in children?,"itation of the American Academy of Pediatrics

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is the national society of clinicians who specialize in pediatrics, covering health and development across the lifespan. The AAP’s mission, as stated in its mission statement, is to promote the health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and adults; to prevent illness and disability; to promote and maintain the health of infants, children, and adolescents by providing authoritative medical information; and to protect and promote health and well-being in the community.

The AAP is the largest organization of its kind in the world. Over 7,000 medical, scientific, and lay individuals, from all parts of the United States, collaborate to carry out AAP's mission of caring for the nation's children.

According to a study conducted by the AAP, the prevalence of childhood obesity in the United States has increased to nearly 11% of preschool children, and a number of adverse health effects have been associated with obesity. The AAP states that obesity is “associated with increased risk for many chronic diseases, including asthma, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Obesity and overweight in children can also lead to mental health problems including emotional and behavioral problems and impaired social skills.” The AAP warns that children with overweight and obesity are at increased risk for other health conditions as well, including hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.

The AAP warns that children who are obese have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes. The risk for developing type 2 diabetes increases exponentially as the child becomes an adult.

The AAP warns specifically that “excessive screen time (television, video games, and computer use) may lead to an increased risk of obesity and other health problems in children and adolescents.”

The AAP states that children and adolescents who are obese are at increased risk for several chronic health conditions, including hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. The AAP states that obesity in children and adolescents is associated with compromised social skills in which overweight and obese adolescents are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.

The AAP states that overweight and obese children and adolescents are at increased risk for mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

What did Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, die from?

Steve Jobs, who died on Wednesday aged 56, was the founder of the company that would go on to become one of the most successful and well-known tech companies of all time. As the founding CEO of Apple, he built the company from a single employee into a global giant, but his greatest legacy is arguably that of the human who revolutionised the computer industry.

In an interview with The Guardian, the late Apple co-founder was asked what he thought of his legacy.

""I guess it's kind of like saying I've never been a movie star, but I'm sure that's what I'm going to be remembered most for. I think it's really unfortunate that it's going to be overshadowed by the other stuff.""

The legendary designer had a strong work ethic, but for all his success, Jobs was also a deeply private man, who battled a number of serious illnesses and depression. In a 2005 interview with the New Yorker, Jobs revealed that he had attempted suicide in 1985, but that he had made a full recovery. He also revealed that he was suicidal when he was younger.

""I was a very, very different person when I was 21 than I am now,"" he said. ""I don't think I ever really recovered from that.""

""I've lived a very, very full life,"" he continued. ""And so I guess my only regret is that I didn't do more of it. I wish I had spent more time. I wish I had less regrets.""

Jobs was also a major philanthropist. In 2008, he helped found the Steve Wozniak Foundation. The foundation provides resources, such as computers, to underprivileged students.

""We're trying to create an environment where people can have a better life,"" Jobs said. ""The mission of the foundation is to help people, whether it's in Silicon Valley or anywhere else.""

Jobs' last words, according to the Guardian: ""I may not be around forever. But I want to be around for a long time.""",Steve Jobs died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer.,0.005947,0.997724,9.735754,0.985675,0.004703,2.345961,-4.429220676422119

Moreover, sports are one of the most important components of the youth's lives, providing opportunities for social, physical and emotional development. Significant positive health outcomes may be linked to participation in sport. One of the most important aspects of sports participation is the development of the youth's self-esteem, which in turn, enhances their growth and development in the context of life. On the other hand, some negative outcomes can arise from participation in sport. These include injury, boredom, and a lack of self-esteem. If participation in sport is to be effective, then the sporting team should seek to maintain the highest levels of safety for all individuals playing the game (e.g. players, officials, team officials, and bystanders). Also, the sporting team should seek to minimize the risk of injury for all individuals involved in the game.

Please give me a summary of what AES-GCM is and what are its inputs and outputs.,"um`s AES-GCM is a variant of AES-GCM, which is a mode of operation to encrypt data using short block cipher inputs and not simply the full AES block key. The AES-GCM mode is a combination of the cipher AES with a keyed cipher block chaining (CBC). This mode is defined in the AES standard and part of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The standard is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a public key cryptography algorithm. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is an encryption algorithm that can protect data from unauthorized access.

The AES is a symmetric-key algorithm. The AES also is an asymmetric-key algorithm, meaning that the key used for encryption cannot be used for decryption. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a block cipher mode of operation. The block cipher is a type of one-way cryptography algorithm that is faster to execute than symmetric-key algorithms.

Classic literature explores great questions of human experience, from the folly of hubris to the meaning of life.

Classics have been part of the Western literary canon for many centuries. They offer both characters and ideas that can be found in our own time. They also offer enduring truths that can help us understand our own lives and those of other people.

"Tell me whether those are countries or cities: Paris, Amsterdam, South Africa, Australia, Vienna, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Argentina",". Mordecai's first question is to ask whether we can trust our own government. This may seem like a silly question. But the world is full of governments that are more or less trustworthy. We can trust the United States government, for example, to some extent. We can't trust the government of Singapore, which is a dictatorship. We can't trust the government of Saudi Arabia, which is a nation with no respect for human rights. We can't trust the government of Canada, which, if anything, is even more corrupt than the United States government. We can't trust the government of Australia, which is a society that is often very racist. It's not difficult to see why Mordecai is interested in asking this kind of question. If a government is corrupt, it will be difficult to know whether it's telling the truth. In order to have any confidence in the truthfulness of a government, we must be able to trust it to be truthful. But Mordecai does not trust the government of the United States. In fact, he's very doubtful about the truthfulness of the United States government. Why does he doubt the truthfulness of the United States government? What makes him doubt the truthfulness of the United States government? What makes him doubt the truthfulness of the United States government? Well, first of all, there's the fact that the United States government is run by Donald Trump. In addition, Donald Trump is a very untrustworthy person. Donald Trump is a very untrustworthy person. The fact that Donald Trump is a very untrustworthy person makes it more difficult to trust the United States government. Mordecai also has a very negative attitude toward the United States government. He thinks that it's unfair and unreasonable that Donald Trump, the president, is allowed to be more powerful than the Supreme Court of the United States. Mordecai points out that Donald Trump is allowed to make decisions without any accountability. Mordecai points out that Donald Trump is allowed to make decisions without any accountability.

You can get a free credit report from each of the three big credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. If you use a credit score to compare banks or to apply for a loan, you should know how the credit bureaus calculate your credit score. You can also get a free credit score from each of the three bureaus.

If you have a poor credit score, you may not get a loan or a credit card—but a low credit score does not mean you are a bad person. Instead, it is a reflection of how you've behaved in the past, and how you will behave in the future. If you have a poor credit score, you are in the same boat as many people who have low credit scores. You may have a spotty credit history, or you may have been in one or more unfortunate financial or legal situations.

The credit bureaus may not have this information (or may not have it in a timely manner), so you can call them to get your credit score. The credit bureaus ask for your name, address, birth date, social security number, and date of birth. You can also get a free credit report from each of the three bureaus.

Just because you can get a free credit report and score doesn't mean you should. If you have a poor credit score, you should also consider getting a free copy of your credit report from each of the three bureaus.

But this is why I'm here: to give you the most interesting moons in our solar system, as well as the most interesting planets in our solar system.

Here's what I'm going to do:

First, I'm going to declare which object I think is the most interesting, based on its orbit and its moons. So, first I'll name my object.

And of course, it will be the Sun.

Now, I'm going to list all the objects in our solar system that are orbited by moons.

I'm going to give each of these moons a little tag:

Mare Imbrium

Mare Imbrium is a large, icy moon of Jupiter that orbits the planet's north pole. It is the fourth largest moon of Jupiter, and the fifth largest object in the solar system (after the planet Mercury, Pluto, and Eris). It is also the largest of the Galilean moons.

It is named after the Roman name for the region of Sicily known as the Ionian Sea: the Mare Imbrium.

Mare Imbrium was discovered in 1882 when it was discovered by Heinrich Louis d'Arrest in the Mariner 9 probe, and was named after the region of Sicily known as the Ionian Sea.

D'Arrest also discovered the satellites of Mare Imbrium: Mare Imbrium 1 and Mare Imbrium 2. Mare Imbrium 2 was named after the region of Sicily known as the Ionian Sea, while Mare Imbrium 1 was named after the family name of the discoverer, Louis d'Arrest, and his daughter Marie.

Mare Imbrium is about 18,000 kilometers in diameter (the sixth largest moon in the solar system), and has a surface gravity of about 5.5 times Earth's surface gravity.

D'Arrest and the","- Ganymede: Bigger than the planet Mercury, the largest moon in the solar system contains subsurface oceans that could be capable of supporting life.
- Titan: The second largest moon in the solar system and the only celestial body other than Earth to have both a substantial atmosphere and bodies of surface water.
- Io: This moon of Jupiter is so full of volcanos that it is the most geologically active and lowest water ratio object in the solar system.
- Callisto: May be the oldest surface in the solar system. With a thin atmosphere and no geothermal activity its surface is defined by the many impact craters it has accumulated over time.
- Europa: The smallest moon of Jupiter contains a subsurface layer of saltwater ocean that could also support life. It also has plumes of water that are several miles high.
- Mimas: This moon of Saturn has a massive crater that makes it look like the Death Star from Star Wars.",0.003742,0.919838,12.520171,0.738924,0.003888,2.837312,-8.054587364196777

","Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting hit by falling windows detached from tall building by strong winds from cyclones or tornadoes: 
1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway.

Name some famous anime shows?,"-chan 4chan trolling.

As for your guess some of you might be right. I just recently added the ""Hentai"" screencap and that's a good guess. As for the name you are right about the word ""snow"" and for the title of a song ""Anime"".

you should have a picture of hynto from the show Paradise Kiss, you know it is one of my fav show. I have it on my fav list on Bitchute.

I am sure that there is a picture in the gallery of the Dekimakyu but I wasn't able to find it.

The picture of the harem girl is also from the show Paradise Kiss.

I am leaving this thread now because I have to go and see some shows that I've heard about but I don't have time to watch especially since I'm broke. I hope there are some others that can help me watch shows.

I'm not sure if this is the right thread but I'll ask anyway.

I have a couple of questions about anime that I'd like to get some answers for.

1) I am not sure if I have understood correctly but it seems like the word ""incest"" is mentioned in a lot of anime. For example the only anime I know to have incest in it is ""Sword Art Online"" and I have read that the incest theme is also in ""The Brink of Life"", ""Mushishi"" and ""Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo"".

2) I have read that in anime there are a lot of sexual content which is often related with incest. For example in ""Sword Art Online"" the main characters have sex in their bedroom and in ""The Brink of Life"" there is a scene where a girl is raped.

3) I have heard that in anime there is lots of rape and murder. Is this true?

1) Incest is absolutely forbidden and never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever. You are not allowed to think about it in your mind even if you have been taught that in school. This is just like any other taboo subject.

2) Yes. ""Sword Art Online"" is an anime that deals with incest very openly, and it is also one of the most popular anime of all time.

3) Yes. See #1

4) No","Attack on Titan, Naruto, Dragon Ball, Bleach, One Piece",0.025301,0.455773,14.088385,0.043934,0.022001,2.927079,-5.621007442474365

Sorry, I didn't mean to put ""panties"" in the title for the 3rd time now.

That was the first time I ever saw that episode, and I was a little bit disappointed by it. The animation was not very good in that episode, and it seemed like Senku was acting like an idiot in that episode.

I didn't like the fact that they were all looking at the same thing at the same time... it was like the ""big"" vision.

I'm sure the show has improved, but that episode really let me down.

I don't know if you've noticed, but this show is incredibly repetitive and predictable. Maybe I'll watch it again to see if it's better than I remember it being.

The show isn't better than I remember it. I was watching it at the same time as you, and it wasn't better than I remembered. I am not interested in watching it again, because it's not something I wanted to see in the first place.

Ok then. I do not like anime/manga where the hero is a guy. I will watch animes like that if they have a girl that is powerful and good at soccer or something.

Well, you could watch Bleach if you want, since it's a somewhat same story as WoD.

I can't speak for Bleach because I haven't watched it, but I had to walk out of WoD after a few episodes because the plot was absolutely absurd.

And I have to agree with you that the show is very repetitive. There are so many episodes like that, but I have to give it some credit for being utterly graphically stunning, especially in the first season.

Describe the governing arrangements provided by the Articles of Confederation. What were the main weaknesses of the document?,"ate in the Convention’s failure to include a provision for a national defense. The new national government created by the Articles of Confederation lacked the power to provide for a national defense. The Framers did not see a need for such a provision, but they were concerned about the inability to provide for a defense in the event of war.

What were the major political and economic problems?

The agreement to leave the military and police affairs of the states to state governments was a major step toward the creation of a federal government. The states were not in a position to do anything more than provide for their own defense. The states had to give up control over their internal affairs and in return, the states would give up their control over federal affairs. The states would have to give up a great deal of their power and this would make their government weak. It was not possible to give up the federal government’s power without giving up some of the states’ power. There were also economic problems with the new federal government. The states were still dependent on the land they held. The new government could not provide land for the states. Furthermore, the new government had to provide for the services necessary to maintain the states. These services required money. The states had to borrow money in order to provide for these services. The new government had to abandon the principle of paying for services with taxes. The states could not afford to pay for services with taxes.

How did the states respond to the Articles of Confederation? What did the states do? The states responded by adopting a new constitution. The new constitution was an attempt to solve the problems of the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution of the United States gave the states more power to solve their own problems. The states began making improvements in their internal politics. They began to set up judicial systems to deal with various kinds of cases. They also set up a system to deal with grievances. The states began to adopt more effective measures to deal with their economic problems. The states began to create schemes to tax and borrow money. The states began to establish a system of courts to handle cases.

What was the effect of the Constitution of the United States? What was the effect of the Constitution of the United States on the Articles of Confederation? The Constitution of the United States was the greatest change in the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution of the United States did not solve any of the major problems of the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution of the United States did not solve the states","The Articles of Confederation (AoC) was the first written constitution of the United States. There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the",0.207819,0.996587,30.651961,0.990788,0.265517,6.622534,-3.413086414337158

What is a Tommy John Surgery?," in the throwing a

The Tommy John Surgery is a procedure named for Tommy John, the former pitcher for the Boston Red Sox. Tommy John underwent surgery to remove a torn ACL in his right knee in 1991. The procedure is known as Tommy John surgery because the actual name is ""Tommy John surgery."" The procedure was performed by Dr. James Andrews, but it is now performed by Dr. Neal ElAttrache. The surgery is performed to remove the torn ACL. The torn ACL is the ligament that connects the thigh to the shin. The purpose of the surgery is to reattach the ACL to the bone. The surgery can be performed on the left or on the right knee. The surgery is performed with a small incision, and the surgeon may place a metal pin to support the ligament. The recovery time depends on the severity of the injury. The recovery time usually takes about 4–6 weeks.

What are the possible complications of the Tommy John Surgery?

The most common complication of the Tommy John Surgery is a reoccurrence of the injury. The reoccurrence of the injury is called a retear. A retear occurs if the ligament is reattached to the bone in such a way that it does not hold the knee in place. The injury may be reattached to the bone by a fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue may stay attached to the bone for the rest of the patient’s life. In addition, the injury may reattach to the bone by a bony nodule. The bony nodule is a hard spot on the bone that may cause a bending sensation. The reoccurrence of the injury is called a retear because it is repositioned on the bone. The reattached ligament may be reattached to the bone by a fibrous tissue. The fibrous tissue may stay attached to the bone for the rest of the patient’s life. In addition, the injury may reattach to the bone by a bony nodule. The bony nodule is a hard spot on the bone that may cause a bending sensation. The reoccurrence of the injury is called a retear because it is repositioned on the bone. A second complication of the Tommy John Surgery is injury to the meniscus. The meniscus is the cartilage that fills the front part of the knee. The injury to the meniscus may be caused by the surgeon not taking the meniscus out before the surgery. In addition, the injury may be caused by the surgeon not taking the","A surgical graft procedure where the ulnar collateral ligament in the medial elbow is replaced with either a tendon from elsewhere in the patient's body, or with one from a deceased donor.",0.025741,0.654003,24.520549,0.829109,0.027759,5.211432,-3.230433702468872

What country was Frida Kahlo from and what career was she famous for?,".

This is a very personal question. But since there is no answer to this question on Wikipedia, I thought I would ask it here. As you know, Frida Kahlo is a Mexican painter who was famous for her self-portraits. She was also known for her political activism. Wikipedia has a nice article on her. But there is no article on her nationality and her career. I have a lot of questions here, but I would like to know if there is a way to become more informed about her.

Answer & Support

Answer:

Frida Kahlo was born on November 24, 1907 in Coyoacán, Mexico City.

She is a famous painter. People often call her a self-portrait painter. She was born in a very rich family, and she was very important to her family. But she was also very lonely. She spent a lot of time alone in a garden. She had lots of interests and was very creative. She is known as the Mexican painter of the 20th century.

Kahlo was born in 1907, in a large family of artists. Her father was a painter and her mother was a self-taught art teacher. Kahlo and her family moved to Coyoacán, a wealthy district of Mexico City. This was the only part of Mexico City that had a lot of artistic talent.

Kahlo grew up in a very artistic environment. Her father, Diego Rivera, was an important Mexican artist in the 20th century. Her mother, Laura Alfaro, was a self-taught artist.

In 1912, Kahlo’s family moved to Mexico City, where her father had become famous. Kahlo was devoting most of her time to painting. She was looking at her own image all the time.

She studied at the Escuela Nacional Preparatoria. In 1925, she graduated from this school. In 1927, she became the first student of the Escuela de Bellas Artes where she studied with Antonio Berni.

In 1928, Kahlo was admitted to the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado. She studied there until 1930. Kahlo made many self-portraits during this time.

In 1930, she met Diego Rivera, who was an important Mexican artist in the 20th century. Kahlo and Diego Rivera were friends for many years.",Frida Kahlo is a well known Mexican artist,0.276263,0.99861,31.249822,0.995353,0.234304,6.75087,-4.679488658905029

What is Freeride snowboarding?,"ment and Freeride snowboarding are different.



Freeride snowboarding is the combination of snowboarding and ski-mountaineering. Ski mountaineering is a type of skiing that involves skis and a climbing harness. There are many ways that freeride snowboarding can be practiced, but a classic example of freeride snowboarding involves riding down a mountain on a snowboard with a rope attached to a ski boot and climbing down on a rope fixed to a harness. This type of snowboarding is often referred to as ""snowboarding off-piste.""



Whilst off-piste snowboarding is a very common way to snowboard, it is also one of the most dangerous ways to snowboard. The main reason is the difficulty of performing a ""snowboard turn"" which is a move where the rider turns their snowboard sideways whilst remaining on the snowboard. This is a maneuver that requires both the rider and the snowboard to be in perfect balance, which is difficult to achieve when attached to a rope and when the snowboard is moving at high speeds.

I’m a retired English teacher and writer, and I’ve taught thousands of kids and grown children books.

I live in Virginia with my wife, Sue, and we have a house full of books. We live with a garden full of vegetables, fruit, and herbs.

"Let’s solve the following math problem. Each rabbit has 4 feets and each duck has 2 feets. If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?","ulet is the answer.

Now that we have solved for the number of rabbits, how do we solve for the number of ducks?

First, we divide 88 by 25. 88/25 = 3.88.

Therefore, 3.88 is the number of ducks that we need to add to the number of rabbits to equal the number of feets.

The number of rabbits is the number of feets minus 3.88. Therefore, the number of rabbits is 88-3.88 = 85.

The number of ducks is 3.88 plus the number of rabbits. Therefore, 3.88 + 85 = 88.

Therefore, the number of ducks is 88 + 3.88 = 91.

Unfortunately, the number of rabbits is not the sum of the number of ducks and the number of feets. Therefore, the number of rabbits is not the sum of the number of ducks and the number of feets. Therefore, the number of rabbits is not the sum of the number of ducks and the number of feets. Therefore, the answer is not in the table you provided.

I agree that you have not solved the problem properly. However, the number of rabbits is not the sum of the number of ducks and the number of feets.

Let the number of ducks be X and the number of rabbits be Y.
We have X + Y = 25 and 2X + 4Y = 88.
Simplifying the first equation, we get Y = 25 - X
Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88
Which means 2X = 100 – 88 = 12, thus X = 6.
We substitute back into the first equation, we have Y = 25 - 6 = 19.

"Classify each job as a ""blue collar"" or ""white collar"" job: auditor, electrician, plumber, data scientist, financial analyst, construction worker"," with a first-year assistant for one hour a week in your budget to make sure you're not overspending.

For each of these jobs, you'll need to know what your ""fair market wage"" is in that country. Once you have that number, just multiply it by the number of hours you're looking to work.

You'll also need to know your ""average wage,"" or the average hourly wage for that country. You can find this number by dividing the ""fair market wage"" for a given job by the number of hours you need to work.

For example, if I'm an electrician in California, I know that the average hourly wage for an electrician is $20. I need to know what my ""fair market wage"" is, so I divide $20 by 40 hours per week (my number of hours per week in a week). That's $5.

Once you have your ""fair market wage"" and your ""average wage,"" you can make a budget. You can use either a spreadsheet or a calculator to make this budget.

Adding it all up

When you have your budget set up, you can add it all up to find your ""take home pay."" This is usually the amount of money you'll get after paying all of your bills, insurance, taxes, and any other expenses that you incur.

the very fact that there is a highly developed and highly organized
religion, which has as its chief object the attainment of a state of
perfection, it is very evident that there must be a body of men who
have been trained to the highest degree of the powers of the mind that
could possibly be possessed by man, who are so organized as to be able
to attain such a state of perfection as that which the religion of
Mormonism claims.

It is a common thing to hear people talk about the doctrines of the
Mormon religion as being the most absurd and preposterous of any

"Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Derkach, Lyra","ation, Posa, etc.""

A:

According to the instructions of the answer above I found the answer.
""Instrument"" is a relative term. It can be applied to string or percussion.
For string instruments, the term ""string instrument"" is used.
If the instrument is not a string instrument, the term ""percussion instrument"" would be more appropriate.
Examples:
Percussion instruments:
- Wurlitzer
- acoustic piano
- xylophone
- snare drum
- tambourine
- bass drum
- claves
- chimes
- drum machine
- sitar
String instruments:
- violin
- viola
- cello
- double bass
- banjo
- koto
- mandolin
- guitar
- ukulele
- bass guitar

A:

The answer by @Michael-Grunwald is right.  Strings are ""strings"", and percussion is ""percussion"".
However, that answer is not complete.  If you want to use a guitar as a string instrument, you can.  It's a guitar, so its strings are called ""strings"".  But you can also use it as a percussion instrument.  It's a guitar, so it's called ""percussion"" or ""percussion instrument"", not ""strings instrument"".  You can also use it as a ""string instrument"" in some contexts, just not as a ""string instrument"" in the usual sense.

What is a quantum computer?,", a computer that is built of quantum bits, or ""qubits"", that can be in more than one state at a time. Although previously thought to be impossible, theoretical computer scientists have demonstrated that it is possible to construct a quantum computer with a number of qubits that is exponentially larger than the number of qubits that would be required to simulate the world with classical computers. The most fundamental unit of a quantum computer is a qubit, which can be either in the state 0 or 1. A quantum computer can be thought of as a system of connected qubits. A quantum circuit is a series of quantum gates that can be used to manipulate the state of the quantum computer.A quantum computer is based on the laws of quantum physics, rather than the laws of classical physics. The laws of quantum physics are more complicated than classical physics, and can be used to model more complex phenomena than the classical world, such as the behavior of atoms. A quantum computer can solve certain problems that are impossible or at least extremely difficult to solve with classical computers. In principle, a quantum computer can solve problems that would be impossible for a classical computer to solve.A quantum computer can be built with a variety of physical devices. Although it is not yet possible to build a quantum computer using conventional semiconductor devices, the integration of quantum bits into integrated circuits is a major research focus. A quantum computer can be built using a variety of different quantum technologies. For example, a quantum computer could be built using superconducting quantum bits, trapped ions, quantum dots, and other materials.A quantum computer can handle a much larger number of qubits than a classical computer can. Although a classical computer can handle many more qubits than a quantum computer, a quantum computer can handle a much larger number of qubits than a classical computer can.

For example, a classical computer can be built with 48 bits, but a quantum computer can be built with 1024 bits.

A quantum computer can have an exponential improvement in speed over a classical computer. The speed of a quantum computer can be measured in terms of the number of operations that can be performed per second. If a quantum computer can solve a problem in a time that is exponential times faster than a classical computer can solve the problem, it is said to have an exponential speedup. For example, a quantum computer running on superconducting qubits could solve a problem in a time that is exponential times faster than a classical computer running on a conventional computer could solve the problem.

A quantum computer can be built using conventional semiconductor devices.

A quantum computer can","A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.282672,0.993,18.902943,0.985336,0.369212,4.306633,-3.494866371154785

What is the difference between whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES)?,": The goal of WGS and WES is to sequence whole chromosomes or whole exons of the genome. WGS is a much larger and more complex undertaking than WES, and so the resulting sequences are not as useful for medical purposes as the exome. However, WES is sometimes used to identify variants in the exome, which are not found by WGS. One reason for this is that WES, unlike WGS, is only able to capture a small portion of the genome, while WGS can capture the entire genome. Thus, WES is able to find variants that WGS is unable to identify. Another reason is that WES is able to use the additional sequence from the whole genome that WGS misses, which is called the complement of the exome. Thus, WES can find variants that WGS cannot find. Finally, the variants identified by WES may be more clinically relevant, as they can be found in regions that have little or no variation in healthy individuals. However, the limitation of WES is that it cannot locate variants in regions that are not sequenced.

It\'s a good idea to talk to your doctor before you undergo WES or WGS.

I\'m curious, what are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

Raghunatha Bhat: There are three main advantages to WGS. First, WGS is a much larger and more complex undertaking than WES. Second, WES is sometimes used to identify variants in the exome, which are not found by WGS. Finally, the variants identified by WES may be more clinically relevant, as they can be found in regions that have little or no variation in healthy individuals. However, the limitation of WES is that it cannot locate variants in regions that are not sequenced.

What is the cost of WGS?

Raghunatha Bhat: The cost of WGS has decreased significantly over the past few years. In 2013, whole genome sequencing was \$2,000, but in December 2016, it was \$1,000. The price of WES has also decreased over the same time period.

I\'m curious, when do you recommend doing a WES and when do you recommend WGS?

Raghunatha Bhat: WES is a much more affordable option than WGS if you have a limited number of people with the disease and are willing to use less information.

What do you think of this year’s World Cup? What do you think of the players? I think the World Cup is often seen as a bit of a high-profile party, but it’s really important to have the World Cup on the calendar. And I think this year it’s going to be a real, real good tournament. And I think there’s so many great players. I think you’ve got to be a bit careful with who you pick to play, because there’s so many great players.

Why did you decide to create a “World Cup of the cities” instead of just a “World Cup of the nations?” Because the countries, they’re all great players, but I think a lot of people think that Russia is the only country that can win a World Cup, and I think there’s a lot of other countries that can do it as well. So I think it’s really important that you pick the city that teaches you something about the country.

Are you surprised by the number of people who want to watch the World Cup on TV? I think that’s really great. I think that the World Cup is going to be great television, I really do.

Do you think this will be the last World Cup? You know, what I think is that there will be a lot of World Cups. There’s going to be a lot of World Cups in the future. We’","- New Zealand

Boston is the capital and largest city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the cultural and financial center of the New England region of the Northeastern United States. The city boundaries encompass an area of about 48.4 sq mi (125 km2) and a population of 675,647 as of 2020. The city is the economic and cultural anchor of a substantially larger metropolitan area known as Greater Boston, a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 4.8 million people in 2016 and ranking as the tenth-largest MSA in the country. 

Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in America, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula in 1630 by Puritan settlers from the English town of the same name. It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution and the nation's founding, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture.

The United States will remain the largest producer of natural gas in the world for the next 20 years, and the biggest consumer of coal for the next 20 years, according to the International Energy Outlook, a new report from the Energy Information Administration.

The report also predicts that the world will become increasingly energy-dependent on China, which will become the largest consumer of natural gas in 2022.

There are notable shifts in the energy markets, which do not occur in a vacuum. The report notes that the U.S. has been successful in shifting away from oil to natural gas, because the price of natural gas is much cheaper than that of oil. Also, the higher cost of reducing carbon emissions has led to a growing shift to natural gas as an alternative to coal in the United States.

And the U.S. has been successful in shifting away from coal to natural gas. The price of natural gas is much cheaper than that of coal, but there are other factors that have caused the shift in the past 10 years. The price of natural gas has been rising faster than that of coal for most of the decade. Also, natural gas is increasingly being used as an alternative to coal in the United States, because the cost of reducing carbon emissions has been rising, and natural gas is a source of clean power.

The world, therefore, is moving in a direction that is favorable for the United States, but it is also moving in the direction that is unfavorable for China, which is expected to become the largest consumer of natural gas in the world by 2022. The report also notes that China is also expected to become the largest producer of coal in the world by 2022.

While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end.

What is the capital of Arizona?,"

I'm sorry to hear that. I wish I knew the answers to these questions (though in all honesty I'm not sure I would know what the correct answers are)

So I guess the question is, what do we know about the chances of these questions being asked?

Certainly, it seems like it would be a very difficult task to find a person who has done so for any particular reason, and I am sure it is not a priority for someone to make a list of such questions.

I've been trying to think of something that would make such questions more likely, but I can't think of one.

I know I can't think of any reason that questions about what the capital of a state would be asked, and I don't think I would do it if I was asked.

I feel like I'd just be lying, but I'm wondering if it's also possible to have a personal reason for doing something like this.

I could be the only one asking questions about the capital of the state. I could be the only one paying attention to what people are asking. I could be the only one who is interested in knowing.

What do you think?

It's also worth noting that the questions listed above were all asked in the past year, and all of the questions were asked on a one-time basis.

I generally think it's unlikely to be a one-time thing. The most likely explanation seems to be that someone has a personal interest in knowing the answer to these questions, and they're trying to find out whether they're a person who would do such a thing or not. Or maybe they're trying to find out whether they can get away with it.

If they're trying to find out the answer to these questions for some reason, then the only way it could be done is by someone who has a personal interest in knowing.

I don't think these questions would be asked if everyone was as interested in the answer as the people who asked them.

If someone has a personal interest in knowing the answer to this kind of question, then the only way it could be done is by someone who has a personal interest in knowing.

"Given the paragraph about the Colnago C40, in which year was a Colnago-branded bicycle first ridden by the overall classification winner in the Tour de France?","ment

The answer is that it was not a Colnago-branded bike, but a Colnago-branded frame with a Colnago-branded fork.

However, it is true that the C40 was first ridden by the overall classification winner in the Tour de France.

Andrzej Błaszczyk, a Polish cyclist, finished second in the Tour in 1998 and won the young rider classification. He rode a Colnago-branded C40 during the 1998 Tour de France.

""During the 1998 Tour de France, I rode a Colnago-branded C40 from the age of eleven,"" Błaszczyk told Cyclingnews.

""I did not promote this bike, but I did not discourage this bike either.""

The C40 was a new frame with a new fork and mech. It was a very good bike, but not the best bike in the world.

""It was a very good bike, but not the best bike in the world,"" Błaszczyk said.

The C40 was the result of innovative design, from the front fork to the rear mech, and the front mech to the rear mech.

""The front mech was a big design secret,"" Błaszczyk said. ""The rear mech was a small design secret.

""The front mech was very innovative. It was a half-sleeved mech that folded down. It was an original idea. The rear mech was a very simple design. It was compact and simple.

""The front mech was like a third leg on the bike. The wheel was balanced, but the bike was more balanced than if just the wheel was balanced.""

Błaszczyk said that the C40 was the best bike for him at the time.

""I really liked it,"" Błaszczyk said. ""I liked the whole bike. It was the best bike for me at the time.

""I rode the bike because I was happy with it. It was the best bike for me at the time. I was happy with it, but I did not promote it.""

Błaszczyk's first victory in the Tour de France was in 1998.

""It is the only victory I have in the Tour de France,"" Błaszczyk said.

How can a technical expert identify a business use case?,"The way a business uses a particular technology is an important part of its overall strategy. And if you’re a technical expert, you need to know what they’re doing to make sure you’re delivering the right solution for them.

How can a business use tech?

This question is the basis of much of the debate around what a tech stack is. Is it a list of technologies? A toolset? Or do you need a comprehensive solution to address a business need?

In my opinion, it’s time to move past the idea that you need to put enough technologies together to create a solution. Because, in a lot of cases, you can get by with a lot less.

The right tech stack will give you the tools you need to deliver the right solution for your business. You don’t need to go out and purchase 10,000 technologies to solve a problem. You just need to know which ones to focus on.

While we talked, I noticed that her tech stack was very sparse. The products that she most relied on were Salesforce and Box.

She was using a fairly simple custom application to manage the workflow. Her only ‘tech’ was the Salesforce connectors that she used to manage her contacts.

As we talked, I noticed that her only tools for her team were Google Docs and a simple mail merge. I asked her what technology she was using to manage the workflow, and she said that she had no idea. When I asked her what she needed to do to make it work correctly, she said that she couldn’t do it.

I asked her if there was any way I could help her out. She said that there wasn’t, and I asked her why. She said that she was using Salesforce to manage her contacts, and that she couldn’t get Salesforce to communicate with Box.

To me this was a prime example of the “too many technologies” problem. She had a basic toolset that was working, but the problem was that she didn’t know how to use it to solve her problem.

So, I said to her, “You can’t do that. You need to","Often enterprises need help when a business user and technical expert try to define a business use case.  A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.
1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.
5. Build technical capabilities that",0.653097,0.996554,20.111855,0.970449,0.744731,4.695337,-4.2997212409973145

Why would anyone go river rafting?,"il o clindadeis a popular recreational activity in the United States. The cost of the trip is usually between $200 and $500 and it is common to see people with as little as a few days of training go on the trip. The most important reason to go is to enjoy a day on the river. There are many types of river rafting trips that range in difficulty and a person can easily find a trip that suits their level of experience. The most popular type of river rafting is white water rafting, which involves rivers that are fast moving and also get the most water. This is a popular activity in the United States because white water rafting is the most popular activity for people who are looking for the adrenaline rush of a river trip.

For the adrenaline junkie, white water rafting is a must. These trips are fun, exciting and provide the thrill of a lifetime to the person who has the desire to go on one. For those who are looking for something a little more relaxing and more sedate, there are other types of river rafting that are a little more traditional, such as kayaking. Kayaking is a fun activity that is not only relaxing but also provides the necessary relaxation that the adrenaline junkie craves. This is because the activity is relatively easy and takes less effort than white water rafting, which makes it a great choice for the person who has decided to take a rest day from rafting. There are also waterfalls that are popular in the United States and these falls are a great way to get the adrenaline rush that the adrenaline junkie is looking for.

River rafting is a fun activity that can be enjoyed by anyone and any age, and there are no age restrictions. Anyone can enjoy this activity, because the person who has the desire to go on a river trip is the one who goes. There are many different types of trips that people go on, and these trips range from short trips to longer trips. For people who want to see the whole river or want to see as much as possible, going on longer trips are ideal. There are also different types of rivers that people go on, and these can range from fast flowing rivers such as white water to slow flowing rivers such as blue water. This is because the person who wants to see as much as possible as possible will want to go on a trip that allows them to see the whole river.

Why was America called the New World?," for its great fertility.

natives of America, of course, are native-born.

rban, there are good reasons the Bible doesn't say the world,

They are the same reasons that Bill O'Reilly is a smart guy and a professional liar:

(1) if it did, he would have said it when he said the world was round, and he didn't.

(2) the world is not round, and (3) the Bible is not a book about how the world is round.

Just as there are good reasons for the Bible not to say the world WAS flat, there are good reasons for the Bible not to say the world *is* round. The fact that the world is round, and that the Bible is not about how it is round, is what the argument is about.

We all have an intuitive understanding of what a book of Revelation is: it is an extended vision of the end of the world.

But there are other ideas about the book that are not intuitive.

One is that it is a book about how the world is going to end.

If that is the case, then it is not a book about the end of the world. It is a book about how the world is going to end.

Another idea is that it is a book about personal salvation, and that it is used to show that Jesus is the only way to salvation.

If that is the case, it is not a book about the end of the world. It is a book about how the world is going to end, and it is a book about how to get into heaven.

Give me a bulleted list with 5 reasons why is Lyft's stock is underperforming Uber's.," Lyft is a company that has been able to keep expenses down and maintain an attractive valuation. Lyft has been able to use its growth to leverage market share and is now a growing global player, which should keep its stock price appreciating.

According to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors, home sales were up 11.8 percent in March compared to the previous month, marking the tenth consecutive month of year-over-year increase. Another report from the National Association of Realtors showed that home prices in March increased 2.6 percent from a year earlier, marking the fifth consecutive month of year-over-year gains.

The second quarter earnings report from Lyft and Uber are pretty impressive. In Q2, Lyft saw earnings of $210 million, or $1.53 per share, compared to $184 million, or $1.27 per share, in the second quarter of 2017. Lyft, which was up 4 percent year-over-year, sees 10 percent growth in rides per month.

Lyft investors are pleased with their stock's performance, which has been underperforming its peers recently, but it will have to do quite a bit better to beat Uber. The stock has been a target of investors since Uber's IPO in November. Lyft is down $5.90, or 7.36 percent, to $41.78, while Uber is up 1.5 percent to $1,253.

Lyft is up 9.1 percent in 2017, while Uber is up just 0.5 percent.

Lyft's Stock Is Up, But It Could Drop Further

Lyft is seeing some of the same issues that Uber is dealing with. Lyft is still trying to negotiate a new deal with the California Public Utilities Commission, which could slow down the rollout of the Lyft Line. Lyft is hoping that the new deal will be approved by the end of the year.

Lyft also has to deal with a number of other legal issues, including a lawsuit filed against the company by Waymo, the Google subsidiary that is building self-driving cars. Waymo claims that Lyft doesn't pay its drivers the full amount that it owes them, and that Lyft drivers are working for Uber instead of Lyft. Lyft says that it is not involved with Waymo's lawsuit.

Lyft is the biggest competitor that Uber has faced. Lyft has been able to acquire companies that","The following are 5 reasons Lyft's stock is underperforming Uber's:
1. Lyft is losing marketshare to Uber across all markets
2. Lyft has a bloated cost structure with very high stock based compensation costs
3. Lyft rides cost more than Uber's on average
4. Drivers make less on Lyft than Uber

List the British prime ministers since world war 2,".

The British prime minster and the leader of the opposition in the British parliament are elected by the people of the United Kingdom to form a government.

They are voted into office by members of parliament and may be removed from office if they do not win the confidence of the majority of members in the house.

A prime minister is an elected official who leads a country and runs its government. The office was first created in 1807 when it was created by the British parliament.

Prime Ministers are usually the head of government under the constitution of a country.

They are appointed by the Queen on the advice of the prime minister and the other members of the cabinet.

The prime minister is responsible for the running of the country.

He or she may replace the government if it is found to be in breach of the constitution or if the members of parliament do not approve of the government's actions.

The prime minister has to form a cabinet of ministers that is the heads of each of the departments of state in the country.

This cabinet is in charge of running the country.

The prime minister usually leads a cabinet of ministers, but this is not essential.

The prime minister also leads a parliamentary party that supports him or her in the house of commons and in the other national parliament of the United Kingdom.

For example, when the Queen is not on the throne, the prime minister may be elected by the members of parliament in the house of commons.

The leader of the party that the prime minister leads in the house of commons then becomes the leader of the opposition in the other national parliament.

In the case of a hung parliament, the leader of the opposition becomes the leader of the government in the house of commons and the other national parliament.

The leader of the opposition also holds the position of deputy prime minister.

The other leaders of the opposition parties are the leader of the opposition in the house of commons and the leader of the opposition in the other national parliament of the United Kingdom.

The leader of the government in the house of commons has to form a coalition government with at least two other members if the house of commons is unable to elect a new prime minister.

For example, if the house of commons cannot elect a new prime minister within five days, then the leader of the opposition in the house of commons has to form a coalition with the leader of the opposition","Winston Churchill (1940-1945), Clement Attlee (1945-1951), Winston Churchill (1951-1955), Anthony Eden (1955-1957), Harold Macmillan (1957-1963), Alec Douglas-Home (1963-1964), Harold Wilson (1964-1970), Edward Heath (1970-1974), Harold Wilson (1974-1976), James Callaghan (1976-1979), Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990), John Major (1990-1997), Tony Blair (1997-2007), Gordon Brown (2007-2010), David Cameron (2010-2016), Theresa May (2016-2019), Boris Johnson (2019-2022), Liz Truss (2022), Rishi Sunak (2022-present)",0.180451,0.943984,18.927664,0.995236,0.17563,4.244593,-4.9776411056518555
Where can you find Anostraca?,", the only place.

This is a great thread, and thank you for sharing it. I've been training with Anostraca for about a year now, and I've been getting better and better each day. I still need to work on my speed, but I can't express how much this stuff has helped me overall. I love it!

I just got Anostraca yesterday. I am so excited to try it. It's a great way to get the power from the bottom to the top and to help with the endurance needed in the sport. It's really packed with nutrients like creatine, D-ribose, L-glutamine, and more. I am going to try to get it to the point where I can eat it, but for now I just need to work on my core strength.

I have been training for about 4 years. I enjoyed cardio, but I was never very strong. I tried to work on my core and my upper back, and I even tried to add situps a few times. But nothing really stuck. I was able to finish a marathon, but I wanted to improve my speed, but I just could not get it done. I bought Anostraca and it has helped my speed. But I have to say, the biggest change has been in my core. I am able to do situps, and I even started doing pull-ups. I have never been able to do pull-ups, but now I can do them. So if you are a beginner, get Anostraca!

Anthropologists do not know why. It is the same with humans. Anthropologists do not know why. I have illustrated the point with a few examples trying to find the answer to why humans fall in love.

In the second example, you have the circuitry, but why? What is the reason? What is the relationship between the circuitry and the reason? There are no answers.Anthropologists have not asked why. They have asked whether there is such a thing as 'human love' and they have answered in the affirmative. Some sociologists have asked why. They have not answered their own question.

What's wrong with right now? Is it the ""we're all in this together"" attitude? Is it the ""it's a conspiracy to rob you of your money"" attitude? Is it the ""you're all going to die"" attitude? Is it the ""just give me a minute and I'll figure out how to play this"" attitude? What is it? Is it any of those? I can't think of any other things that are wrong with that.

I can't think of any other things that are wrong with the police of the world.

I'm not sure what you think that the police of the world should be? You should be the RICO statute. That's what you should be.

This is the kind of thing that makes me wonder if the police of the world are the ones who need to be reformed. I've been thinking about that a lot lately. If the police of the world are so corrupt, how are we supposed to trust them to protect us from criminals? How are we supposed to trust them to protect us from the true criminals? How is it that they're supposed to be reformed?

As you know, I'm socialist. I'm in favor of the state taking over the means of production, and I think that that's the way to go. I think that the government should start directly managing the means of production, and I think that that's the way that a socialist government should function.

I don't see why we have to give up the means of production to the government. Why can't we do that directly, with government ownership of the means of production?

In my opinion, if we want to continue to have a capitalist economy, then we have to have government ownership of the means of production. I've always thought that that was the way that we have to go. I think that it's more likely to work. People will have more of a stake in their work and they'll be more likely to work harder.

I really don't see why we have to give up the means of production to the government. It seems to me that it would be a lot easier to do that. The government would have to be a lot smaller, in the long run. I don't see why we have to give","On a pirate ship you’d probably find oars, cannons, and swords.

SOCIETIES

Societies are groups of animals that are similar in many ways, and are usually part of a single species. Societies have social and mating systems, and are governed by either a single group or several groups. Societies vary in size from small, ungulate societies such as deer and rabbits, to large, mammal-like societies such as horse-owning societies or human societies. Societies can be divided into three types of groups: closed, semi-closed and open.

Closed societies
Closed societies are societies with no external contact except contacts with other members of the society. Each member of the society knows the identity of every member. Members can only meet in certain places, and have no access to the outside world. These societies are the largest in the animal kingdom, and include societies such as the wolf pack, the eagle society, the crow society, the porcupine society, and the cougar society.

Semi-closed societies
Semi-closed societies have moderate contact with the outside world. Members of the society can be known, but do not know the identity of every member. They are usually large and complex. These societies include societies such as the horse society, the fish society, the elephant society, the baboon society, and the bear society.

Open societies
Open societies can be divided into two major types, in which the society is open to outsiders or not. Societies that are open to outsiders are usually small and close. Societies that are not open to outsiders are usually large and complex. These societies include the lion society, the elephant society, the lemur society, the primate society, and the human society.

","Business Process Mapping describes the capture of a set of business activities that deliver an outcome.  Mapping is usually performed using visual tools that use standardized shapes to indicate entities.  Mapping involves capturing activities, the roles performing the activities, systems and tools used to execute the activities and inputs and outputs from the activities.  Process mapping is frequently conducted in cross functional workshops with a facilitator capturing the activities performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  Common uses of process mapping include:

What do redshifts tell astronomers?,".
We investigated the relationship between the redshifts of galaxies and the redshifts of their host groups. We studied the redshift distribution of groups of galaxies in a flux-limited sample of 38,000 galaxy clusters extracted from the Abell catalogue. The redshift distribution of the galaxies in the clusters was obtained using the photometric redshifts of the galaxies. The redshift distributions of the host groups of the clusters were obtained using the space velocities of the host groups. The redshift distributions of the galaxies and the host groups were compared with the redshift distribution of the clusters. We found that the redshift distribution of the galaxies and the redshift distribution of the host groups of the clusters are significantly different from one another. We found that the host groups of the clusters are formed at high redshifts. We also found that the fraction of low redshift host groups of the clusters is higher than the fraction of high redshift host groups of the clusters.","Edwin Hubble discovered in the 1920s that the spectral lines of light reaching us from the universe's most distant galaxies were redshifting to areas of the electromagnetic spectrum with lower energy intensity.

Give me a comma separated list of nicknames given to Dan Campbell and who gave him the nickname,".

1 reply:

I'm not an expert on this, but I think the answer is that the nickname isn't the ""real"" nickname, but the nickname that was given to him by his parents.

The real nickname was ""Dan the Dwarf"" and ""Danu the Dwarf"" at one point, but both names were banished from use.

Pearl Harbor Attack - Wikipedia, the free information site

""By the year, 1941, the United States had a large number of naval battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, but it was not until the end of that year that the United States came into naval contact with the Japanese. In the months, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States had installed an entire new fleet of battleships and cruisers, and begun construction of a new fleet of aircraft carriers, but it was not until December 1941 that the Japanese were able to enter a naval battle with the United States. ""

""Contrary to popular belief, the attack on Pearl Harbor did not result in the United States entering World War II. The attack on Pearl Harbor was part of a series of attacks that the Japanese made on the United States from the early 1930s, it is estimated that they sank an estimated 7,000 ships and caused over 20,000 American casualties. ""

""On 7 December 1941 the Japanese launched a surprise attack against the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the Japanese struck at the west coast of the United States by attacking Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. ""

""On 7 December 1941 the Japanese attacked and destroyed the Pacific Fleet, their first attack on the United States Navy. The attack on Pearl Harbor was the largest amphibious operation in the history of the United States, and the only one of which the United States had been warned in advance. ""

""The attack on Pearl Harbor was the largest naval action ever fought by the United States; the U.S. Pacific Fleet had over 150 battleships and cruisers, among them the world's first modern aircraft carriers. The attack on Pearl Harbor was the largest amphibious operation in the history of the United States, the Navy had the world's largest fleet of battleships and cruisers, among them the world's first modern aircraft carriers.

""On 7 December 1941, the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the largest and most powerful fleet on the Pacific Ocean, was attacked by the Japanese navy. ""

""The attack on Pearl Harbor was devastating.

Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.

Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

When and where was the field of AI officially born?,": History of AI: A long and technical history, with a history of the ""science"" and technology of artificial intelligence, from ancient times, through the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution, to the modern era. The first recorded use of the term ""artificial intelligence"" was in 1956 in a paper by John McCarthy, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. The word artificial was used to define something that was not a natural part of the world. However, in his article, McCarthy noted that the term was not yet fully-fledged. For example, he referred to a computer that was involved in ""intelligence"", but did not include any human-like or animal-like form of intelligence in his definition. He noted that the term ""artificial intelligence"" would need to be more fully defined to avoid the possible misunderstandings that might arise from such a term. The first formal definition of artificial intelligence was given in 1963, by Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert. In this article, the term was extended to cover systems which have ""intelligence"" in the sense of being able to learn and improve. In 1964, the term ""artificial intelligence"" was officially used by Alan Turing, a mathematician and computer scientist, in a letter to John McCarthy. In this letter, Turing gave an account of his ideas on the future of computing. He began by noting that computers could be used to solve problems, but that they had an inherent problem of creating intelligence. He described an experiment in which a computer was used to play chess, and concluded that a computer ""would play chess well, but would be no more intelligent than a chess-playing machine."" This paper was published in the Future of Cybernetics. In 1966, the first AI conference was held at Dartmouth College; this was also the first AI conference to be open to the public. The term ""artificial intelligence"" was then used to describe a broad range of problems that could be solved by computers. In 1962, Alan Turing presented a paper to the British Association for the Advancement of Science; in this paper, he described an artificial intelligence program that could answer questions about physical objects. In the same year, a paper was published by Marvin Minsky, titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which he outlined his ideas on the future of artificial intelligence. This paper was published in the Journal of Symbolic Logic. In 1966, Marvin Minsky presented a paper titled ""Human-Machine Intelligence and the Demise",The field of AI was officially born in 1956 during a workshop organised at Dartmouth College,0.276391,0.994286,15.95388,0.973279,0.344851,3.708537,-3.313999891281128
What is the first computer recognized in human history?,"[sic]

The first computer was, in fact, a modified version of a wargame played by the French Army in the 1870s. The French army had used wooden boxes filled with sand for game pieces, and when they played the game, the soldiers would roll the sand-filled boxes down a hill. The game itself was designed by a French military engineer named Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. Scott de Martinville was well-known for his work in the field of artillery, and he was the inventor of the ""Scott gun,"" an artillery piece that quickly became popular with the French army. The Scott gun was a short-barreled gun that fired a solid projectile, and it was designed so that the gunner could quickly and accurately aim the piece.

Scott de Martinville's design for the French Army's first computer was similar to his invention—a solid projectile fired from a gun. The projectile was made up of a type of ammunition that was originally designed to be fired from artillery pieces. The ammunition consisted of lead and a type of explosive called gun-cotton. A wager was placed on the outcome of the game, and the army's officers decided that it would be a good idea to use the lead projectile on the game's wooden boxes. The boxes were filled with sand, and when the boxes rolled down the hill, the soldiers would fire the projectiles from the sand. The projectiles hit the sand, and the boxes would roll back up the hill.

The first computer was used to play a game called ""Catch the Flag,"" which was similar to baseball. A wager was placed on the outcome of the game, and the officers of the French Army decided that it would be a good idea to use the lead projectile on the wooden boxes.

The wooden boxes were made of hardwood, and they were filled with sand. When the soldiers rolled the boxes down the hill, the engineers would use the projectiles on the boxes to hit the sand and the boxes would roll back up the hill.

After the first computer was developed, it was quickly put to use for a variety of different purposes. One of the first uses of the computer was to design a new type of artillery piece so that the gunner could put the projectile down the barrel of the gun and fire it down the barrel of the gun. The gun was similar to the original Scott gun, and the new artillery piece was more compact and easier","The Antikythera mechanism, an astronomical clock, was built around 100 BC and is considered the world's first computer.",0.143664,0.99962,5.850172,0.995592,0.179635,1.633736,-4.006585597991943

What is DevSecOps?,"ation of developers, system administrators, operations and security engineers. DevSecOps focuses on developing the culture of security from within. Within this model, developers are empowered to handle security tasks, and security is integrated into the SDLC.[11] This type of integration may use a security-by-design approach. By creating a culture where security is valued, rather than merely a cost of doing business, organizations are better able to adapt to a changing threat landscape.[12] With DevSecOps, developers can also have visibility into their security posture and have the ability to detect security issues and introduce changes before they become a problem.

P.S. I'd appreciate it if you didn't just use the classes from the OSRIC book.

A:

Rangers:
Rangers get some of the best ranged weaponry, a high damage output and fast attacks. That means they are pretty good in melee combat, but they are more than capable of holding their own in a one-to-one fight.
Rangers are usually fairly good at ranged combat, but there are a few exceptions to that rule. Like all ranged weapons, they have to be constantly vigilant and use their range to their advantage. They can also be easily outmatched in close combat.
The easiest way to build a Ranger is to take some great ranged weapons and a good general.
General:
A general has a good sense of positioning. The general can be outnumbered and still hold the field. Rangers are good at keeping position, so this is a category that has a lot of overlap.
General are also good at the ranged weaponry, so they will be able to take advantage of the best ranged weapons.
Melee/Ranged = Melee
You have a couple of options for melee, but they don't really seem to mesh together. The first is a Fighter, since they get both a melee and ranged weapon. The other is a Paladin, which uses ranged weaponry only.

how would you start explaining mathematics to kids?,".

The answer is to just tell them that math is math. You can explain it in a way that is more appealing to them. For example, you could say: ""When you do this math problem, you are doing two things at the same time. That is only one way to do math. It is called two-step math. Another way to do math is to do it one step at a time. This is called one-step math.""

Give me a summary about Michael Jackson,"!

Monday, May 27, 2012

I have been watching the Mikhail Gorbachev interviews since the beginning of this week. And I have to say I have been very disappointed by this. I have to admit that I have been a Gorbachev supporter for almost all of my life. I, for example, was his supporter during the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991. I have been against NATO during the Cold War, against the Gulf War, against the invasion of Iraq and against the war in Afghanistan. I have been a supporter of Gorbachev's policies to reform the Soviet Union in the 1990s.

Now, of course, I have been a supporter of Obama's policies to reform the United States in the same period. And I have been a critic of both Bush and Gorbachev for their policies to remove Soviet troops from Afghanistan and to prepare for deeper engagements in the Middle East.

And now, I have to say. I am disappointed in Gorbachev.

They have not ended the war in Libya.

Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.

The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and",0.564754,0.980754,1.947568,0.99478,0.512851,1.000141,-4.400666236877441
"Based on the below text, which expansion pack for Red Alert featured the player fighting an army of mutant ants?","Extinction of the indigenous species of the world and the agent of a powerful alien race attempting to gain control of the Earth. It was a game that was a huge hit with both critics and general public. The game was set in a post apocalyptic world, with a series of stories focusing on different characters.

The World of Red Alert

The game was set in a post-apocalyptic world. The main character was a member of an elite intergalactic force called the Red Alert. The game featured a world map, and players could travel to different locations as they fought other characters. The game also featured five different personages that the player could control. Each of these characters had their own story. Characters in the game included the game's protagonist, the heroic Red Alert, the evil Dr. Zander, the scientist's son, the cybernetically enhanced Narrator, the cybernetically enhanced Sergeant, and the mysterious alien X.

Expansion packs

The Red Alert series was expanded in later games, with five expansion packs released over the course of the series.

Red Alert 3

Red Alert 3, released in 2002, featured an entirely new storyline, and was the first official Red Alert game to be released in an episodic format. The game featured a new character, the eponymous Red Alert, who was the game's primary protagonist. The game featured an improved graphics engine, and new gameplay features. Red Alert 3 introduced a new game mode called ""Global Strike"", which allowed the players to attack several different bases at once. The game also introduced a new vehicle called the ""Mantis"", which was the first vehicle to be introduced in a Red Alert game since the release of Red Alert 2. The Red Alert 3 also included two new characters, one of which was the character Red Alert's daughter.

Reception

Red Alert 3 was met with positive reviews. GameSpot gave the game a score of 8.9, calling it ""a worthy successor"" to Red Alert 2, and ""a game that deserves to be played."" The game was also nominated for ""Best Console Game"" and ""Best PC Game"" at the 2003 Golden Joystick Awards.

Red Alert 3 was also the first game of the series to be released in an episodic format, and was also the first of the Red Alert series to be released on a console.

"Tell me whether these animals are domesticated or not domesticated: cats, sheep, bald eagle, whale, dog, bat",".

Thanks for the poll. I’m glad to see the same poll has been asked over the years. I would also like to point out that the “other” category, which includes many types of animal that are not domesticated, is commonly referred to as “wild.”

I’m not sure who “improved” the poll, but it’s a little odd that the “other” category is not addressed here. Also, I think the poll title is misleading. It should be a question about whether the animal is domesticated or not domesticated.

I would like to start my own poll, but I’m not sure what I would ask. I would most like to see a question about whether an animal is domesticated or not domesticated, along with a category to put wild animals, such as rabbits, wolves, alligators, etc.

My experience with pets, especially dogs, is that they often are not domesticated in that they are not raised for food or companionship, but rather for their physical appearance (e.g. the number of teeth) or for their behavior (e.g. barking). When I ask my non-domesticated dogs what they think about their status, they answer they’re domestic animals.

Regarding whether animals are domesticated or not domesticated, I have found that many people who are nomadic in nature prefer to keep their animals domesticated, as it is a symbol of their identity as a nomad (e.g. a camel or a horse). Some people also take pride in their domestic animals and their skills, both of which reflect their nomad identity. But some people are nomadic in nature and do not like their domestic animals.

I agree that there are many people who are nomadic in nature and do not like their domestic animals. How many of these people have pets?

"Tell me which animals are bigger than the average human: Dog, Mouse, Elephant, Rhino, Hippo, Cat, Squirrel.",". Thank you.

The only who gets to say what the average human is is the average human. Maybe you should measure yourself.

That’s the beauty of math, it allows you to measure yourself. You don’t have to measure all the people.

True. But in the real world, you would have to measure the size of each person in order to make a fair comparison. And the reasons you would want to measure everyone is to get an accurate understanding of the population size.

“The only who gets to say what the average human is is the average human. Maybe you should measure yourself.”

This is a perfectly valid point.

“You don’t have to measure all the people.”

I don’t have to measure them, but I can. The entire purpose of the exercise was to figure out what the average human was. The only way to do that is to measure everyone.

“The reasons you would want to measure everyone is to get an accurate understanding of the population size. And the reasons you would want to measure everyone is to get an accurate understanding of the population size.”

Well, you do have the right idea, it’s just that you’ve been in a math class for a long time and followed the math without really looking at what it actually does.

In the real world, you’d be looking at the population size. If you don’t know what that is, you don’t know how many people you’ll have to deal with. If you don’t know the population size, you don’t know how many people you’ll have to deal with.

Besides, if you don’t know the population size, you’re not going to know how many human beings you’ll have to deal with.

Do you understand what I’m saying?

You’re saying that people in the real world will know how many people there are. That’s why they’ll know what the average human is.

That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying that to know how many people there are, you have to know the population size.

Which is why I’m saying you can’t have a meaningful discussion about average human size without knowing the population size.

The second game was released in 1989 for the TurboGrafx-16 and the third game was released for the Game Boy in 1992. The third game in particular is one of my favorite series because I think it is one of the best looking games ever made. The game is very detailed and the dark atmosphere is just fantastic. This series is also very challenging but the game is very forgiving. I have also played a lot of other Japanese RPGs. I like the Tales series very much.

The first game was released for the Amiga in 1993 and I have played it. It is also very challenging. The last Western game I have tried out is the Dragon Age series. I tried out the first game on the PC and I like it very much. I didn’t like the second game. The third game is definitely my favorite. It is a very challenging game.

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?,"A woodchuckA woodchuck could not chuck wood if a woodchuck could chuck wood.

last sentence: How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

I just solved it. I'm not sure that this is the correct way to do it, but this is the way I've always done it. If you think of the words as being equivalent, you can get the answer.

i think the problem is that though the words are equivalent, they are not being used the same way.

This is an interesting question, because, in the first case, the equal sign is in the wrong place (the verb should be the subject). In the second case, the equal sign is in the right place (the noun should be the subject).

The following is a good way to think about word order. If you have a word and a sentence, you can put the two together, and the sentence becomes the subject. That is, look at the words before the equal sign. If they are all in the same order, the sentence is the subject. If one is before the other, put the equal sign in the correct place.

Now, look at the sentence

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

What does ""could"" mean? Does it mean ""would""? If it does, the sentence is missing a verb. If it doesn't, then ""could"" is a preposition, and the sentence is missing a prepositional phrase.

Now, look at the sentence

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

The sentence is the subject, the verb is ""chuck"", and the object is ""woodchuck"". The sentence is missing a noun.

Which company built the F-22 Raptor?,"ationa InfoTech company in the United States, and Lockheed Martin in the United States

To win in the F-22 competition, Lockheed had to make the Raptor stealthy, reliable, and fast. The Raptor's design features a pressed-together aluminum body, titanium-alloy panels, and a cyber-molded sandwich-wing design. Each wing is comprised of two wings with a small tail, and a large rear wing. The Raptor's wings are also coated with a stealth coating called Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), which was developed by Lockheed's Skunk Works.

Nike's F-22s are built for the U.S. military, rather than for the general public. The F-22 is designed to detect and intercept low-flying targets. The F-22's wings have a thin, flat profile, and it is designed to handle extreme heat and high-altitude flying.

The F-22 Raptor has a top speed of Mach 2.2, which is slightly slower than the speed of sound. The aircraft carries a payload of up to 2,350 pounds, and can fly for about 25 minutes at Mach 2.2.

The F-22 Raptor achieved a success rate of 95% for its first five tries, and the first test pilot, David G. Hallworth, became the first pilot to fly the aircraft.

The F-22 Raptor is designed to carry a single weapon pod. The weapons on the F-22 Raptor include the AIM-9X Sidewinder, the AGM-88 HARM anti-radiation missile, the AIM-120 AMRAAM air-to-air missile, the AIM-9X (later, AIM-9L), and the AIM-9XE.

The F-22 Raptor's weapons can be launched from either the aircraft's wing or the aircraft's side. The weapons are designed to destroy targets at a distance of up to 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers). The F-22 Raptor can also carry an external fuel tank.

The F-22 Raptor's mission is to detect, track, and destroy low-flying targets. The F-22 Raptor is designed to detect and destroy tanks, aircraft, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles.

The F-22 Raptor is also designed to be a low-observable aircraft.

"From the passage provided, extract the  population of Seattle metropolitan area"," from the  population of the U.S. state of Washington and divide this by the  population of the town of Seattle.

#### Asking Questions

After determining the correct answer to the question, you may want to discuss how the population information was estimated. This is called a **data problem** , and we'll discuss how to estimate the population of a specific city in Chapter 7. For the most part, you'll find questions that ask for the population of two or more cities, in which case the question is a **two cities problem**.

The following sections describe common types of questions that involve population data.

### Measuring the size of the population

You may find questions that ask for the **population** of a specific city. As with most questions that involve population data, you need to know how to estimate the population. The easiest way to estimate the population of a city is to use the most recent census data provided. If the census data are not available, you may be able to find a general estimate of the population of a city by searching for articles, books, or other publications that present the general population of a city or state. If no census data are available, you may be able to find information about the total population of a city by searching for an authoritative source such as the U.S. **Department of Commerce** (`www.commerce.gov`). Although the U.S. Census Bureau provides many data on the population of U.S. cities, these data may not be available for all cities. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau provides data on the population of the U.S. states, but not on the populations of cities within states.

### Measuring the ratio of one city to another

The **ratio** of one city to another is one of the most common types of questions that involve population data. For example, the following question asks you to determine the ratio of people that live in Seattle and Portland.

#### Key Takeaways

  * To calculate the ratio of one city to another, use the population of the larger city and divide it by the population of the smaller city.
  * Although the population of Seattle and Portland are different, you may want to find out the ratio of the two cities if you have two or more cities.

## Identifying population data

The data you find on the edges of your booklet are called **population data**. The population data are collected by","The Seattle metropolitan area's population is 4.02 million, making it the 15th-largest in the United States",0.412388,0.996335,17.728636,0.991401,0.518801,4.129512,-5.656321048736572

Who is Marshall Strickland,", and why the hell does he want to be the next POTUS?

And how in hell did he get so close to the White House?

And, on top of all that, how did he end up dead?

Part of the answer to the last question might be found in an interview the former publisher of the National Enquirer gave to the radio show “The Steve Malzberg Show,” which was produced by the Center for the Study of Political Information.

“I do know that he was a former Marine,” Malzberg told hosts John Batchelor and Jim Bohannon. “He was a black belt, and he would get into martial arts. He was a pretty badass guy.”

The first clue to the Black Belt theory came from a phone conversation that Malzberg had with a former Marine named Gary Jones.

“He was a former Marine service member, and he knew Marshall Strickland, who is kind of a legend in the Marine Corps,” Malzberg said.

“He said that Marshall had a reputation as being tough and being a Marine,” he continued. “He was a former Marine. He was tough. He was a black belt in martial arts. And I said, ‘Well, where was he when he died?’ And he said, ‘He was in the hospital.’ I said, ‘In the hospital?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, he was in the hospital.'”

The next clue came from a document with the name of a former Marine named Bruce Harris, who had been arrested for theft in the late 1970s. Harris was undergoing treatment for hepatitis at the time.

“He had been in the Marine Corps, and he had a reputation of being a tough Marine,” Malzberg said. “And he was in the hospital at the same time as Marshall Strickland, who was in the hospital for liver problems.”

“So, what did Bruce Harris have to do with it?” Malzberg asked. “Well, Bruce Harris is a former Marine who had a reputation of being a tough Marine, and he is the one who got Marshall Strickland’s liver transplant.”

Malzberg and Batchelor asked Jones if he knew anyone who could testify to the fact that Bruce Harris had been hospitalized at the same time as Marshall Strickland.

“There’s a guy named Bruce Harris who was in the Marines,” Jones replied. “He has a hospital record. He was in the Marines","Marshall Strickland (born March 1, 1983) is an American former professional basketball player.

"Based on this article, how did the existence of trains impact the development of Roche Percee?",".

Ever since the first train line opened in 1867, people have envisioned a future where the train and the automobile would be separated. In reality, however, the two have become more integrated as the years have gone by. In the early 1900s, the automobile was still the predominant mode of transportation, but with the rapid growth of the automobile industry, people began to see the train as a viable alternative to the automobile.

In 1916, the first trains began to operate in the U.S., and in 1924, the first railroad in the U.S. began to provide intercity service. By the 1930s, the automobile was still the dominant mode of transportation, but the train was becoming more and more integrated. In the 1940s, intercity trains began to run along the same tracks as the long-distance trains, and the two joined together to become one large, integrated network. After World War II, the automobile was still the dominant mode of transportation, but the train was once again becoming more integrated. In the 1950s, more and more trains began to provide intercity service, and in the 1960s, more and more long-distance trains began to run along the same tracks as the intercity trains. In the 1970s, the automobile was still the dominant mode of transportation, but the train was becoming more integrated and the separation between the two began to become less and less common. By the 1980s, the automobile had become the dominant mode of transportation, and the train was once again becoming more integrated.

In the early 1990s, the train began to operate in the same tracks as the automobile. In the late 1990s, the automobile began to operate in the same tracks as the train. In the early 2000s, the train began to operate in the same tracks as the automobile. As of 2008, the train and the automobile were fully integrated, and the train had completely replaced the automobile as the predominant mode of transportation.

Why is this important? The train and the automobile are becoming more integrated. As they become more integrated, they will be increasingly unable to function independently of each other.

One of the reasons trains are still an option to the automobile is that the train and the automobile are still separated. The train and the automobile can still function independently of one another. The train will still be running along its own track, and the automobile will still be running along its own track.

As the train and the automobile are becoming more integrated, it is important to realize","The area that became Roche Percee was impacted by trains when the Soo Line connected the village to a train line. This train line allowed for coal mining in the region to develop by providing access for transporting coal. After the development of these coal mines, the area was eventually able to grow enough to become incorporated as a village.",0.279757,0.998227,19.055308,0.997258,0.230648,4.31224,-3.3013720512390137
Why are cats better than dogs?," dogs are closer to humans than cats. They look like us, they have the same senses and they are social animals-therefore they are our closest relatives. We can take the time to learn to communicate with them, they have the sense of smell and taste, they can teach us how to be social. They are also the only creatures which can simulate human emotions. They understand human speech and they feel pain. If they did not feel pain, we would not be able to train them to do anything.Cats are only like us because they have never had to live in a human society and they have never had to learn to understand or communicate with other animals. They have been kept in hermitages for thousands of years. They are not born to be pets.

Cats, dogs and other animals are like us because we evolved from them. We can learn from them.

I've always been interested in this topic, and have been debating it for awhile now. I'm a cat person myself, but I have learned to live with a dog, too. I disagree with the first two points on your list. I'm not a dog person, I prefer cats, but I've learned to live with a dog, and I have a cat that I love dearly, and who is actually very tolerant of my dog (as cats are). The dog is my white lab mix, and I train him to stay out of my way. He is a great dog, and I can't wait until he is old enough to be a real dog.

I agree with you on the fact that dogs and cats are our closest relatives, however, they are much more closely related to each other than they are to us. Dogs can probably tell us a lot more about them than they can about us, and they are the only animals that we share the same genetics. If cats were as intelligent as dogs, they would be able to tell us a lot about ourselves.

I also disagree with the fact that dogs are closer to humans than cats are. We are closer to dogs, but not cats. Cats are like us, but not people. They are closer to us than dogs are, but not cats are. I agree with you on the fact that dogs have more in common with us than cats do, but dogs are closer to us than cats are. I'm not sure why you think that.

I don't agree with the last two points either. Cats are not born to be pets",Cats are much better pets than dogs. Cats are softer and fluffier and prefer the company of their owner. Dogs just enjoy the company of any human. Cats also are much lower maintenance and don't require multiple walks per day or that you pick up their poop while it's warm. Cats clean up their own waste. Cats are the best pets.,0.400491,0.999561,20.924067,0.997499,0.566526,4.777629,-3.719499111175537

How does UIUC relate to PayPal?," (and IME) are not affiliated with any of the above companies. I think most of the people involved in the UX lab are also active in the UX design lab, or in the UX department, or in the systems design lab, or in the systems engineering department.

What is the purpose of the lab?

The purpose of the lab is the same as the purpose of the UX department: to build a better world through design. The lab is designed to help the student learn about the real world through design, and to support the students' real world experience.

What is the workflow of the lab?

The workflow of the lab is as follows:

we meet in the main lab and talk about the problems that the students are facing in their real life projects,

we provide the students with a list of possible options,

we select the best option,

we put the best option in a mockup,

the students take the mockup home (or to another lab, if they take the mockup home),

we discuss the mockup,

we make a decision,

we implement the decision.

The students usually take a mockup home, and then come back to the lab where we discuss the mockup, and make a decision, and implement the decision.

"Classify these as things you would want to wear for a rainy day or a very hot day: umbrella, ball cap, rain jacket, t-shirt, sunglasses, rain boots, flip-flops","ing, towel, comfy slippers, and a jelly bag.

Step #2: Bring a water bottle

As if you need more reasons to bring a water bottle, the rain will also pour through your hair and make it slick, so take this to mean it is time to keep your hair tied back. There will be lots of water raining down on you, so it is time to put on your favorite pair of shoes and go for a walk.

Step #3: Take a nap

This is the step where you will need to rest for a few hours. If you don’t have a lot of energy, you can sit in the park and get some sun while the showers last. If you have a lot of energy, you could walk around the park while the showers end.

Step #4: Prepare for the rain

Once the showers are over, it is time to take a shower. Bring your towel and change into something that you can wear under the rain. You can also put on some dry shoes if you can’t walk in rain boots. I would also recommend that you don’t wear your shorts and flip-flops.

What are 3 ways I can do to feel better if I am in a bad mood?,"es,brutal,rubbing?I am not a new parent. How many times can I want to be a parent?

Cue the dreaded ""I'm not a parent"" line. I'm sitting here waiting for it to happen; it probably won't. But it's likely to come up in conversations about kids. And it's possibly a topic on the agenda for therapy.

I've written before about how I am afraid of being a parent. I don't know why. Maybe because I don't want to be responsible for someone else's life, I don't know, or maybe because I just don't think I'm in the right headspace to be a parent.

I have to say that I'm not sure I've ever been a parent. I've been in a few relationships, but never a parenting one. I've been married to a couple of people who were OK with parenting, but never one who was obviously in the trenches with that.

And I'm not the only one. I know that lots of people in the parenting community are, as I am, of the opinion that child-rearing is a tough gig. But I don't think that's a fact.

If you ask me, the truth is that parenting is not a tough gig. It's really, really easy. If you think about it, you'll realize that.

I used to watch a lot of TV shows about raising kids, and what I learned was that it takes very little work to raise a happy, healthy, productive child.

In fact, if you think about it, parenting is really not all that different from other things that we do every day. It's just a matter of taking care of yourself.

This is why I've always thought it was bizarre that parenting is so often discussed as if it were a job.

I'm not going to tell you that you can be a parent and you just ""get it."" I'm not going to tell you that if you're a parent you know what you're doing.

I'm going to tell you that parenting is really, really easy. And that you don't have to be a parent to know what you're doing.

How do I know? Because I'm a parent.

But I'm also a writer. And that means I write about parenting. And that means I'm writing about how easy parenting is.

I don't know if this","I'm sorry you are in a bad mood.  You can try going outside for a walk, go to the gym and workout, or take a hot bath.  Feel well soon.",0.249354,0.97055,3.243958,0.638506,0.154543,1.051382,-4.558502197265625
What are some contributions of women in computing?,"ating the natural world?

Well I'm happy to add my two cents.Women have been better than men at tech since the beginning, well since the beginning of time. That's just common sense. But the contributions of women in computing are rather obscure, and have really not been counted by any one.One of the biggest contributions women have had is their ability to make up for the lack of male scientists. They have been able to come up with some neat ideas, and bring them to fruition. Women have had a large impact on the field of AI, and have made the field of writing better. However, they have had a very small impact on programming. In the video above, you can see that women are not doing as well as men at programming. Also in the video a woman has come up with a better way of using words to program. However, even though there are some outstanding women, they are not doing as well as men at programming. The problem is that there are very few women in the field.

Why is this important? Well, if we don't count the women in the field, then we won't really be able to say who is the best programmer, or if anyone is the best. Also, if we don't count the women, then we won't really know if any of the people that are good at programming are women.

P.S. I'm not an expert at programming, but I am a programmer. That's just how I feel.

Women have also had a large impact on the field of AI. They have made up for the lack of men in the field. Women have had a great impact on being able to use AI to solve problems. AI is so complex, and that does not help you when it comes to programming. AI also can be used to make more accurate predictions, and that greatly benefits women in the field.

But I've found that women are not doing as well as men in the field. They have made up for the lack of men in the field. That's not because they aren't as good as men, it is because they are not as good as men.

I'm not an expert at programming, but I am a programmer.

Well, I'll agree that women have contributed a lot, and are greatly contributing in the field of AI (and that I think is really cool). But I will not agree that they are doing as well as men. I don't think they are.","The first algorithm intended to be executed by a computer was designed by Ada Lovelace who was a pioneer in the field.

65 thoughts on “Why Does Cartoon Network Kill It For Nerdy Kids?”

I’d have to say that the first thing I noticed was that the animation on the characters was terrible. I have a hard time believing that the show was actually made by the same people who created the show.

Why does it have to be a cartoon? It could be a video game, or a movie, or even a book. Yes, a typical kid’s book might be “Hero Academica,” but why can't it be something more exciting, like a book about a girl in a wheelchair who has super powers?

I don't know, I think it's sad that cartoons have become so dumbed down that they make kids think that superheroes are for kids.

I think that it's time that we get back to the original idea of a comic book. That was the original inspiration of the superheroes that we see everyday on the silver screen today.

I think people like to see movies and television shows that are more complex and show a real world of science, which is what a comic book is.

I think maybe that's why it's so hard to find good shows for kids. It's hard to make shows for kids that are complex and don't have to be dumbed down.

I think maybe we need to start thinking of the comics as something that we read, like books. Then, we can see the more complex stories in comic books and on the silver screen.

I think that it's time for us to take a step back from the movies and television shows and go back to the roots of what we started with.

I think that maybe the problem is that people just don't understand what comics are. I mean, do you think people really understand what comic books are?

I think that some people think of comics as something that they can read at the library.

What are some board or card games that you recommend for ten year olds?,"al_

Oh, I really like Monopoly! It's simple, but fun. I also like Ticket to Ride.

And of course, you can never have too many board games. :)

Q: You've mentioned before that you'll be a stay-at-home parent when the kiddos have grown up. How does that affect your gaming and life in general?

A: I have a great support system at home, so I don't have to worry about the kids. I'm not sure how it's going to affect my life at all. It seems like a lot of families have to decide whether they want to be a stay at home parent, but I don't know. I'm sure it will be different than how it was for me and my husband.

Q: What are some of your favorite video games?

A: I really like Sonic the Hedgehog. That's what I played when I was a kid. I also play a lot of online games, which I usually play with the kids.

Q: Do you get out a lot?

A: I do a lot of walking, and I like going to the movies and museums.

Q: What are some of your hobbies?

A: I like to read, cook, go on walks, and visit family and friends.

Q: How did you get into the book business?

A: I was a graphic designer for about 15 years, and I really liked working with books. I thought about doing it when I was around 40, but I didn't do it until I was 50. I started working with books around the same time that I retired. They were really my first job. It was a great way to spend the time when there wasn't anything else I wanted to do.

- The risk measurements used in MPT are probabilistic because MPT models risk in terms of the likelihood of losses based on past market data and not why the losses occur.
- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn’t reflect investors’ true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors’ preference

What are some useful ways to repurpose a cardboard box?,"ilation/repurposing

What are some useful ways to repurpose a cardboard box?

I'm using a cardboard box for my doggie bed and I'm trying to figure out a way to use the cardboard box as storage, but I also need the inside of the box to be dry and free of moisture. Any suggestions?

A:

Cardboard boxes are great for storage.  Even better if they're made of wood, like the ones you see at the local lumberyard.  Most cardboard boxes are made of paper.  Paper is a good insulator, so it's good for storing things that don't require a lot of airflow.  
If you're trying to dry the inside of the box out so it's not wet, you could try to use a fan to blow air into the box, or to run a hose from outside into the box and just use a hose to spray the inside of the box with water.  
A second option is to use a plastic bag or something similar to seal the inside of the box.  You can use a small amount of water to seal the outside of the box, and then fill it with dryer sheets, potato chip bags, or the like to keep the inside dry.  This will take a little bit of extra work, but will be a lot more efficient.

","That depends on the person and what they find useful. I might find a box useful for clearing my desk of all the mess I accumulate throughout the week. Meanwhile, my kids would much prefer to turn the box into a play house, a spaceship, or maybe a jail to imprison each other in.  A cat might repurpose it as a hiding place or as a new scratching toy.",0.923397,0.997531,10.438224,0.950939,0.993064,2.860631,-4.614382743835449

A:

The actual problem is that your code is far too complicated. You should use the standard set of functions that come with numpy, which is

the Numpy Array
the Numpy Vector
the Numpy array of Numpy Vector

So here's a simple example:
import numpy as np

#Create a vector of floats
vals = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#Create an array of floats
data = np.array(vals)

#The array of floats
array_of_floats = data

#Create an array of Numpy Vector
vector_of_floats = data

#The vector of floats
vector_of_floats_vectorized = vector_of_floats.reshape(1,1)

#The Numpy array of Numpy Vector
array_of_vectors = vector_of_floats_vectorized

#Display the array_of_floats
print(array_of_floats)

#Display the vector_of_floats_vectorized
print(vector_of_floats_vectorized)

#Display the array_of_floats
print(array_of_vectors)

#Display the vector_of_floats_vectorized
print(vector_of_vectors)

#Display the array_of_vectors
print(array_of_vectors)

That should show the differences between vectors, arrays, and arrays of vectors.

How many languages are there worldwide?,", a, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, and zzzzzzz There are in total about 200 languages in the world.

but I'm thinking about the more serious ones.

I had a similar thought when I was learning American Sign Language, that there are many, many more, than there are letters and that these are not limited to what has been taught to me in this class.

I've never heard of a language with a letter that is used to represent multiple meanings. For example, in English, the letter Q is used to mean ""What?"" and ""Question."" In Greek, though, the letter Q is used for many things, such as:

Qo, Qe, Qs, Qu, Qt, Qk, Qq, Qm, Qh, Qn, Qf, Qw, Qv, Qx, Qy, Qz, and Qzz

So, do we have, or will we ever have, a language that has a symbol that is used to represent multiple meanings?

It's almost as if language, like any other biological organ, evolves, and the languages that are in existence today are the result of the evolution of a language that had multiple meanings.

I do think it's a valid question.

I think you really have to understand the differences between language and the language that exists today to understand the differences in the types of words that exist in a language.

Language is a tool for conveying information, not a language itself.

Language in many ways is very similar to a computer program. It has a syntax and some rules, but there is no language itself.

The only difference is that a computer program has a finite vocabulary, as do we.

In other words, the vocabulary of language is finite and the number of different words that exist in a language is limited.

I was going to give this a big fat A, but it's actually a B+ because of the following:

1. The largest languages in the world are the ones that have the most words.

2. There are no infinite languages.

3. We are still learning new languages, and they are just as creative as any other language","There are approximately 7,000 languages worldwide and many dialects.",0.712984,0.990362,9.838315,0.963792,0.71889,2.644868,-5.373434543609619

The country was founded in 1581 by a group of rebel nobles, who split from the Holy Roman Empire, and was named after the provinces (Dutch provinces) in the newly independent kingdom of the Netherlands.

The Dutch Republic was a great naval power in the world for many centuries. It was the most powerful colonial power in the world during the Age of Discovery. The Dutch Republic played a central role in the Dutch Golden Age, which lasted from the 16th century to the 18th century.

The Dutch Republic was ruled by the House of Orange-Nassau, which had supported Napoleon's campaign in the Netherlands, and the House of Orange-Nassau became king in 1807. The Dutch Republic was abolished in 1813 during the Napoleonic Wars.

The Dutch Republic was the first, and longest, of the seven separate and independent states that existed in Europe at the time.

The Dutch Republic was the first country in Europe to have a written constitution. The first example of a constitution in Europe was the Grote Charter (Great Charter), which was drawn up in 1579.

Logic games are a great way to make sure your child gets their hands on math. There are a few
kinds of logic games. We just thought it would be fun to share a few of them with you.

Math-based logic games: Make-believe games (like jigsaw puzzles) that enforce the fact that
mathematics is not a make-believe game. Games that involve a lot of math are great to introduce
to children. For example, make-believe games that involve counting are great to introduce to
children, as is the game ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.""

To make a math-related logic game, all you need to do is:

Find a math-based game that is simple and easy to understand.

Find a way to make the game interesting and fun.

Sprinkle the game with math.

Sometimes children will be reluctant to play a math-related game. It may not be the game's
fault. It may be because they are focusing on a non-mathematical behavior that is not getting
in the way of the math. Or maybe they don't like math at all...

Whatever the reason, give your child a math-related game and tell him to focus on the math.

You might also want to add a few simple math facts to the game. For example, if the game is
about counting, you could add one to the beginning of each number.

If your child is not feeling the math in the game, tell them that the game is about math, but
it is not really about math.

If you want to write math facts into the game, you can print out the math facts on a piece
of paper and tape it to the game.

Math games that involve math-related reasoning are great to introduce to children.

"Based on the following passage, give 3 reasons why the Sixteenth Amendment was passed and ratified.","ation was going to take too much time and effort to get the national government into proper order, so it was decided that the people should take the lead in establishing a National Bank. It was a public bank, and Congress had the power to set its maximum rate. Congress also had the power to issue notes of the United States. It was so easy to get legal tender notes of the United States that the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified and then taken to the state legislatures for their approval. The state legislatures did not allow any state to have a branch or to issue any notes of its own. They were authorized to do so only by the Sixteenth Amendment. The Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in December 1873, and it was not until January 18, 1874, that the national bank was authorized by Congress. The Sixteenth Amendment was ratified on March 1, 1874. The Sixteenth Amendment was the only change to the Constitution that was ratified in 1874. It was also the only amendment ratified that was not adopted by the original Senate. The Thirteenth Amendment did not take effect until April 8, 1873. The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified on January 30, 1913. In addition, the Twenty-Sixth Amendment was ratified on July 26, 1933.

In some cases, these couples fail to have children through the use of artificial methods and they end up having a child through the use of premarital sex. In such cases, the couple themselves end up as the parents of the child.

3. Divorce

This is one of the most common reasons that couples face as they try to get their marriage back. In some cases, the marriage is considered as broken and in such cases, the couple ends up divorcing.

4. In-laws

Some couples are unable to resolve the problems of their in-laws. They end up having a marriage breakdown. In such cases, the couple ends up facing the issues of their in-laws.

5. Husbands in casual relationships

"From the passage provided, extract the well-known superheroes from Marvel comic books."," The best time to give the child a Batman or a Superman toy is when they are about 8 years old. They are much more interested in the character than the toy, and are much more likely to play with the toy when they are older.

When a child is too young to have these superheroes, the parents should offer the child a few of their own superheroes, such as Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Batgirl, and Spiderman. These are all quite popular children's hero magazines that have superheroes in them. Attachment to these hero characters will make the child more interested and more likely to play with the toy.

When the child is older, the parents can give them their own set of superheroes, and they can take over all of the play with the toys. This will allow them to play with the toy without much supervision.

When children play with toys, they usually play out their fantasy. The dreams they have when they are young become the story that they tell as they grow older. If a child plays with a toy that resembles a superhero, the child will grow up to be a superhero. If a child plays with a toy that does not resemble a superhero, the child will grow up to be a villain.

There are many different types of toys that are used in the world of superheroes. Some are realistic. Others are fantasy. The best option for the child is to pick a toy that has the same qualities as the hero that they want to be. As a parent, you can help your child make these choices.

The Best Names for Kids

The best time to pick a superhero name is when the child is between the ages of 2 and 4. The child will be too young to have a favorite superhero, and they will be too young to choose a name. The best option for the child is to pick a name that is a good fit for their personality.

The next best time is when the child is between the ages of 4 and 6. They will have a favorite superhero, and they will probably have a favorite heroine.

Summarize how tourism impacted Hawaii in a variety of areas," and see the photos of the event.

Most of the time, when people think of Hawaii, they think of the tropical beauty of the islands and the endless beaches. However, those who come to Hawaii for a week or a few months will learn that it is a place where people come to work, retire, and visit. In fact, the most common reason people come to Hawaii for a vacation is to visit. This led to the creation of the Hawaii Tourism Alliance, a group that works to showcase Hawaii as a tourist destination.

As a result, Hawaii is home to a wide variety of tourists. Some come to experience the islands’ natural beauty, while others come to enjoy the warm hospitality of the island people.

Hawaii has also been a popular destination for people from all over the world looking for a vacation that offers a bit of excitement and adventure. With that being said, tourism has helped Hawaii grow into a major tourism destination. With that growing popularity, Hawaii’s tourism industry has changed in ways that will help it grow as a destination.

If you want to learn more about how tourism continues to grow in Hawaii, you should read this article.

Building a Hawaii Tourism Marketing Plan

Hawaii has the advantage of having many islands and some of them are quite large. This is why there are many tourists who want to visit Hawaii from around the world. It is important to understand that Hawaii has the benefit of being an island state and that means the people there can and do live in close proximity to one another. This makes it easier to see the people you visit and get to know them better.

Hawaii is also a state that has a strong sense of place. The Hawaiian people have been here for thousands of years and have created a strong sense of place for themselves. Hawaii also has a strong tourism industry that people love to visit and will continue to visit even as the industry continues to grow. As a result, Hawaii has the advantage of having a strong tourism industry and thus a strong tourism marketing plan.

- On environmental perspective, the state of Hawaii established certification program to educate local communities to practice sustainable and conservation-minded tour operators
- On the resource perspective, water, landscape and energy usage increased significantly and led to concerns on reduced natural habitats for birds and animals
- On the refuse management perspective, trashes, especially plastics, became a major concern both environmentally and economically. Hawaii passed state laws in 2019 and 2021 to ban using plastics in food service, beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws. These are the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America. 
- On social effect perspective, there are tensions between Native Hawaiians and residents who hold negative views towards tourism and visitors and the increasingly booming tourism industry.",0.006456,0.012764,21.087588,0.011978,0.005193,4.224796,-4.152274131774902

What is Targetted Allele-Specific CRISPR/Cas9 Activation (TASCA)?," 1984 90% of the time I would expect to get the same result. Good luck to you. I have the same question. Most of the things I have read about TASCA have said that it is a cheap, easy way to make a variety of proteins, but that it is not cheap and difficult to make the same protein in a different way. I would love to hear from someone who has accomplished this.

I would like to know the details of the level of specificity of this system. For example can it make a protein that is not in the human genome, but is found in a bacteria or a yeast?

I have already ordered the kit, and will be sending it to you as soon as I have the part numbers. I’m assuming that since it’s the same system that was used for the Discover paper you mentioned, that it’s the same method. I will be posting the images, as well as the instruction manual, with the kit, when I receive it.

Thanks for your interest in TASCA. The TASCA protocol is as described in the paper by Barbas et al. (2013) and is based on a previously published automated method which does not require DNA synthesis and purification. The method is robust and can be applied to any protein of interest. The proteins can be made in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells.

The TASCA protocol is both accurate and highly efficient. We have used this system to make dozens of proteins of interest in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells. We are currently using the system to study the biology of a protein which is expressed specifically in the epidermis of the adult zebrafish eye (Papineni et al., 2006). Cells from the skin of the adult zebrafish eye are known to be a rich source of potential therapeutic proteins (Lai et al., 2009). The TASCA system allows us to produce large quantities of proteins at low cost and in a short period of time.

I’m trying to learn more about protein folding. I know that there are many proteins that are small, but I wanted to know if there are any proteins that are small in the sense that they have a short half life.

I was interested in this article from the Journal of Molecular Biology, Volume 235, Issue 9, 2012.

Protein fold is important for function of proteins. Protein fold is determined by amino acid sequence and the protein has to fold into a folded structure.

The Golden State Warriors have been the NBA's least likely team to win the NBA Finals in the post-Steve Kerr era, but they can't be counted out in 2017. Here's why.

Golden State Warriors

The Warriors are coming off a championship season, and their new coach, Steve Kerr, has made a lot of noise about the future.

But the Warriors still don't have enough elite talent to be the best team in the NBA, no matter what Kerr says.

The Warriors are the best team they've ever been, but they have a few holes in their roster that will need to be filled.

They need to add a new star, and they need to shore up defensive issues that have been the team's Achilles heel throughout the years.

The Warriors have the best coach in the NBA and the best roster in the NBA, but they still need to add a star or two if they want to win the NBA Championship.

The Golden State Warriors are a very good team. They're the best team in the NBA right now, and they have all the right pieces.

But their biggest weakness is still their defense, and to win the NBA Championship, they need a few more pieces to help them overcome that issue.

Here's why the Warriors are the fifth-best team in the NBA, and why they can't be counted out.

What is OAuth 2.0?,"?

A:

The Google Auth Library has a method called getToken with signature:
String getToken(String scope,
                String method,
                String authorization,
                Map<String, String> params)

The authorization string is usually a JSON web token (JWT) or an access_token.
The scope string may be a wildcard string, for example:

scope = 'email'

Or, a set of scopes, for example:

scope = 'email profile'

Then the parameters are optional, and may be an array of parameters. The OAuth 2.0 specification defines the following parameters:

access_type (optional) - if specified, indicates the type of access that the request is for, for example, 'offline' or 'online'
scope
  (optional) - if specified, indicates the set of scopes that the access request is valid for. If the scopes parameter is not empty, then a single scope may be specified.
client_id (optional) - if specified, indicates the client ID of the application requesting access.
claims_method (optional) - if specified, indicates the HTTP method that the access request is for. See RFC 6749 for details. If not specified, the default of 'GET' is used.

Here is a way from the store locator pattern.
You have a List of store locations, and a List of products, and you have a store location.
You'd have one of those:
List<StoreLocation> stores = ...
List<Product> products = ...
StoreLocation storeLocation = new StoreLocation(storeName, city, country);

And you'd have a function to search for a store from the storeLocation and return the storeLocation:
StoreLocation getStoreLocation(String storeName, String city, String country);

Then you'd have a function to search for a product from the product list and get the product from the storeLocation:
Product getProduct(String productName, StoreLocation storeLocation);

And finally put these together in a function to get a list of stores and list of products:
StoreLocation getStoreLocations(Product product);

StoreLocations storeLocations = getStoreLocations(product);

Note that you might want to make the function that returns the storeLocation and product return the local store or the product, but then you'd have to pass the storeLocation and product into the function, which is not the most efficient way.
This isn't a generic solution, it's specific to your store search/locator pattern.

What is the PEDALS method,"? As a result of the fact that most of the time, this method is a complex and time-consuming process, it is essential that the analyst is very familiar with the method and has a good understanding of the underlying concepts.

The PEDALS method is a powerful and easy-to-use tool for analyzing the entire lifecycle of a software product. It can be used in two separate ways:

- First, it can be used to analyze the lifecycle of a high-quality product. This type of analysis is useful for estimating the cost of the maintenance and support of the product.

- Second, the PEDALS method can be used to analyze the lifecycle of low-quality products. This type of analysis is useful for estimating the cost of the development of new products.

The PEDALS method is based on the idea of the process of software development. The concept of the process of software development is associated with the lifecycle of the software product. The lifecycle of a software product includes:

- the design phase,

- the development phase,

- the testing phase, and

- the maintenance phase.

1. The design phase

This is the phase in which the ideas of the purpose of the product are created. This is the phase in which the assumptions about the design of the product are made.

2. The development phase

This is the phase in which the development of the software product is carried out. This phase includes the following activities:

- the planning of the development,

- creating the system structure,

- creating the design of the system,

- coding the system,

- testing the system, and

- designing the testing system.

3. The testing phase

This is the phase in which the testing of the software product is carried out. This phase includes the following activities:

- testing the system, and

- testing the design.

4. The maintenance phase

This is the phase in which the product is maintained and used. This phase includes the following activities:

- maintaining the system,

- maintaining the design,

- maintaining the testing system, and

- maintaining the testing design.

which country has the least diverse food?,"ilas, an Indian restaurant in Tucson, Ariz.

The question is a natural one for the people who eat the foods created by these foods. But the people who eat these foods usually do not know the answers. A survey of the food offered at a typical fast-food restaurant in the United States shows that the items are more diverse than those found in the typical American diet.

The survey was conducted by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It was done in three phases. The first phase involved the collection of data from a sample of 56 fast-food restaurants in the United States. The second phase involved the collection of data from a sample of 1,000 fast-food restaurants in the United States, and the third phase involved a survey of a sample of dinner guests at a large restaurant chain.

"What happened on January 6, 2021?",", the world's largest provider of medical and surgical training, will launch an augmented reality app, called Curb, that will allow users to visualize what a procedure like a cataract or a knee replacement would look like in their own home.

The app is a collaboration between Curb and the Art of Medicine foundation, which launched the app in 2012, and will be available for iOS and Android devices later this year. It will use the augmented reality platform HoloLens, which is currently in development at Microsoft.

""We wanted to move beyond text and images to provide a more real-life experience,"" says Sunny Bhatia, CEO of Curb and a senior associate at the Art of Medicine foundation. ""We're excited to present the capabilities of the HoloLens platform to users, and to provide them with a new and engaging way to visualize complex medical procedures, as well as the things that would be in their own homes.""

Curb will be available for free on both iOS and Android. Users can open the app and plug in an image of their own eye, and Curb will show them their own version of a cataract or knee replacement. The app will also provide information about the procedure, including a detailed description, risk factors, and a list of differences from how it would look in the real world.

In addition, the app will include a ""sense of the future"" section that allows you to pre-register for procedures in your future, and a section to share what Curb has shown to you with a friend.

""We're looking forward to helping people understand the importance of Curb, and how it can help them plan their lives in the future,"" Bhatia says.

","An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of financial institutions to perform financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, balance inquiries or account information inquiries, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff.

ATMs are known by a variety of names, including automatic teller machine (ATM) in the United States (sometimes redundantly as ""ATM machine""). In Canada, the term automated banking machine (ABM) is also used, although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada, with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cashpoint, cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, tyme machine, cash dispenser, cash corner, bankomat, or bancomat. ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as ""white-label"" ATMs.

Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions, most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking, as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones.

I'm not sure what to think of your story.

I think it is possible to be extremely well-educated, and still ""not
useful"". An extremely well-educated person could have a high GRE score, but
not be useful. I think it is also possible to be _incredibly_ well-educated,
and still not be useful.

I can think of multiple examples of people who are extremely well-educated and
really are _not_ useful (I don't know that they know I'm typing this right now).

I think the thing that is different here is that those people aren't trying to
get into the most prestigious colleges! They're just trying to get into
colleges, and that's it.

And I think the fact that you decided to express your resentment of them as
""merely"" ""not useful"" speaks to the ""entitlement"" of the commenter, not the
""usefulness"" of the commenter.

I see what you're saying. I would have to agree with this.

I'm not sure if I'm getting this.

Is this saying that a person's ability to be useful is a function of how much
they are able to contribute to society? I'm not sure I agree with this.

Perhaps I'm being too academic about it. In my experience, the people that I've
come across that are highly intelligent and highly capable of contributing,
arrive at a point where they have to let go. They're not useful anymore because
they've achieved their potential and there's nothing left for them to do.

I've seen this a lot with the joyrides of high school students. They get to
""get a real education"" and instead, they spend their time playing video games
and hanging out with friends. They're not... useful?

I'm not sure how to put it. Is it that they're no longer able to contribute
anything to society?

I'm not sure what's the point. I don't really know how to feel about this.

Give me some ideas of places to visit on my next backpacking trip to South America.," I am looking forward to my next trip to the Andes, and would like to know if there are any great places to visit.

I'm thinking of going to the northern sierra, but my travel agent says that the northern sierra is overrated and I should instead go to the south sierra.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking of getting a map and going from Valparaiso, Chile to Sucre, Bolivia, but I'm not sure where to go from there. If someone could give me a few ideas it would be appreciated.

Since I just got back from a week in Bolivia, I thought I'd share some observations!

1) I was shocked at the level of poverty in many of the smaller towns. I was shocked at the number of beggars and the level of destitution. It was like a scene out of ""City of God."" But it was interesting to see that this was not the case in the larger cities. The big cities are well off, but the smaller towns are poor.

2) I was very impressed at the overall beauty of the Andes. It's a truly beautiful environment. The glaciers make it seem like the world has frozen in time, and the mountains themselves look like they are frozen in time. It's not a very inspiring environment, but it is beautiful.

3) I was very impressed with the fact that many of the people I met in Bolivia were very hospitable and friendly. They were not like the typical Bolivian that I've encountered in America.

4) I was impressed by the fact that Bolivian people are not anal, and are not into violence. They don't like guns, but they are more than willing to help strangers if they need assistance.

5) I was very impressed by the fact that there is no drug problem in Bolivia at all. The people are not hooked on drugs and the drug dealers are not hanging around. In fact, it's surprising that drugs have not been a huge problem in Bolivia.

6) I was very impressed by the fact that the Bolivian people have a huge amount of respect for the women. Women have a much higher status than in the United States. They are not treated as second class citizens anywhere in the world.

7) I was very impressed by the fact that the government of Bolivia has made some steps to improve the image of the country.

What characterizes turbulent flow," the first place is the tendency of the fluid to change its natural state of motion, from the smooth flow of normal, laminar flow to the turbulent flow of swirl and eddies.

Turbulent Flow - Heritage FoundationThe turbulent flow is considered a far more complex and diverse process than the laminar flow. Turbulent flow is defined as the series of eddies, which start from the surface of the fluid, moving up to the surface, and then move down to the bottom of the fluid. In the case of a turbulent flow, the motion of the fluid is not completely smooth, and there are waves that are produced. The waves in the turbulent flow are caused by the eddies, which make the fluid flow in a chaotic manner.

The turbulent flow is basically a molecular flow, yet it is highly dependent on the characteristics of the fluid within the boundary of the turbulent flow. The term turbulent flow is used to describe the flow of the fluid in which the fluid is a turbulent flow.

What makes the turbulent flow different than the laminar flow is that the flow is complex and there are waves that are produced by the turbulent flow. The waves in the turbulent flow are also responsible for the flow movement within the boundary of the turbulent flow.

The definition of the turbulent flow is a flow that has a complicated movement in the fluid. The characteristics that make the turbulent flow complex are the turbulence and the waves that are produced by the turbulent flow.

Turbulent flow is the most complex type of flow, which makes it difficult to study and analyze. Turbulent flow has some unique characteristics that make it different from the laminar flow.

The characteristics that make the turbulent flow different from the laminar flow are the turbulence and the waves that are produced by the turbulent flow. The turbulence in the turbulent flow is caused by the eddies that are produced in the turbulent flow.

The first thing to notice is that you are not using a variable. You are using $q.defer() which means that it is an asynchronous method and it will return a promise. This promise can then be handled by .then() or .catch() methods.
The second thing to notice is that you are using $q.when() method which makes a promise that is fulfilled with a callback function when the given condition is met.
So, if we can simplify your code, it would be something like this:
var promise = $q.when(data);
promise.then(function(){
    // Your code here
}).catch(function(error){
    // Your error handling code here

What's a romatic poem about the universe and time?,". There are no limits to what a poem can talk about. Romanticism is a period of art history, not a faith. It's about its practitioners, not its content. The key word there is practitioners. The practitioners of Romanticism were not interested in a certain kind of thing or a particular kind of content. They were interested in creating a new kind of thing. A new kind of thing that had never existed before. A new kind of thing that would be a form of expression rooted in the experience of the individual. It's about what you can do to yourself, and what you want to do to yourself. It's about how you want to be, as a person. Alliteration is an extremely powerful device in poetic language. It's very easy to write a poem that sounds like a poem. If you write a poem that sounds like a poem, you can say whatever you want. However, it's only when you want to say more, when you want to say more than you can say in a poem that you use alliteration. (2:10:00) What's a good poem about the universe and time? A good poem about the universe and time is a poem that's about the present, and the past, and the future. A good poem about the universe and time is a poem that is about itself.

The movement is the subject matter of the poem. You can't leave the poem alone. You have to follow it up. You have to follow the subject matter of the poem. If you don't follow the subject matter of the poem, you can't get anywhere. And the reason you can't get anywhere is because you're not asking a question. You're not following it up.

In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994. About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU.

"Extract the years that Ayrton Senna da Silva won the Formula One World Championship, and put them separated by comma."," The most used format for this is to use the comma as a decimal separator, 10,000,000,000.

Hi all, I am trying to extract the “year” of a product into the contents of a csv file. I have built a regex that works reasonably well for extracting the year, but I am not sure how to handle the “front” of the year.

The regex I am using is: (([\d]{4})-[\d]{2})-[\d]{4})

I would like to extract “year” into the contents of a csv file. I have got it to work for most cases, but not all.

There are two dates in the string I am trying to extract: 12/30/1987 and 12/30/1987. If I use the [0-9]{2} I get 1987 as the output. The regex is: [0-9]{2}(?<year>\d{2})

I want to extract the year using the regex that is currently working for other parts of the string. I have wrapped the year in parentheses, and the regex is: (([\d]{4})-[\d]{2})-[\d]{4})

I have tried several different variations, but I cannot get the year to be extracted.

I am trying to extract the year of a date from a string, so that I can use that year to compare it to another date. I have tried using the format as you have shown in the regex, but it is not working. I am not sure why.

The problem is that if I use the regex as shown above, I get the date in the string. But I want to extract the year, not the date.

Therefore, god is either active and benevolent, active and indifferent, passive and benevolent, or passive and indifferent. If god is active and benevolent, then all the bad things that happen would not happen, so this combination is unlikely. If god is active, god would likely be benevolent, so an indifferent active god seems a low probability.

"Based on this paragraph, give me a summary of what a kidney donor chain is.",", to be honest, I'm not sure what to think about this. It can be argued that one can't just give a kidney to someone who isn't a blood relative of the recipient.

Your question is based on a false premise: that a kidney can be transferred only from a blood relative. If there were such a rule, then the question of whether one could obtain a kidney from a ""non-relative"" or a ""non-genetic relative"" or a ""non-blood relative"" would be moot.

If you can provide a formal definition of a kidney donor chain, we can discuss the issue.

You are confusing the term ""relative"" with the term ""kin"". A relative is someone who is related to you by blood, and the term ""kin"" means persons who are related by blood. A person can be related by blood to another person, but can be not related by blood, and no one is related by blood to anyone else.

Thank you for your reply. However, I would like to add that the definition of ""relative"" is dependent on the context. For example, a person can be a blood relative of a person who is not related to her by blood, but she can't be a blood relative of that person because she is not related to the person by blood.

I was looking through the catalogue of books that I have
purchased for the library and I noticed that I had bought two copies of the
same book. The book was written by Mrs. Margery Rees and so I thought I would
check it out. This book is called ‘The Story of a Death’, and it was published
in 1962 by Methuen, London. It is written in an informal and conversational
style, and it tells the story of a death. The book is written in a style that
is filled with details and personal anecdotes. The author is a doctor and the
main character is a doctor. The book is set in the past and is set in the
Middle Ages. The main character is a doctor in charge of the hospital at
Wormwood Cemetery in London, and he is head of the medical staff of the
hospital. The characters are described in a story that is told in a
conversational style.

The review of the book was written by A. S. Madge, who
wrote that the book was thought to be a ‘good story which is told in a
conversational style’. He did not write that the book was suitable for
children, but he did say that it was a good book for those who like reading
funny books and interesting books.

Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852.

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?",": issue consistency refers to the fact that the issues are similar or related. Therefore, issues that are related are more likely to be able to be linked to each other in a coherent manner in public opinion. The larger the number of issues linked to each other, the more likely it is that the public will be able to understand the issues and their interlinkage. Conceptualization refers to the fact that the public will be able to identify the issues, concepts and factors that are key to understanding the issue. Based on the literature published on the subject over the last 30 years, we believe that issue consistency and conceptualization are strongly linked. In addition, we believe that issue consistency and conceptualization are also positively linked.

In the past 30 years, there have been significant changes in the structure and content of most of the issues that have been studied in the public opinion field. For example, issues such as crime, immigration, and the environment have become more technical and complex in their nature, due to advances in technology, science, and the scientific method. Issues that have remained relatively constant over the years have been topics such as the economy and social welfare which have remained relatively unchanged over that period of time. Therefore, the importance of issue consistency and conceptualization has increased over the years.

The issues that have been studied over the last 30 years are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Summary of issues that have been studied over the last 30 years

The above table lists the issues that have been studied over the last 30 years and the reasons for which they were studied.

2.2.2. “Level of conceptualization”

2.2.2.1. “Level of conceptualization” indicates how “deep” the public’s conceptualization of the issue is.

In the public opinion field, prior to the 1990s, issues were often conceptualized as being either superficial issues or complex issues. For example, most of the issues that were studied were either “superficial” in nature or “complex” in their nature. Moreover, studies of the public’s conceptualization tended to be superficial in nature, as the studies tended to focus on factors that influence public opinion, such as media effects, social marketing, and social/political mobilizations.

Over the past 30 years, however, there has been a change in the study of issues, which has led to a shift in the conceptualization of issues. Over the past 30 years, the focus of public opinion","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.  Fourth are “nature of the times”, when evaluations of candidates and parties are tied to general perceptions about",0.428076,0.99962,18.298121,0.996721,0.634437,4.271395,-3.8716044425964355

A few years ago, there was a big debate on whether or not it was better to buy used or new instruments. The original question was whether used was cheaper than new, but the debate has become something more along the lines of which is better: used or new?

I think the answer lies in the quality of the instrument. If you’ve played a new instrument before, it probably won’t have any body work. It won’t have been dropped or played on. It will be in tune, it will be in tune to the right notes, and it will have been played accurately.

When buying a used instrument, you’ll have to consider what you’re getting into. You could be buying a used instrument that’s been played over the years. That could be a good thing if it’s a quality instrument, but it can also be a bad thing if it’s been played and the strings are loose and the tuning is off.

Why buy new and not used?

The answer is that used instruments are few and far between. The instruments you’d get if you bought used are often made of inferior materials, older technology, and are generally a large part of their cost. That’s not to say you can’t buy used, but it’s a decision you should make with your personal needs in mind.

If you’re looking for a new instrument, you should be able to find one that’s more than adequate for your needs. If you’re looking for a used instrument, you should be able to find one that’s much better than what’s offered to you.

What to look for in a new instrument?

When buying a new instrument, you’ll have to consider the quality of the instrument. If you’ve played a new instrument before, it probably won’t have any body work. It won’t have been dropped or played on. It will be in tune, it will be in tune to the right notes, and it will have been played accurately.

It’s not that you can’t buy a new instrument with body work. Many used instruments have been modified, or have had their bodies worked on.

I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of the show “Psych” but a few episodes ago, they had a scene with a young woman who had just gotten out of a mental hospital, and while she was being transported, she got the chance to see a small child who had been abandoned in a trash can. The child had maggots crawling all over him and she asked the driver to kill her baby, and he was like, “No. I’m not gonna kill your baby. What are you going to do about that?” The kid was probably going to die anyway. He said, “I’ll leave him. I’ll leave him in the trash can.” And the girl started to cry and he said, “There’s nothing you can do. You can’t make him live. You can’t make him not be dead.”

I think that this is the sort of thing that we are facing with the death penalty. It is not a guarantee that the person will live.

I saw this on tv in the spring, and I was shocked that someone would do that. It is one thing to leave a child in a trash can, but to leave a child in a trash can with maggots is just as bad.

I also read that the state of Oklahoma was planning to execute this woman, and that the parents wanted to have her executed. They were protesting the execution.

This is something that I’ve never heard of before. I’m really shocked that someone would do this. It’s not like she had a nice lifestyle and she had lots of money. She had this kid and she left him in the trash can. It’s just so horrible.

I’m glad to hear that the mother is planning to protest the execution of her child, and that this isn’t just another case of capital punishment being cruel and unusual punishment. It’s a really sad story, and it should be taken into account when making a decision regarding the death penalty.

Right, I think it’s a really sad story. I’ve never heard of anything like that.

History and Formation of the Doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas

The Doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas was founded by the Dominican St. Thomas Aquinas who lived in the 13th century. This doctrine is called the “Summa” (from Latin: summa meaning “complete”). St. Thomas’ Summa was not intended to be a systematic exposition of all knowledge, but rather a summary of the major dogmas of the Christian faith, arranged in a logical order. By the 14th and 15th centuries, the Summa was accepted as an official textbook of theology in most of Europe.

The Summa was translated into English several times. The first translation was made by Thomas Aquinas himself, and it was published in the year 1265. The original Latin translation was published in 1447. The most famous translation of the Summa was the one made by Alexander Hegius (also known as Johannes Baaderus) in 1543.

The Summa was written in the form of a dialogue, with each of the six questions being answered by a single question. Each question then provides materials for further discussion. In the Summa, St. Thomas addresses the major questions of philosophy and theology.

The Theological Doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas

The Doctrine of St. Thomas Aquinas is divided into three parts:

Part 1 , (Summa Theologica) contains the main theological doctrines of the Christian faith.

The greenhouse effect is the change in the amount of infrared radiation reaching the surface.

Why do people like cats?,"ation of things: 'as a way of getting over things. You get over things by being with them' (Aristotle, Poetics, 1453b.12).1 The contrast between the calm of cats and the tumult of life has its opposite in the violence of some animals and the disturbed nature of others. Animals in a state of constant anxiety are considered to be in a worsened condition than those who experience occasional stresses. Cats are the only animals that are commonly used as a metaphor for the calmness or quietness of a state of nature. Aristotle comments: 'It is not the wild beast that is in a tranquil state, but the gentle beast that is calm.'2 The calmness of cats as a metaphor for the state of nature is attributed to the fact that they are the only animals that both exist and live in a state of nature. Cats are the only animals that can exist in a state of nature and live in it. Aristotle also comments on this fact: 'If a lion had been born, it would have been a bird instead of a lion. But, because it is not possible that a lion should be born, and because the nature of the lion is best, the lion is the only animal who is both the best in nature and able to be born' (Aristotle, Poetics, 1453b.12). The calmness of cats as a metaphor for the state of nature is attributed to their being the only animals that both exist and live in a state of nature. Aristotle can be said to be using the calmness of cats as a metaphor for the state of nature, which is a state of non-violence, because cats are the only animals that are able to exist and live in a state of nature. Aristotle also comments on this fact: 'A lion is the only animal that is able to live in a state of nature, and a lion is the best in nature' (Aristotle, Poetics, 1453b.12). The calmness of cats is attributed to their being the only animals that are able to exist and live in a state of nature. The calmness of cats as a metaphor for the state of nature is not taken as a metaphor for the state of nature. It is only the calmness of a cat that is a metaphor for the state of nature.

Describe ways to deal with naughty kids as a parent,".DirtyHack.

Now, I’m not saying that the parents of naughty kids aren’t worth teaching children how to behave, because I wouldn’t want to annoy the hell out of my adult kids, too. But there are some things that work better for me than others, and I’m going to share what I’ve discovered, because I think it will help you as well.

First, understand that you can’t be there for everyone. You have to deal with people who are not amenable to your ways. Yes, you can try to make everyone happy with your parenting, but if the people you’ve married or have been married to are not interested in being happy, then you’ll have to figure out how to deal with that. I don’t mean that you can’t spend time with them, and I don’t mean that you can’t spend time with them, just that you can’t act like you’re going to spend 24 hours a day with them. If you try to do that, you’re going to be miserable, and the people you love will not be happy with you.

That doesn’t mean they won’t love you, just that they won’t love you any more than they love themselves. That’s… how I feel about myself. I mean, I’m the one who’s supposed to be the parent, but I’m the one who’s actually the parent. And I don’t want to be the one who’s the parent, because I’m not supposed to be the parent. I don’t have to be the parent, but I am the parent. And I have to be the one who’s a parent.

So, it’s not that I’m not a good parent, it’s that I have to be the one who’s a parent. I can’t be the parent. I should be the parent, but I can’t be the parent. I have to be the parent.

And it’s not that it’s wrong to be a parent, it’s just that I’m the parent.

I should have an answer for this, and I have an answer for this, but I don’t have an answer for this, because I’m not the one who has to deal with this. So, I’m going to be a little vague about","Well, there is no 1 exact rule that applies to all, there are many things which impact how a kid behaves. But one of the main things to remember is kids learn more by observation than when it's told to them. As a parent, an important thing to remember would be to practice what you preach. Usually, we put restrictions on screen time for kids, but remember even we are answerable to them when we spend too much time on gadgets than with people around us. We expect kids to respect us, so the same holds good for us, try to behave with them the way you to see them behave with you. Try to dedicate a few hours to spend time with them, remember it's the quality and not the quantity that matters here. Try not to correct them for everything they do, and try to set a boundary on things you can let go of. It's not a kid's job to deal with kids after all so you need to have some patience to understand them and then try to be understood.",0.004118,0.203424,17.917332,0.852342,0.002937,3.796031,-3.5750246047973633

One way to efficiently start learning something would be to understand the fundamentals first and dive deeper into the subtopics as you get more familiar with the core concepts. Read as much as possible and create an outline on the topic. Leverage the five Ws technique of problem solving - Who, What, When, Where and Why.

There are numerous ways to get familiarized with concepts. One way to do it would be to jot down your notes, try to make connections and try to simplify the ideas if possible. Assume that you are trying to explain this to a five year old, how would you build the topic, make it interesting either by visualizations, metaphors etc.? 

Another beneficial technique that can be of good help here, would be to put the concept into application in some form or the other. This can be done by either practicing the concepts in real life if feasible, or by observing its presence and relevance. 

Finally, try and teach the concepts to others. This is an extremely effective way to gain fluency and expertise on a subject.",0.051383,0.433267,8.631519,0.684951,0.045839,1.969392,-4.355534553527832

He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

Why should people convert lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants?,"Ing up to 0.1m wide and 1m long, most ornamental and weed plants have been brought to Australia from overseas. The plants are mainly from Europe and North and South America. They include a range of vegetable, flower and herbaceous plants. These plants have escaped from cultivated garden areas into natural areas such as grasslands, woodlands and scrub. they are also a problem for native wildlife. They compete with native plants for light and nutrients. They can become very large and can smother other plants. They can also take over native habitat. In addition, they can be highly invasive, spreading out from their original habitat. They can become a health hazard, clogging drains and causing localised flooding.They are also pests, often introduced by people moving from overseas to Australia. Weeds frequently dominate native communities and can result in a loss of habitat and the interruption of species.As well as being a nuisance, weeds cause significant damage to native ecosystems. They can render some habitats useless, such as riverbanks, meadows and the edges of watercourses. They can also cause significant damage to native ecosystems by reducing sunlight and water and nutrients. They can also have a negative impact on native plants through competition and are a vector for disease. They are also a major cause of erosion.In addition, weeds are a major cause of nutrient depletion and can cause soil erosion and water pollution. They can also be a source of secondary infection in the soil. Wicked weeds are even more of a concern as they can spread such diseases as anthrax and botrytis. they can also spread invasive species to new areas. The problem of weeds is not only a problem for Australia. Weeds are a problem worldwide.Weeds also compete with native plants for light and nutrients. They are also a major cause of soil erosion. When weeds grow in high densities, they smother other plants and reduce light availability. They also reduce the amount of available water. They are a major cause of nutrient depletion and can cause soil erosion. They can also be a vector for disease.Because of the problems caused by weeds, many countries have introduced laws or regulations, such as zoning laws, to restrict their spread. The European Union has a system for classifying weeds. It allows the classification of weeds and their control. The United Nations General Assembly has recognised the problem of weeds and has urged member states to promote sustainable use of weeds and waste.

The Australian Government has a program aimed at reducing the number of weeds in gardens. It is known","Who doesn’t love butterflies? They are a beautiful symbol of innocence. But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?

One of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.

The other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a",0.371753,0.986957,27.870929,0.9717,0.404906,6.121249,-3.811739921569824

The AWD drive system is designed for mild inclement weather conditions such as light snow, ice and rain. It is not designed for off-roading or severe weather conditions such as heavy snow or mud. This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. 

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease. The 4WD system is most commonly found on trucks, Jeeps and other purpose-built vehicles designed for heavy-duty use, whether for work or pleasure.",0.239395,0.985173,26.321755,0.997973,0.221439,5.753147,-2.8778562545776367

What are some ways I can improve my general health during my work day?,"Weekly

Working conditions can be quite stressful, but your body has to cope with it somehow. Stress is a physiological response to any kind of threat, and so it's important to nurture and protect our bodies at the workplace.

The following tips may help you maintain good health as you work.

1. Eat healthfully

Eating healthfully is important at the office, so make sure you're eating a balanced diet, including protein.

If you can't eat a healthy diet, eat smaller meals to keep your energy up.

2. Get plenty of sleep

If you're stressed at the office, you may find that you need more sleep. Sleep can be difficult to get at work, but it can be quite beneficial to your health.

When you're stressed, your body goes into fight-or-flight mode. This means that your body will prepare for the fight or flight. If you are in a fight-or-flight mode, and your body is not getting enough sleep, you may be vulnerable to illness, fatigue, and injury.

If you do not get enough sleep, you may find it hard to perform at your best. Even if you do not need to sleep, make sure you get enough.

3. Stretch regularly

If you're working out in the office, you may need to stretch at least two or three times a week. Stretching releases tension in muscles, which can help your body function more effectively.

Stretching also helps you relax, which can help you work more productively.

4. Get enough fluids

Dry, salty, and warm foods may make you more prone to illness and fatigue.

Drink enough water throughout the day. Make sure you drink water with meals, and drink enough during the day to avoid dehydration.

5. Stay active

Staying active can help you stay healthy at the office. Regular exercise can help you relax, relieve stress, and get rid of tension.

If you're able to, take the stairs instead of the elevator. If you are in an office where others are working, work out in a different part of the building. Go for a walk, or jog.

6. Take breaks

If you are in an office setting, it's important to take breaks. You may not feel like you need to take breaks, but you may be missing out on valuable opportunities to relax and","There are a number of things you can do to improve your general health during your working day. You can use a standing desk or a desk treadmill. You may be able to go for a walk while on a phone or conference call. It is also good to try and fit in some time for activities such as visiting the gym, doing yoga or meditating.",0.108537,0.999133,24.980601,0.861956,0.166905,5.423426,-6.086912631988525

What was Nicola Yoon's first published novel?,", a four-volume, epic fantasy series with the same name which was published from 2009 to 2013. She is also the author of the fantasy series The Marked, and the young adult novel The Red Pearl. She lives in New York City.

What was Nicola Yoon's first published novel? The Marked.

Joanne Fluke: What do you do?Nicola Yoon: I’m a writer.

Joanne Fluke: You have a degree in English literature. How did that lead you to writing?Nicola Yoon: Well, firstly, I was a very good singer. I took voice lessons in college, and when I stopped, I realized that I hated my voice. It’s not a joke; that’s not something you get over. You just stop doing it, and you get very uncomfortable.

The second thing is that I grew up in a Jewish household. My mother is a Holocaust survivor, and we were very observant, and we were in the synagogue every week. The final thing is that I’m a firm believer in the practice of writing. I see that very much in my family and in my community. My father is an orthodontist, and he’s written a couple of books, but he’s also very good at speaking in front of large audiences.

Joanne Fluke: How long have you been writing?Nicola Yoon: I’m twenty-four years old.

Joanne Fluke: You’re not twenty-four any more.Nicola Yoon: Well, once you’re twenty-four, you’re old.

Joanne Fluke: So you’re kind of old for your age.Nicola Yoon: I’m gettting there. I have a girlfriend who’s almost twenty-two, and she’s already been married. You know, I’m getting there.

Joanne Fluke: What was the motivation for writing The Marked?Nicola Yoon: I think the reason that I wanted to write The Marked was that I love stories that are about the human condition. I think that’s what was drawing me to it, that it’s about the human condition and the struggles that we all face.

Why are some people vegetarian?,", a vet who has been feeding dogs and cats for many years, says: “I’m a meat eater, but I know it’s a health issue and I don’t really eat it. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink alcohol and I don’t eat much red meat. I’m not a fan of poultry either, but I don’t know why they eat it.”

Who loves the hamburger?Jennie, a long-term vegetarian who is also into a vegan and raw-food diet, says: “I know it’s a health issue, but I don’t like the taste of it. I’m a bit of a fan of the hummus sandwich. I like the taste of it, and it’s a good way of getting your protein in. I find it quite cheezy, though!”

Why is bacon and ham so popular?Jane, a long-term vegetarian who is also into a raw-food diet, says: “Bacon is a very healthy product. It’s a good source of protein, and it’s a good source of fat. I don’t like the taste of it, but I find that I can eat it when I’m ill and I feel better afterwards.”

Why is it that some people with no meat diet at all are also healthy?Rachel, a vegan and raw-food dietitian, says: “I find that people who are vegetarian or vegan can also have a healthy diet. Although they may not eat meat, they can still eat plenty of fruit and vegetables, as well as nuts, seeds, grains, beans and pulses. This means that their diet is full of essential nutrients, and they are also a healthy weight.”

Why is it that some people who are vegetarians or vegans have cancer?Jane, a raw-food dietitian, says: “I don’t know why some people who are vegetarians or vegans have cancer. Some people who are vegetarian or vegan may feel that they do not need to eat meat and meat products. Some may be allergic to them. This is a very individual thing. Some people who are vegetarian or vegan eat a lot of nutritional yeast, for example, which is a great source of B vitamins and protein. Some people who are vegetarian or vegan are not strict vegetarians or vegans, but they eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and fish.”

","There are many reasons for being vegetarian. Some religions prohibit eating meat. Other people prefer not eat meat because they consider it immoral. The environmental impact of the meat industry has convinced other groups of people to stop eating meat to reduce their carbon footprint. Lastly, some people simply do not enjoy the taste of meat, or find it too expensive to purchase.",0.983523,0.99863,13.829764,0.999153,0.995342,3.561282,-3.867555856704712

This is a little off topic but I would like to see the rest of the world follow the USA when it comes to gun laws. This is a very sensitive subject for me, and I hope that the rest of the world is smart enough to not follow the USA.

04-27","The United States has become a victim of its past as it relates to its gun culture. The 2nd Amendment was ratified in 1791, which at the time seemed appropriate given that the United States had just waged a war against England for its freedom. However, more than 200 years later, the 2nd Amendment no longer solely ties itself to its original intent: to protect itself and its people. The prevalence of guns in the United States has led to the United States having the highest gun ownership rates in the world. This in turn has resulted in many inexplicable acts of gun violence that have cost innocent lives and traumatized many.",0.325817,0.737182,3.22798,0.824588,0.288505,1.080814,-10.190974235534668

A common path is to enroll into a higher education institution which often have rigorous curricula which will equip you with the fundamentals. 

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.

I am a country girl and I really miss eating things like that.I would really like to know what the people in the North eat.

A: If you are interested in the food culture of the South of Korea, I suggest you read the book ""Food of the gods"" written by Robert M. Quine.

Hello,

Who is the greatest musical theatre composer of all time?,"as?

That's a good question, and it's the type of question that we ask all the time. In fact, we spent a good chunk of our time at the end of 2013 talking about this very subject.

We have a list of some of the greatest composers of musical theatre, and most of them have been around for a long time, but who is the greatest composer of all time? That's a tough question.

Who's your favourite composer?

I would say that I like a lot of different composers. I like the Germanic composers, I like some of the French composers, and I like a lot of the American composers.

What's your favourite work by that composer?

Well, I would have to say that I like some of the work of Igor Stravinsky and I like a lot of the work of Richard Rodgers, too.

Why?

Well, there are some really good pieces by both of them. I was a huge fan of the Rodgers and Hammerstein productions. I think that they were great productions, and I think that the way they were done with the choreography, the way they were brought together with the music, and the way that the sets were done, the way that the costumes were done, and the way that the lighting was done all helped to make the show great.

I'm the first to admit that I have no musical theatre knowledge whatsoever, but I'm also the first to acknowledge that Stravinsky's music is very difficult to listen to and understand.

But you know what I really like about it? It's enormously exciting. It's a lot like the stuff that I listen to. He had this tremendous drive and passion for music. And not only did he work with the orchestra in a way that I have never heard before, but he also used orchestration, which was a technique that I really like.

I think that he just had this insane drive and it's always exciting to see music being made.

You mentioned that you had a long conversation with another composer about music.

Yes. I know a lot of people think that I'm a snob, but I actually think that I have a very good knowledge of music. I've always been interested in music, and I've always been more interested in the scores than the music that I heard.

I've always been more interested in the music than the scores that I've heard.

","While art is subjective, there are a few luminary composers who have made significant contributions to musical theatre and whose work has stood the test of time. One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having ""hummable"" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with ""Send in",0.285731,0.994648,13.974407,0.94443,0.23013,3.285869,-4.41493558883667
What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,:gjt:,"There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. 

There are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.",0.22686,0.002865,0.015379,0.075473,0.200194,0.104154,-8.544816970825195

Gift Cards

Gift cards are a great way to get an out-of-the-ordinary gift. You can buy a gift card for any occasion, like a birthday, anniversary, graduation, or even to send to a friend. If your friend loves perfume, buy him a gift card. If your friend is a perfume blogger, buy him a gift card to give to his readers!

Gift cards have a wide range of benefits for both merchants and consumers. For merchants, the best part is that they get to keep most of the value of the gift card. For consumers, many times they use a gift card for a honeymoon, a vacation, or even to pay for a car repair.

Make sure your gift card is for an item that is easily redeemable. This way, you have a good chance of getting a refund or a gift card in that case.

Buy your own perfume.

Every time you buy perfume, buy some yourself. You don’t need to buy your own perfume because everyone should know that perfume is a very good investment.

If you bought your own perfume, you can exchange it for a perfume at a store that does not have your perfume.

Behind the scenes of this tutorial you will be provided with a list of resources to help you with your project. Make sure to check the end of the article for a list of these resources.

Follow the essential steps below and you can create your own perfume design.

Step 1: Choose a theme

The first step of creating your own perfume design is to choose a theme. It will help you to focus on the design because you will be able to avoid distractions that can lead you away from the task at hand.

There are many types of themes that you can choose from. You can choose a theme that represents a topic that you are interested in. For example, the theme “Love” is a good theme for revealing your feelings about romance.

The theme “Love”

You can also choose a theme that represents something that you are passionate about. For example, a theme that represents your passion for fashion, or a theme that represents your passion for food.

Thinking about a theme before you start can help you focus on the task at hand.

Step 2: Choose a base color

For the first step, choose","Hi

I recently ordered one of your perfume bottles. When the bottle arrived, I was disappointed to find out that there was a crack in the glass, and that some of the contents of the bottle had leaked into the surroundings. Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for me to use the bottle, or to take it on a trip for fear of further leaks.

Is there any chance you could refund the price of the bottle, or alternatively send me a new one?

How can Bernoulli's principle be derived from Newton's second law of motion?,"uq, A. Bernoulli's principle can be derived from Newton's second law of motion in this way. In fact it is a corollary of Newton's second law, which can be written in the form F = ma where F is the force on an object, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration of the object. The second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the force on that object. Thus, the second law says that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the force on that object. A = F/m. Therefore, F is proportional to a. It follows that the force is proportional to the acceleration. Bernoulli's principle can be derived from Newton's second law by taking the derivative of a with respect to time. The derivative of a with respect to time is a = ma. Therefore, F is proportional to the acceleration. Therefore, F is proportional to a. Therefore, F = ma. How can Bernoulli's principle be derived from Newton's second law? 4.2.3 Newton's second law of motion can be used to derive Bernoulli's principle: Newton's second law of motion can be used to derive Bernoulli's principle. Newton's second law of motion can be used to derive Bernoulli's principle in this way. It can be shown that Bernoulli's principle can be derived from Newton's second law of motion in this way.

The pressure of a gas can be derived from Newton's second law of motion: The pressure of a gas can be derived from Newton's second law of motion in this way. In fact it","Bernoulli's principle can be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second Law of Motion. If a small volume of fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, then there is more pressure behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline.",0.081442,0.997675,27.0534,0.065003,0.049785,5.649461,-2.6219990253448486

When did the American Civil War end?," When did the American Civil War begin?

This was the first major American war to be fought on American soil. In the words of the United States Declaration of Independence, “proclaimed in Congress assembled, and by the authority of the same, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.” The war was fought for the preservation of these rights in the Southern states, and the United States’s involvement was subsequently justified as an effort to preserve the union of these states. In the end, the war ended in 1865 when the Confederate states surrendered. The war officially ended on April 9, 1865.

The war was started when the South seceded from the union. This was supposedly because the majority of the South’s population was against slavery. This was seen as their way of trying to gain freedom from slavery by seceding from the union. This was because of the fact that the majority of the South’s population was in favor of slavery. The South’s secession was illegal, and the new state of Texas was declared a slave state. This was done under the assumption that slavery would be abolished in the South, and the South would no longer be in the union. The new state of Texas was part of the union until four years later. After the war ended, slavery was abolished in the South. This was due to the fact that an amendment to the constitution was made in 1865, which was in the form of the 13th amendment. This stated that slavery was abolished by the end of the war.

The war became a conflict that was fought over slavery, and this was because of the fact that slavery was the major reason for the war, and the abolition of slavery was seen as the main reason for the war ending. This was because there was opposition to slavery in the South. This is because the majority of the South’s population was in favor of slavery. This was also because slavery was seen as one of the main reasons why the South seceded from the union. The abolition of slavery was seen as the main reason why the North’s involvement in the war ended.

The war was fought over slavery for many different reasons. This is because there was opposition to slavery in the South. This is because the majority of the South’s population was in favor of slavery.

What kind of language is Shauraseni Prakrit,"?

I am trying to understand the various forms of Prakrit, which includes the language of the ancient inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent.  The Prakrits are not to be confused with the modern Hindi, which is very different from the languages of the ancient subcontinent.  
I know that Prakrit is a form of early literature.  I understand the word ""Prakrit"" to mean the relatively early world-language of the people who spoke Sanskrit.  My question is about the details of the Prakrit form.  For example, what are the differences between Vedic Sanskrit and Prakrit?  And what are the other different forms of Prakrit, and what are their differences?

A:

There is no one ""Prakrit"" form.

Sanskrit is an Indo-Aryan language closely related to Indian languages like Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali, etc.
On the other hand, Prakrit is a language that emerged in the 3rd century BCE, and is related to the languages spoken in parts of South Asia and North India.
Prakrit is the ""mother"" language of many languages in South Asia, and is often considered to be the mother tongue of many people in the Indian subcontinent. 
Prakrit is a language that is written in an alphabet called Devanagari, which is a descendant of the Siddham(Sanskrit) alphabet. Some of the oldest surviving texts are in Devanagari, and there are many other texts written in Devanagari.
Prakrit is also known by many other names, such as:

Sanskrit-Prakrita
Sanskritum-Prakritam
Sanskritum Indicum

Most of the material in this language originates from the 3rd to 10th centuries, though it was probably a spoken vernacular around the 2nd century BCE in the ancient state of Surasena. 

Among the Prakrits, Shauraseni is said to be the one most closely related to Classical Sanskrit in that it is derived from the Old Indian Indo-Aryan dialect of the Madhyadesa on which Classical Sanskrit was mainly based. Its descendants include the languages of the Hindi Belt, the Central Zone of modern Indo-Aryan or Hindi languages, the standard registers of the Hindustani language based on the Delhi dialect.",0.050899,0.869782,15.355542,0.960951,0.037149,3.454865,-6.891586780548096

How do I find my Tesla charging station?,"cer in a Tesla.

The two other things I found were the battery and the charger.

To begin with, my charger is in the person of my mother.

I asked her to do a search for her charger. She said it was an MCC charger.

I went to the Tesla store and asked about the MCC charger. It is a “Tesla charger” and is the standard charger for the new Teslas. The charger has a nifty little device hanging from it.

It is a two port charger. It charges the battery with a little plug in the top. The plug is easily removed from the charger and is held in place by a little spring.

The other port has a LED light that shows if the battery is charging. There is also a small LED that shows if the battery is being charged.

As the battery charges, the LED in the other port will flash, which means the charger is working.

The battery is located on top of the charger.

The charger is a simple to use device.

The battery is the most difficult to use device. It is the only one to be able to use the car and plug it in. There is no interface to use. The battery has an LED that shows how the battery is charging. The battery has a charging port that is a small round opening.

The easiest thing to do is to plug the battery into the charger.

The most difficult thing to do is to get the battery to fit into the charger.

There are several people who have tried to do this. There are several ways to get the battery into the charger. The easiest way is to take the battery out of the car and put it in.

This way the battery is not damaged.

If you are lucky, the battery will fit in the charger without any damage.

If not, you will damage the battery by trying to get it to fit in.

If you are not standing next to the charger, it is difficult to get the battery to fit.

It is very possible to get the battery to fit in the charger.

This is how you do it. Get the battery out of the car.

Put the battery on top of the charger.

Why do hindus worship idols?,"ation?

This is another great question that is often asked. In fact, it is a question that can be asked of any religion or belief system.

The answer is, we don't.Not all religions are like this.Yes, the people who believe in idols are a minority. But it is also true that the majority of the people who believe in God believe in God and are not idol worshippers.So, for the most part, the majority of the people who believe in God do not worship idols.

Just like the majority of the people who believes in science, the majority of the people who believes in God are not idol worshippers.But because we have to believe in God in order to be saved, we are forced to worship idols.

It is true that God is the only way to salvation, but it is equally true that there is another way besides God. And that is the way of salvation through the person of Jesus Christ.

A lot of people think that if they don't believe in God, they will go to hell. But the Bible teaches us that we will go to heaven.

And that's not just some idea Christians have made up. It is a fact that is taught in the Bible.

So, for the most part, the majority of the people who believes in God don't worship idols.

Question: If God is the only way to salvation, how come God allows people to go to hell?

Answer: It is the same as the fact that you can go to heaven. This is the reason the Bible says:

""It was not man that sinned, it was sin that sinned: in the day that God made man, and man became sin, he made sin unto men, to redeem them that were under the law: and that they might be justified by faith."" (Romans 3:23-24)

God allows people to go to hell because it is only by faith that we can be justified.

So, for the most part, the majority of the people who believes in God don't worship idols.

Question: How can the majority of the people who believes in God pray to God?

Answer: God is not a person. He is not a living thing. He is the creator of the entire universe and everything that exists. So, if you pray to God, you are actually praying to the universe.

And the universe",Religion is man made. History teaches us that Religion was invented to separate humans and create a fear. Religion and Faith are different. Hinduism is not a religion but on the contrary it is a way of life. There is no one leader or master in hinduism like in christianity or islam and it is totally inclusive. Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings. So start your day with a prayer to elephant god. Thus you have 1000's of idols each representing a specific character in humans.,0.093191,0.992908,15.624645,0.992132,0.066189,3.553813,-4.756209373474121

The primary colors are red, orange, yellow, and green. The reason why we are using primary colors is to represent what we are talking about. I know that colors are not fixed but they change depending on the light. For example, red is red when it is not illuminated by light. The color of the sky is blue and the color of the grass is green. We can change the color of the sky by using the sun. The color of the grass is green because the grass absorbs the light and it is green. The stars are not illuminated by light. The color of the stars is red. But, the color of the moon is blue. It is because the blue light from the sun is reflected by the moon.

When we talk about the primary colors, red, orange, yellow, and green, they are the most important colors.

Winners of 19 Grand Slam titles, Nadal has a record of 41-5 in finals, including 24 titles at Roland Garros. He is a four-time Wimbledon champion and a three-time US Open champion.

Nadal's best results on clay are his second round victories at the French Open and Wimbledon, but he also holds the record for most career wins on clay.

Nadal has won more clay titles (23) than anyone else in the Open era, including former champions Roger Federer (five) and Rafael Nadal (one).

Federer, Nadal and current world No 1 Novak Djokovic are the only men to win the event at least three times.

Nadal has always been ranked in the top three on the ATP World Tour before Wimbledon, but a knee injury in 2014 has prevented him from becoming No 1.

This year he won the season-ending Wimbledon title for the first time, and is a contender for a second title.

Nadal's career Grand Slam finals record is 18-3, but he has never won a major in his first four attempts.

In 2011, Nadal lost to Roger Federer in the final of the Australian Open in what was his first major final.

3","Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.",0.313902,0.955826,10.783796,0.814951,0.439591,2.661613,-10.140592575073242

With her brother-in-law out of town, Lisa had agreed to watch her niece Stella for the afternoon and the little girl was known to be a bit of a handful. Her plan had been to spend the afternoon at the park to let Stella run and climb, to wear her out a bit.  Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.

The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created.

Which of the following items are not a home audio device?

Table lamp, radio, television, rims, door, window, ceiling fan.

A:

It seems there are lots of different answers to your question.  To me it just seems that the answer to your question is ""it depends"".  I would say ""it depends"" on what you consider a home audio device.
I would say that the answer is ""it depends"" on whether or not the item is used in the home as a home audio device.
For example: If you have a television in your home and it is used to watch movies, or for other purposes, then I would say it is.  If you have a radio in your home and it is used for music, then I would say it is not.
Similarly I would say that a computer which is used for work would be a home audio device, but a computer which is used for home entertainment would not be.
A couch which is used to watch television on would be a home audio device, but a couch which is used to sit on would not be.
So really, the answer is ""it depends"" on what you are doing in your home when you use the item.
To think in terms of ""home audio devices"" versus ""non-home audio devices"", I would say that you could consider that a radio is a ""non-home audio device"" since it is used for music and not for anything which is directly related to the home like watching television.  But a table lamp is a ""home audio device"" because the only thing it is used for is for providing a light source in the home.  And then the computer is not a home audio device because the ""only"" thing it is used for is to work in the home.

A:

I would say ""it depends"" on the nature of the item.

The most common home audio devices include:

The radio, which is used for music, or the TV, which is used for movies.
The CD player, which is used for music.
The television, which is used for movies and TV.

The Annunciation of Jesus happened on the same day as the birth of Jesus, and celebrates the same event. The Church also celebrates the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary to Joseph, the Annunciation of Joseph to the Virgin Mary, and the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary to the infant Jesus. The Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary to Joseph is also a time of high veneration for the Blessed Virgin Mary and her Son.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary to Joseph is a very important day of the Church calendar. On this day, the Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus, and Christ is conceived in her womb. The Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus and the Virgin Mary simultaneously.

In the Church of Ireland, the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary to Joseph is called the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary. The Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary falls on the same day as the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary to Jesus. The Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary is celebrated by the blessing of the water in which the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descended upon the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, and in the Liturgy of the Holy Communion.

In the Anglican Communion, the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary to Joseph, the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary, and the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary to Jesus is known as the Feast of the Annunciation of the Holy Virgin Mary. This","(1) Aquarius (Water-Bearer)

"Identify which instrument is string or percussion: Clapper, Chagane",", Clapper, Percussion, Rattle, Percussion, Rattle, Rimshot, Rimshot

A:

It can be useful to know the instruments that are in the score. A good example is when you're alone and want to play a piece of music by yourself.
So let's assume that you're going to play a piece and you don't know how to get started.
The easiest way would be just to look at the score and try to remember what instruments are in the score.
If you know the name of the instrument and the name of the instrument in your language, you can also look it up. For example, if you play an instrument with a name like ""clapper"" and you know that the instrument is a clapper in English, you can look up ""clapper"" in the dictionary or in the internet and you will get the name of the instrument.
Another way is to just look at the page with the score. For example, here is the page for the piece ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" in the ""pianoforte"" section of the score of the Bach Cello Suite No. 1:
http://www.bachscore.com/en/Score/Bach/Bach-Cello-Suite-No-1-piano-f.html
The first part of the score on the left is the name of the instrument. You can see the name of the instrument by looking at the second line from the left and the name of the instrument in your language by looking at the first line from the left.

What medicinal plants should I grow in my Mid-Atlantic garden?,".com

The mallow family of plants is a very common flower in the Mid-Atlantic region. The blooms are brightly colored and the leaves are small and delicate. They are difficult to grow in our climate but if you are patient you can have quite a few of them. Most mallow plants are evergreen, but some of them are deciduous. The mallow family is easily confused with the lily family; they are both in the same family.

The most important medicinal plants in your Mid-Atlantic garden should be those that have been grown by Native Americans for thousands of years. These plants are called ""healing plants"" since they are used for healing. The plants have been used for treating many ailments. There are many different species of these plants, but most of them have one thing in common: All are good for strengthening the kidneys and for supporting the liver.

If you are planning to grow mallow, you should know that there are three kinds of mallow plants:

1. _Mallow_ – most mallow plants are called ""mallows."" They have large leaves and flowers.

2. _Mallow_ – the second type of mallow plant has small leaves and flowers.

3. _Althaea officinalis_ – the third type of mallow plant has smaller leaves and does not produce flowers.

Most of the mallow plants that are grown for medicinal purposes are grown as annual plants. They grow very quickly and they flower and produce seed in the fall. When they begin to flower, they are ready to be harvested. The plants should be harvested when they are producing plenty of flowers and seed. You can plant mallow in the garden in late summer and harvest it in the winter.

If you are going to grow mallow plants you should know that there are two kinds of mallow plants that you will want to be able to grow in your garden. The first is called ""mallows"" and they have large leaves and flowers. The second kind of mallow plant is called ""mallow"" and has smaller leaves and flowers.

If you want to grow mallow, you should know that the first type of mallow plant that is called ""mallows"" can be grown in a sunny spot in the garden. They are grown for their flowers, but they are also good for the leaves and the roots. The flowers are very fragrant and the leaves are used for medicinal purposes.

Name some titles from the Goosebumps series.," has been written over the past several years by Robert Serrano, also known as Jay, and is a collection of 39 short stories. In addition to the short stories, there are also three novellas, the first of which is titled The Mothman Enigma. In addition to the novellas, there is also a short comic, titled The Great White Hand, created by Jay. The comic is a parody of the movie The X-Files.

The novellas and short stories are standalone self-contained works with no direct connections to one another, although there are some cross-over elements.

The first novella, The Mothman Enigma, takes place in Los Angeles, California, in the late 1980s. The protagonist, Peter Pernak, is a high school student who is forced to confront a mysterious creature that has been seen in Los Angeles for several years.

The second novella, The Mothman Enigma, takes place in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1990s. The protagonist, Peter Pernak, is a high school student who is forced to confront a mysterious creature that has been seen in Chicago for several years.

The third novella, The Great White Hand, takes place in London, England, in November 2005. The protagonist, Anna Sorenson, is a prostitute with a past in the London underworld.

The short stories are set in different places in California, Chicago, and London. They are all told from the point of view of a male protagonist (the vast majority are of the male protagonist, the only exception being ""The Mothman Enigma"" in which the protagonist is a female and the story is told from the point of view of the female protagonist). The short stories are generally quite short, usually under 10 pages, and are told in the first person. The stories are generally set in the present or the near future.

The short stories are set in the past or the present, and are told from the point of view of the protagonist. The short stories are generally quite short, usually under 10 pages, and are told in the first person from the perspective of the protagonist.

"Group the following into manmade and non-manmade (naturally occurring) items: computer, salt, fence, tree stump, hillock, lightbulb, terracotta planter, snow, wolves, tablecloth, periodicals, museum",", and the like. (Note that we do not count anything that is a natural extension of itself or of its environment. For example, it is natural for a computer to be manmade.)

With the exception of the woodworm, every manmade item mentioned above was our own creation. Even if it was found in nature, it was not a natural extension of it. The computer was the result of a human mind competing with others, and it was the product of an individual mind. The salt was produced by a mind, the tree stump was the result of a mind, the hillock was the work of a mind, the lightbulb was the product of a mind, the terracotta planter was the result of a mind, and the wolves were the creation of a mind.

The computer was manmade, but if the computer was made by a human mind, it was also a non-manmade item. Because it was the product of a human mind, it was not a natural extension of itself or its environment. The computer, in fact, was the creation of a mental process.

Because the human mind is the only mind capable of creating a computer, it is the only mind capable of creating a natural extension of itself or of its environment. So there is no such thing as a natural extension of the nervous system.

The only natural extension of the nervous system is the brain.

# 2: THE BRAIN IS NOT NATURAL

You have a brain, you have a nervous system, and you have a whole bunch of other stuff too. But the brain has a special role: the role of a repository for the memory of the things that are not the brain itself.

If all the material that is not the brain was removed, then, nothing would remain except the brain itself, which contains no memory of the things that are not the brain. If the brain were the only thing in the universe, then the universe would be empty. But the only reason the universe is empty is that the universe is composed of things that are not the brain.

To be sure, the brain has no memory of itself. It does not know what it is or what it was, except that it was the brain that contained the memory of all the things that are not the brain itself.

The brain does not have all the memory of the universe. The brain is a cogent part of the universe, but it is not the whole universe. The","Manmade: computer, fence, lightbulb, terracotta planter, tablecloth, periodicals, museum

Who are the CEO of National Association of Broadcasters," Noel, and what did he do to earn his current position?

As a kid, Noel grew up listening to radio. His mother was the news director at a radio station in Philadelphia, and Noel received his first job there when he was 14.

In 1961 the FCC voted to allow broadcast television to compete with radio, and Noel helped launch the first broadcasting license in Philadelphia. He also helped start the first television station in Philadelphia.

By 1969, he was the president and CEO of the National Association of Broadcasters. In 1972, he was appointed by President Richard Nixon to the Federal Communications Commission.

For the next two decades, Noel’s career was largely concerned with technology. He was a founding member of the American Broadcasting Companies, and served as its chairman. He also was a founding member of the National Association of Broadcasters, and served as its president.

In 1981, Noel was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Federal Communications Commission to serve as its chairman.

Noel was known for being an aggressive champion of expanded access to radio. In 1994 he wrote a letter to the FCC urging it to remove its ban on low-powered radio stations, which he argued would force the Federal Communications Commission to lift the ban on low-powered radio stations.

In the early 2000s, Noel was a driving force behind the creation of the Cable Television Bureau of Adjudication, which is responsible for making cable television programming decisions.

In 2004, Noel was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Federal Communications Commission.

In 2008, Noel was appointed by President Barack Obama to the Federal Communications Commission.

In 2012, Noel was appointed by President Barack Obama to be the vice chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.

In 2013, Noel stepped down as chairman of the National Association of Broadcasters, citing his age and health issues.

Noel’s net worth is estimated to be between $67 million to $109 million.

Noel is married to Clare Noel, and together they have four children.

So there you have it. The man who helped to make broadcasting more technologically advanced and more accessible to the public had a net worth of about $67 million to $109 million.

It is clear that Noel was a successful businessman. He also was a fighter for the public’s right to access to radio and television.

What is VCF?

VCF is a specification of a format for storing variant calls of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELs) in a simple format. The VCF format is used by the VCF-toolkit, which was developed at the University of California, San Diego, and is freely available.

VCF files are plain text files (.txt format) that contain information about the variants that are observed in a VCF file. The VCF file format is independent of the variant caller being used. The primary purpose of VCF file format is to be able to re-use the variant caller's output. Each variant is represented by a VCF record that includes the following information:

Variant type (SNV, indel, etc)

Reference sequence (or gene)

Variant position (in the reference sequence)

Information about the quality of the VCF record

The information about the variant type, position, reference sequence, and quality of the VCF record is contained in a tab delimited text format.

When a VCF record is imported to Galaxy, the gene is also presented as a dropdown list, which allows you to browse through the variants and easily navigate the VCF file. By default, the VCF file is not imported. If you are importing the VCF file, you need to","Variant Call Format (VCF) is a file format used for storing and transferring genetic data.

Do all dog breeds have long tails?,"ation: I'm assuming you're talking about the tails, because if you're talking about the necks, the answer is no.

I agree with you there. I'm not saying they should not be able to do it, but I do say that the likelihood of a popular breed ending up with a more aggressive or wild look is very high, and it's something the breed should be able to control.

The truth is that the majority of dogs are bred to be the kind of dog that would make the perfect family pet, if they were allowed to do so.

They don't understand how to behave properly in a home environment without being beaten or starved. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.

## **BRAIN-BOOSTING TIPS**

**•** It's important to make your own soy sauce. I find that the smaller the glass bottle, the better. If you buy soy sauce, or if you're making Japanese dishes, there's no need to make your own.

**•** If you can't find any frozen tofu, use fresh tofu. It takes less time and is much cheaper than using tofu that's been frozen.

**•** The best way to cook frozen tofu is by steaming. If you don't have a steamer, use a saucepan and heat it to a boil. Add the tofu and simmer for about 5 minutes, until it is soft","Produce:

What are the parts of a sail?,"Medieval shipbuildingSails have the important function of propulsion, but also have an important decorative role. They can be composed of various materials such as canvas, kevlar, and even wood. The following topics describe the parts and construction of a sail.Parts of a sail.The sail assembles from a series of thin, flexible sheets.Each of the sheets has a hand-sewn or machine-sewn seam, which is sewn in an overlapping fashion along the length of the sail. The seams are actually sewn in such a way that they do not have to be fastened, but instead are held in place by the tension of the sail itself. Only a small number of loose sailmaker’s stitches separate the seams, and this number is generally only one per seam.The material of the sail is the single most important factor in how well the sail works. Diverse types of fabric are used in different types of ships. Sailmakers can choose from a variety of different cloths, such as canvas, hemp, and sea-grass. The canvas sail is the most common on traditional, sail-powered ships. Other types of cloths are used, for example, on early, sailing ships. The cloths are joined together using a variety of methods, including sewing, lacing, and braiding. The most common method is to stitch the cloths together, usually with a single stitch per seam. This method is also sometimes referred to as “hand-sewing.” The yardage of the sail is adjusted by the sailmaker, typically by sewing additional cleats or tack stitches along the length of the sail. The sailmaker also adjusts the shape of the sail to conform to the different conditions.Sail strength and construction.A sail is stitched to a mast (the upper part of a mast that can be raised or lowered independently of the main mast). The mast is held in place by the sail, and the mast is connected to the ship’s deck through the deck rigging. The mast and the sail are made of wood, and the two are usually connected by a crossbar. The sail is stitched to the mast from the bottom up, so that the sail begins at the bottom of the mast. The sailmaker then staples or nailed the sail to the mast for strength.As a sail is stitched to the mast, a single line of stitching runs between the two. This single line of stitching is called the “foresail line.”","The parts of a sail are: Head, Leech, Clew, Foot, Tack, and Luff.",0.267849,0.999376,16.9298,0.91263,0.324136,3.886758,-3.75655198097229
How do I get better at bouldering?,": Self-improvement is a part of the mountain lifestyle, and I don’t think I’ve ever been better at bouldering and climbing than right now.

How to Boulder? (For Newbies)

By Chris Bunkers

Bouldering is much more than just climbing a boulder. As I climb and boulder, my strategy is always the same: I learn to listen to my body, and I listen to my body by paying attention to my heart rate and breathing.

The first thing I always do when I start a climb is listen to my heart rate. I’ve found that I need to be at a relatively low heart rate to climb, so I try to keep my heart rate slow and steady. If I’m climbing with a friend, I’ll listen to my pulse in my ear, and my buddy will also listen to his heart rate. I find that listening to your pulse and heart rate can help you learn to pay attention to your body in a way that is completely different from just listening to your heart rate and breathing.

Bouldering is all about learning to listen to your body, which is not something you can do by just listening to your heart rate and breathing. I’ve learned that listening to my heart rate is a good way to get a baseline for what my heart rate will be while I climb. All the way up to a harder, more difficult climb, I listen to my heart rate with a watch or a GPS, but I’m learning that I can listen to my heart rate with my body even when I’m climbing.

The next thing I always do when I start a climb is listen to my heart rate. I use a watch or GPS to listen to my heart rate, but I also listen to my heart rate with my body. The cool thing about listening to your heart rate with your body is that you can listen to it with everything you’re doing.

I check my heart rate every time I get on a chairlift, even when I’m standing. I listen to my heart rate when I’m hiking, and I even listen to my heart rate while I’m climbing. I listen to my heart rate while I’m sitting on my couch, while I’m getting my hair cut, while I’m watching TV. I listen to it while I’m eating dinner. I listen to my heart rate when I’m getting ready to sleep.

Beavers is a young girl who's parents are divorced. Her father has left and she's trying to find out what has happened to her mother. This book is about her search for her mother.

A:

Beavers is a young girl who’s parents are divorced. Her father has left and she’s trying to find out what has happened to her mother.

This is a fairly straightforward answer.

A first paragraph that conveys that Beavers is a young girl who’s parents are divorced would be:

Beavers is a young girl who’s parents are divorced. Her father has left and she’s trying to find out what has happened to her mother.

Why do human beings react slow on climate changes?,"isone

Still, the study’s conclusion is that the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence is unlikely to narrow in the next 50 years.

It takes a surprisingly long time for the climate to respond to interventions. The study finds that past efforts to combat climate change have been stymied by the fact that it takes about 20 years for the climate to respond to policies implemented to help it. That means that the climate is unlikely to start changing before 2030.

What does this mean for the future?

The study suggests that the major climate actions we should be taking now, like reducing greenhouse gases and removing fossil fuels from the power grid, will not prevent the climate from changing. If anything, the study concludes that the climate will continue to change in the next 50 years without much help from humans.

The study’s authors say the findings should not be taken as evidence that the climate will not change in the future. They say it’s the “fundamental question” of whether humans can change the climate that the study is aimed at. The authors say they believe that we will be able to respond to climate change over the next few decades.

The authors also say they think the study is important because it shows that climate change is not a technical challenge, but a human challenge.

“It means that even with the development of a lot of smart technologies, the way we will be able to mitigate climate change is by changing our behavior,” said Florian Neusser, a study co-author and director of the Climate Change Institute at Germany’s Technical University in Munich.

The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday.

The study was funded in part by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The Climate Change Institute at Germany’s Technical University in Munich also received funding for the study.",People think it’s not hurting them on short notice and therefore don’t want to invest in it,0.004834,0.405825,11.059175,0.968067,0.002454,2.488071,-4.204513072967529

On the front page of all of them were stories about Saddam Hussein and the invasion of Iraq.  When we arrived in Borneo, we saw a two-page spread in a newspaper that dove into the history of Kurdistan. The very next article celebrated the liberation of Baghdad, the city juxtaposed against a backdrop of New York City in the United States.",".

“The next day we flew to Penang,” he narrated. “The local newspaper had an article about America helping to rebuild the city of Baghdad. That was the first time we had seen a photograph of Baghdad. The images were of a city that we had only heard about. It was awe-inspiring.”

“I grew up in a country that was constantly in war,” he continued. “My father was a senior official of the Korean government. I had never seen the battlefield. I had never seen the occupation of a city. I was always taught that war is the way of life. War is never a good thing. From a young age, my family and I had a focus on peace. We had to prepare for the unthinkable – that war could happen to us.”

“Yet, here I was sitting in a plane flying over the Middle East, and I saw a war that was being fought all around me.”

“When we arrived in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, we heard the news of the attack on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon,” he remarked. “The World Trade Center attack was the very first time we saw footage of 9/11. That was the first time we heard about the United States attacking Iraq. It was a shock.”

“We were finally able to see the reality of the war, and I was amazed at the accuracy of the images. There were photographs taken from the air of the Twin Towers. There were photographs taken from the ground of the Pentagon.”

“I was fascinated with the images. I was curious about what the images meant. I was curious about what combat looked like. I was incredibly impressed with the pictures.”

“That was the first time I had seen images of a plane hitting the Twin Towers,” he narrated.

“It was the first time I had seen a plane hit a building. I was amazed at the speed of the impact. I saw people flying up in the air. I walked out to the sidewalk in New York City and saw people falling to the ground. I had never seen that before.”

“I was shocked to see the devastation of the World Trade Center,” he continued. “The images were so vivid. I couldn’t believe how badly the buildings had been destroyed. I was so shocked at the loss of life that I could not believe what I was seeing. I had never seen such destruction.”

This is why tea is a popular beverage in the United States.Tea is made from leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. This plant is grown in different parts of the world, including China, India, and Japan.Tea has been used as a beverage since prehistoric times. The earliest records of tea drinking go back to China from around 1100 B.C.Tea is made in a tea bag, a simple method that requires less labor and gives a better taste.Tea bags are often used to make a tea latte. The tea bag is placed in a cup, and hot water is added. The hot water is poured into the cup, and the tea bag is discarded. The water is brought to a boil, and the tea is poured into the cup. The tea is often sweetened. The tea latte is served in a cup or mug. In other words, the tea latte is a drink made with hot water, sweetened with sugar, and flavored with something like cream.Tea is very easy to make.

When he asked me to write a book review, I accepted because I love the title and the book. I can't say I love it for the story or for the characters, but I do love it because of the title.

I know that some of you will think that it is lame, but I don't. Give me a chance to explain.

The book is called ""The Saddle Club."" It's written by a girl named Ann M. Martin, who is a very good writer. She's published books with other authors, but this one is her first book.

The Saddle Club is a group of four girls (and one boy) who are in a club for girls. The club members are: Anya, Jenny, Rosalie, and Jayne and their friend, Callie. Their parents are Jack's (the owner of the ranch) and Katie Taylor (the owner of the ranch). They live on a ranch called the Saddle Club Ranch.

Callie is a student who is not at all what you would think a ""student"" should be. He is a troublemaker. He's the one who leads the pranks. He makes up stories to get out of class. He's hard to please, and his real name is Callum, but he is trying to change it.

He likes to tell the girls the best stories. He is a nerd, but he is one of the funniest people in the whole town. He is in the band, and he sings. He is in the drama club, but he is not good at acting. He is a jokester.

Anya is a city girl. She has a good mind, and she can be a bit bossy. She likes to have fun, but she is not very gullible.

Jenny is a country girl. She's very pretty, and she is very sweet. She is really good at math.

Rosalie loves animals. She is good with horses. She is a tomboy, but she is very smart.

Jayne is a tomboy. She is very smart. She is a bad jumper, but she is very good at reading and writing. She is in the debate team.

At the beginning of the book, Ann M. Martin tells the story of the four friends and their friendship","California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas all border Mexico",0.007066,0.979939,2.252076,0.053936,0.003631,0.65933,-4.8389387130737305

What is a sonnet?,", 209.

Who are the sonnets? Sonnets are the most well known of the poetic forms in English. Sonnets are often written in couplets, and the rhymes usually have an ABABABAB ABA structure, but the pattern is flexible enough that there are many sonnet types. In addition to the popular type, there is long-form sonnet, alexandrines, meditations, couplets, hendecasyllables, and quatrains. Sonnets in the first group are often categorized as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" sonnets. Sonnets in the latter group are usually considered ""rhetorical."" In lyric poetry, sonnets are usually written in iambic pentameter, but this is not a requirement. The sonnet form is very common in English, but it is also found in languages such as Italian, French, and Spanish. Sonnets in English tend to be more formal, but they are not restricted to formal speech.

What are the sonnets? Sonnets are composed of 16 lines of varying length. The sonnet is usually written in iambic pentameter, though it is possible to write sonnets in other metrical forms. The sonnet has two rhymes per line, usually ABABABABA ABA, though ABABABA, ABABA, and ABA are also possible. There can be some variation in the number of lines in the sonnet, but the basic sixteen lines are always there.

What is the difference between a sonnet and a sonnette? Sonnettes are a form of poetry that was popular in England in the eighteenth century. The sonnette was a form of poetry that was popular in England in the eighteenth century. The sonnette was a form of poetry that was popular in England in the eighteenth century.

The couplet usually rhymes.",0.00116,0.008952,25.846341,0.028906,0.000845,5.177241,-3.8179593086242676
What are the different types of shots in ice hockey,"?

A:

The main types are:

Free shots: a shot from outside the attacking zone.
Inside shots: a shot from the attacking zone.
Hook shots: a shot from the attacking zone that goes behind the opposing goalie.
Penalty shots: a shot when the attacking team commits an offence that results in a penalty.

The goalie can make a save on any shot, but usually the attacking team will have a better chance of scoring if they use a free shot. If the free shot is unsuccessful, the opposing goalie can react by making a save on the inside shot, or using his blocker to block the shot, or by making a save on the subsequent shot. 
The inside shot can also be blocked, if the attacking team is able to anticipate the defenseman's movement. But the more successful the free shot, the less likely it is that the defenseman blocks it.
In the NHL, the goalies are not allowed to block any shot. A goal is scored only if the shot is blocked by a goalie.

A:

It is really difficult to say if a shot is ""good"" or bad. Since it is difficult to judge the quality of a shot, a good shot usually wins the game for the attacking team. 
There are three types of shots:

Free Shots: the attacking team kick the puck to a free position.
Inside Shots: the attacking team kicks the puck to the attacking zone.
Hook Shots: the attacking team kicks the puck to an area behind the goalie.

The quality of a shot depends on the ability of the player to hit the puck. The player should be able to hit the puck with the stick and at the same time have the necessary skills to make a good shot.
""A missed shot is better than a perfect shot."" - Gordie Howe

A:

A free shot is a shot that travels from one end of the ice to the other, without touching the boards.
A goal is scored when the puck crosses the goal line.
In ice hockey, a ""hook"" is a shot that goes behind the goaltender's blocker.
A penalty is when a player commits an offensive infraction, such as charging, boarding, elbowing, holding, or tripping, that results in a penalty.

"Write an friendly, convincing e-mail to my landlord asking whether I can get a dog",". The following is a copy of that e-mail:

""Dear Mr. Bloom,

I am in possession of documents showing that you have a history of violations of the lease, i.e., of the written rules of the city of San Francisco, including many violations of the city's noise ordinance. I am making this request because I am not willing to continue to have a landlord who is willing to violate the law yet continues to be a tenant.

If you are willing to agree to a mitigation plan to reduce the noise in the building, I will be willing to compromise on the terms of the lease, including the terms of the lease on any dogs in the building.

If you are not willing to agree to a mitigation plan, I will be forced to vacate the premises without reasonable notice, as allowed by law.

I am enclosing the list of the grounds for my objections to the lease, which include the fact that the building has no windows and that the building has been designated as being built for a hazardous material, as well as the fact that the building has been designated as a hazardous material building, and that the building has been found to have a history of violations of the city's noise ordinance.

Please respond to this letter as soon as possible, so that we can agree on the terms of the mitigation plan and finalize the lease.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Blake Thomas""

The landlord replied by sending a copy of the lease, showing that the dog was a service animal, and that the lease was for an apartment. The landlord also sent a copy of the dog's license. The landlord's only response to the letter was to write back that he was not willing to negotiate.

List different ways in which Nuclear power can be obtained based on the passage.,".

By the way, I’m increasingly convinced that the problem with the global warming debate is not the science. It’s the politics. The people who argue for action (“action” is not defined but seems to mean “reducing greenhouse emissions”) are mostly people who have a different set of values than the people who argue for inaction (“inaction” is not defined but seems to mean “let’s not do anything to address the problem”).

The folks who want action are basically libertarians, who want the government to do what the government has always done. The folks who want inaction are basically neoliberals, who want the government to do what the government has never done.

The question of what to do about global warming is a question of values. The people who argue for action are saying that we should do what has always been done. The people who argue for inaction are saying that we should do what is never done.

I’m now convinced that the people who argue for action are correct.

Global warming: a problem with no solution

By now, I think we can all agree that global warming is a problem that can’t be solved by merely reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

If global warming is a problem with no solution, then we must look for the cause.

The cause of global warming is a combination of two factors:

The world has been getting warmer, and

CO2 is causing the warming.

If the world is getting warmer, then the warming will continue. If CO2 is causing the warming, then the warming will continue, even if the world stops getting warmer.

Using the scientific method, we can determine that if the world keeps getting warmer, then CO2 will cause the warming.

That means there is a link between CO2 and global warming. The question then becomes “How much CO2 is too much?”

If CO2 is causing the warming, then CO2 has to be causing the warming. The best way to measure the amount of CO2 causing the warming is to measure the amount of warming caused by the CO2.

The best way to do that is to look at the data.

Here’s where it gets a little tricky, because the data that describes temperature changes, is not the data that describes the cause of those changes.

How do you play basketball,"?

Two things. One, you have to be mentally tough. You can't come in and be scared to play. I played with a bunch of guys who were basically scared to play. We'd go out and they'd be so scared they wouldn't even shoot. We'd have to tell them, ""We're not gonna play like that. We're gonna play real basketball."" You have to be mentally tough.

The other thing is, you gotta know how to play defense. You have to learn how to play defense. It's one of the most difficult things in the game, because you're playing against three guys. You have to be able to move, you have to be smart about where you're moving to, you have to be able to switch on the ball, and you have to know how to defend.

You have to know how to play the game. Part of the game of basketball is being smart and being able to make plays.

So you think you can be a center?

I definitely can. I played with some centers who can shoot and I see that you have to be able to shoot the ball, especially in a game like this.

Would you be available?

I would be available. I don't have to tell you, I'd love to play. I'm just trying to see what the situation is. I'm just trying to see what I can do to help.

I don't know.

What's your strategy for this game?

I'm trying to be smart about it. I'm trying to be smart about how to play the game. I'm not going to show up and try to show off.

There are two baskets that are 10 feet tall on each end of the court and the goal of the game is to get the ball into the basket at the opposing end of the court. Each basket is worth two points, unless the ball is shot from outside of an arc that is painted on the floor. If the shot it made outside of the arc, then it's worth three points. The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul. Basketball is more about finesse than it is about physicality.

Why mobile is bad for human,"Greater decision making capabilityMore independence from the limitations of the physical environment

But the reason why mobile is bad for human dignity is simple: it allows us to do more harm. Mobile phones have been the cause of the explosion of violence in our society. In addition to our physical violence, we are increasingly surrounded by a culture of cruelty, which we call ""feminism"". More than ever, we are perceiving women as objects, and more than ever we are willing to treat them as objects.

The mobile phone and social networks are the tools to allow more violent behaviours and more cruelty. When we have more power, we can do more harm; and when the same people have more power, they do more harm.

But what's worse is that we don't even notice it! We are so busy using our phones we don't even see what is happening around us! The situation is worse than you think. In some cases, mobile phones have been even used as weapons!

These are just some examples of the abuse that mobile phones have been used to inflict on us. We have to be careful. When we are in the subway, we should take a few moments to reflect on what is happening around us, and we should try to reflect on the consequences of our actions.

Mobile phones have been in our lives for too long. We have to try to find ways to take them out of our lives.

All this talk about mobile phones reminds me of those days when I first came to Paris. I was very nervous because nobody knew me. I was a foreigner. I was in a strange environment. I had no friends. I had no phone. I was alone, scared and worried. But I could connect with others because I had a phone. It was a miracle!

We need to find ways to connect with others. We must not be afraid of being alone, and we must not be afraid of connecting with others.

I believe that, in order to find peace in our society, we need to find a way to connect with others.

A society of connected people

In order to find peace in our society, we need to find a way to connect with each other. This can only be done by creating a culture of peace. We need to create a culture of peace, not only in our political and economical institutions, but also in our social, cultural and personal environment. We need to create a culture that is based on understanding and respect.",We are always engaged one phone which is not good.,0.414032,0.997271,18.91939,0.968292,0.357029,4.331203,-4.251275062561035

What are some former names for the city of Mumbai?," ferrumMumbai is the capital of the India state of Maharashtra and the largest city in the country, with a population of about 21.5 million. It is also one of the most densely populated urban areas in the world, owing to its location at the mouth of the Ganga and its trade routes.Mumbai was formerly known by both its English and Sanskrit names: Bombay, or Khandesh, and Mahabalipuram. The city was once known as Khandesh (Khandesh), meaning ""the land of the Khandes"". It derives from the Sanskrit कंडेस्ट, or ""city of the Khandes"", a reference to the Khandes, a group of small Hindu kings who ruled the area in the 9th and 10th centuries.Mumbai is one of the most heavily urbanised cities in the world, with more than 60% of the population living in urban areas. The city's population has grown from 1.4 million in 1950 to over 20 million in the present, and is projected to reach over 30 million by 2050. Mumbaikars are known as ""the most cosmopolitan people in India"", with over 500 different languages understood and spoken in the city.The city's name is derived from the Sanskrit words महाबाद, meaning ""the end of the sea"", and मङ्गा, meaning ""the city"". Mahabalipuram, a small town in the vicinity of the city, was the capital of the former state of Pemmarajupattanagar, and its name was given to the city by the British on the advice of Pemba Tahr, who visited the place on his way to Pune. The area's name was later changed to Mumbai. The name ""Mumbai"" is believed to have first appeared in English literature in the early 20th century, when it appeared in several popular novels, notably The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi.","The city of Mumbai carries its official name since 1995, some former names of the city were: Mombayn (1525), Bombay (1538), Bombain (1552), Bombaym (1552), Monbaym (1554), Mombaim (1563), Mombaym (1644), Bambaye (1666), Bombaiim (1666), Bombeye (1676), Boon Bay (1690), Bon Bahia, Bombay, Manbai, Mambai, Bambai",0.411387,0.998259,8.97506,0.969617,0.436075,2.358079,-3.336759567260742

"What was ""the Dry Capital of the World""?","; *It appears that there was ""no dry capital of the world in the days of the Romans."" Dry capital, here, means that which was (or has been) used for drying, and so has the meaning that is given to the word in dry goods stores. Dry capital is the capital that is devoted to the manufacture of yarns and fabrics. In the days of antiquity, the spinning of yarns and the weaving of fabrics was carried on in cities like Chios, Borea, and Miletus. These cities were then located in the most dry regions of the world, and their locations were chosen because the dry climate was suited to the spinning of yarns and the weaving of fabrics. The manufacture of yarns and fabrics was then carried out in the city, and the production of finished products was then exported to the inhabited areas of the world. There was no dry capital of the world in the days of the Romans. The Roman Empire was known as the ""Dry Empire"" because it included the most dry regions of the world. The Romans made this choice of locations because they considered it to be a good way to maintain the health of their soldiers. The citizens of the Roman Empire (both soldiers and civilians) were therefore encouraged to make use of the location of the city as a way of maintaining their health. As a result of this policy, the population of the Roman Empire grew very rapidly. The Roman Empire was made up of many different regions, and each of these regions had its own particular climate. As a result, it was not difficult for the Romans to maintain the health of the people in any particular region. The city of Rome was located in the most dry region of the Roman Empire, and so the city had a great deal of business. The city of Rome was the most important commercial center in the world at the time of Jesus. The city of Rome was a location that was very suitable for the manufacturing of yarns and fabrics, and it was also situated in the most dry region of the world. The city of Rome, then, was known as the ""Dry Capital of the World"", and it was the location of a great deal of the manufacturing of yarns and fabrics. For this reason, the city of Rome was chosen as the site of the temple of God. The temple of God was built on the site of the city of Rome. The location of the temple of God was chosen because it was a very dry location, and the dry climate was very suitable for the manufacturing of yarns","Westerville, OH was once known as ""The Dry Capital of the World"" due to being the home of the Anti-Saloon League, a driving force behind Prohibition in the early 1900s, and for its strict laws prohibiting sales of alcohol.

What is the difference between a fire fighter and a nurse?,"

A:

A fire fighter is someone who puts out fires and a nurse is someone who treats patients.
Fire fighters are a subset of emergency medical technicians (EMTs). EMTs put out fires, but also treat patients with injuries.
Nurses are a subset of medical technicians. Medical technicians provide medical care to patients, but are not doctors.

","A fire fighter is responsible for responding to emergencies that are mostly related to fires. A typical task would be to ride in a fire truck from the fire station to a home that has caught fire and use water and other fire-fighting tools to put it out. A nurse is responsible for providing medical care to patients, typically in healthcare facilities like hospitals, nursing homes and outpatient clinics. A typical task for a nurse would be to care for the wounds and help manage pain for a patient following surgery.",0.999841,0.999117,4.865374,0.98798,0.999853,1.770433,-6.401211738586426

In this author's humble opinion, pizza is the best food. And here's why. First, it's universality. While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite. There is a delicious amount of complexity in every bite: a crunch, warm, maybe a little spice, a little sweet",0.093976,0.975759,46.373918,0.975267,0.092213,9.702227,-7.668741703033447

A:

I would model this as a binary classifier. There are two types of people: Male and Female. You train a model on the training data, and then you use it to predict whether a new person is male or female. 
In this case, you might use some of the methods in scikit-learn. For example, here's a classifier that just uses maximum likelihood to make a decision.
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC, SVC
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn import cross_validation
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import numpy as np

# Load the data
data = load_boston()
X, y = data[:, 0:2], data[:, 2]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(X, y, 10)

# Build the classifier
clf = LinearSVC(kernel='linear', random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Return the model
model = clf.decision_function(X_test)

# Return the model's prediction
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print('Accuracy: %.2f' % accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Output:
# Accuracy: 0.966

I'm not going to show you how to classify people as male or female. I will say that there are ways to do this using machine learning, but they may not be the best way.

I just read the question in your comment. I think it's a slightly different problem. You have two types of people: Male and Female. Assuming that the underlying data is a binary classification problem, you can use","males:

Do pilots of civil aircraft know the exact weight of the aircraft prior to take-off?,"ine aircraft are certified to carry a certain amount of weight, and the operator must ensure that the aircraft in flight is within that weight limit.

If you've got the right materials, it can be done. But it's a lot more expensive than simply using the specifics of a drawing.

The first thing you'll want to do is find an airframe manufacturer that makes a model of your aircraft. The model should be exactly the same size as the real thing. This will make it easier for you to work out the approximate weight of the model.

Once you know the approximate weight of the model, you can then work out the weight of the real thing. This is done by using a simple formula:

• Theoretical weight = theoretical gross weight of the aircraft + load added to the aircraft.

• Actual weight = actual gross weight of the aircraft + weight added to the aircraft by the crew.

• Load is the amount of cargo carried plus fuel.

For example, if you have a Cessna 172, but the actual gross weight is 147,000 pounds, the gross weight is 147,000 pounds minus the weight of the cargo. This equals 147,000 pounds minus 23,000 pounds or 134,000 pounds. The actual weight is 134,000 pounds. This is the formula.

In this example, the load of 23,000 pounds is the amount of fuel that the aircraft can carry.

A popular aircraft is the Cessna 172. The weight of a Cessna 172 is approximately 147,000 pounds.

Here's the formula:

• Theoretical weight = 147,000 pounds + 23,000 pounds = 160,000 pounds

• Actual weight = 160,000 pounds – 23,000 pounds = 147,000 pounds

The weight of the model is approximately 147,000 pounds, which is the same as the actual weight of the aircraft.

The load of 23,000 pounds is the amount of fuel that the aircraft can carry.

It is important to note that the weight of the cargo must also be taken into account. The Cessna 172 has a gross weight of 147,000 pounds, but the cargo is only 23,000 pounds, so the weight of the aircraft is 160,000 pounds.

The load of 23,000 pounds is the amount of fuel that the aircraft can carry.

You may also want to take into consideration the weight of the pilot. If you","No, not the exact weight.

How to do forecasting with small dataset?," is a self-contained software package for doing forecasting with little data. However, one of the limitations of this software is its inability to output a forecasting graph. Unlike the current standard of forecasting methods (e.g. ARIMA, Holt-Winters), concupiscence does not require the user to create forecasting graphs. In fact, concupiscence has no such requirement. The main reason is that its forecasting graph is built in a way that allows it to be easily extended to extend to other types of data. The concupiscence is able to do this because concupiscence does not need to rely on any data preprocessing. Instead, it uses a Bayesian approach to forecasting. The concupiscence is able to make use of all the existing data without any data preprocessing. For instance, the concupiscence can be used to forecast the growth of the United States population by making use of the US census data. The concupiscence is able to make use of the time series data that is available in the US census. The concupiscence does not make use of the demographic data. Hence, the concupiscence is able to make use of the existing data without requiring any data preprocessing. 8

9 The concupiscence is able to forecast the growth of the United States population because it uses the historical data that is available in the US census. The concupiscence can also forecast the growth of the number of people by making use of the time series data that is available in the US census. The concupiscence does not require any data preprocessing. This makes the concupiscence more efficient than making use of the time series data that is available in the US census. The concupiscence is able to forecast the growth of the number of people in the United States because it does not require any data preprocessing. One of the reasons why the concupiscence is able to make use of the historical data that is available in the US census is because the concupiscence makes use of the time series data that is available in the US census.

Here are few approaches that can help you.

Simple moving average: This involves taking the average of a certain number of past data points, and using it as the forecast for the next period. This method can be effective for stable time series with no trend or seasonality.

Exponential smoothing: This method assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, with more recent observations being given more weight. This method can be effective for time series with trend and/or seasonality.

An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1).

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Adecco Group PLC (ADEC), the world's largest staffing, 
outsourcing and executive search firm, said it has been forced to hire staff 
to manage the transition from Enron Corp.'s (ENE) U.S. operations to the 
newly formed business.

Adecco said it plans to pay up to $500,000 to accommodate the higher level of 
customer service needed by employees working with the new business. 
Adecco is the only firm that has been hired to manage the transition of the 
employees in the Enron system. 
Adecco's parent company, Allied Domecq PLC (ADI), is also a client of Enron 
who has been working with the company to reorganize and restructure its 
operations as the company restructures its global business. 
As a result of the reorganization, Enron Corp. said it will be eliminating a 
number of jobs, including its vice president of human resources and 
director-level employee. 
Employees at the Texas-based company who have been with Enron since 1999 will 
become eligible for severance packages after 60 days, effective April 21, 
Enron said. 
These employees will also receive a base salary of $19,500 per year, a 
non-union 401(k) plan, a company-sponsored health insurance program, a 
life-insurance plan and a company-sponsored pension plan. 
The severance packages will be available to all employees who have lost their 
jobs as a result of the reorganization.

I'm considering buying a pocket knife for my child. How do I know which one I should buy?,"LOVE

The first thing you should do is look at the number of blades. I have a bad habit of buying a knife with only one blade. However, this is a knife that I have used so much that I am not going to change it. If you want a knife with many blades, buy a compact. If you want a knife with a lot of blades, buy a folding knife. The first one is always the most versatile.

The next thing you should do is look at the blade design. For example, if you are looking for a knife that will stay sharp, go with the knife with the least amount of rusting, not the knife with the most rusting.

The next thing you should do is look at the material from which the knife is made. Steel is a great material for a knife. The problem with steel is that all the knives are made from the same steel. The knife you buy today will not be as sharp as the knife you bought three years ago. It will also be more difficult to sharpen.

If you want a knife that you can use everyday, buy a knife that is made from stainless steel. Stainless steel is harder than steel, so it will take more time to sharpen. Most stainless knives are also made from steel.

The final thing you should do is look at the shape of the belly. There are many different types of knives. Therefore, you should find a knife that will fit your hand. If you have large hands, you may want to look for a knife with a short handle.

Before you buy the knife, find out how the knife is sharpened. Many knife sharpening services can sharpen your knife. If you let the sharpener use the knife, you will probably have a knife that is more expensive than the knife you bought. If you let the sharpener sharpen the knife, you will have a knife that will last for years.

Good luck!

What is a persona?,".

So, I’ve been thinking about myself and the other people who have been in this space for some time. I’ve lived in this space for a while, and I’m still learning and growing. I’ve got a lot of work to do.

But I’ve thought a lot about this, because it’s all these little things that are happening all the time. Just little things but that add up.

I’m now going to list some of the other people who have been in this space, and why.

It’s not an exhaustive list, but it’s a good start.

Some people are here because they’re the only ones who can do it, or they’re the only ones who are going to make it. There’s no other way. And they’ve found their own way to make it.

The second reason is that they’re here because they’ve got a skill, or they’ve got stuff to say, or they’re a voice they can give.

The third is that they’re here for a couple of reasons. One is the fact that they’ve got something to say. They’ve got something to say, and they don’t want to just talk about people.

They’ve got something to say that they can’t say, and they want to say it. And the other reason is that they’ve got something to say.

But this isn’t just about people. It’s about society and the state of the world. We need people to keep saying things. We need people to say them. We need people to tell us what to do, and we need people to tell us what we need to do.

We need to hear what’s going on.

The reason I’m going to list these people, and these are people who have stayed here for a while, is that they’re here because they’ve got something to say, and they’re here for a reason.

I think it’s fair to say that I’m one of those people.

I’m here because I’ve got something to say.

I’m here for a reason.

I’ve got something to say that I’ve been thinking about for a while.

I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.

What is the most famous sport in the world,". It's a long running joke that it was invented in the USA by a guy named William Miller, but that's as far as it goes. Much like baseball, the sport is relatively new, having been first played in England in 1844, and within two years of its birth in the US, it had spread to Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It's the only officially recognized sport that was invented by a foreigner, but that's not the only thing that makes it different to all of the other sports out there.

As the name implies, football is the most popular form of the game. It's also the most popular worldwide, with an estimated 200 million people playing the sport worldwide on a daily basis. It's a game played with a ball, made of leather and wool. It is very similar to soccer, but football is played on a larger scale, with a larger field, and a bigger ball.

The game is played by two teams that try to kick the ball into the opposing team's goal. The goal of the team is to score by kicking the ball through an opening in the goal. They do this by kicking the ball through a hole in the goal, usually using their feet.

There is also a goal that's called a try, and it is a goal that is only allowed to be kicked through. The try is usually thrown by the kicker, and it is the purpose of the try to score a goal. For the try to score a goal, the kicker needs to kick the ball through the goal.

The other popular team sport, soccer, is played in the same way as football, but with a different goal. It's a game that's played in many countries around the world. It's a game that is common in parts of Europe, Scandinavia, parts of Africa, and parts of the Middle East.

"Netflix views streaming video as a ""sustaining"" technology that extends its core mail DVD business. Do you agree with this, or do you think streaming video is a ""disruptive"" technology for Netflix that does not align with its core business and requires a different strategy?","al: I think Netflix does need to be more strategic. If you look at the streaming video market today, it's predominantly a kids' area. And even the older audience is slightly skewed toward the kids' area. So we are looking at a different business model. We're looking at the business model where we make the movie and television experience better. And that means that we need to be more strategic.

Cutting edge for Netflix?

Q: By cutting edge, are you talking about the development of streaming technology?

A: Kind of. In many cases, the best technology is already here. In other cases, it's a matter of innovation. We're always looking for new ways to help our customers. One of the things that you will hear about us is that we're a technology company that is not just about the technology, but about how to use the technology.

Q: What kind of technology are you talking about?

A: There are a lot of different technologies that we are looking at. For example, there are some new technologies that are based on video compression. The compression comes from industry standards. The compression is the core technology. We are looking for ways to use this technology better.

Q: You mentioned new technologies. What about video streaming lately?

A: I think the technology is there. I don't think it's going anywhere.

Q: Have you seen any upheavals in the industry, with regard to how the industry has changed?

A: I think that the industry has evolved a lot. There are a lot of new players. I think it's a great time to be in the entertainment industry.

Q: How does the Netflix experience differ from the other video streaming services?

A: Netflix has been around for a long time. We've built a great business, and we have a great product. When you look at the other services, such as Hulu and Netflix, they are not all that different. They're still offering the movie and television experience. We're offering a lot of extras. We have a lot of extras that differentiate us.

Q: You have launched a website that gives users the ability to stream movies and TV shows. Does that differentiate Netflix from the other video streaming services?

A: I think it's an absolutely positive thing. We have an incredible customer base. It's our goal to get our customer base to use more of the features that we offer","Netflix did a strategic renewal by cannibalizing its own cash cow business of mail-in-DVD services. This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform.

Give me a short bulleted list of the key points about the parallel universes in this passage.," parallel universes. First, one can either recall the point where the term parallel universes was first used in the English language by Alfred North Whitehead in his book Process and Reality, or one can recall the usage of the term in the Introduction to the first edition of the book, To the Science of the Universe, by Robert B. Laughlin and John C. Page. In any case, the term has been around a long time and has been used to describe a range of phenomena. The term is commonly used in physics, but it is also used in cosmology, where it is used to describe the idea that parallel universes can (and do) exist. In physics, the first instance of the idea of parallel universes was made by W. I. T. T. D. (William Irwin Thompson) in his General Theory of Relativity, published in 1916. D.

Fax: (312) 842-2582. www.press.uchicago.edu Second, the term has also been used in philosophy to refer to the idea that we can be justified in believing in parallel universes. The idea is that the belief that there are parallel universes is justified because the universe we occupy is a part of a larger universe. Third, the term has also been used to describe the idea that there are multiple versions of a single object, such as a person or a car. The idea is that multiple copies of the same object could be made, each with a different history and a different personality. Fourth, the term has also been used to describe the idea that there are multiple versions of a single event, such as the news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The idea is that the universe at large could contain a parallel universe in which the Kennedy assassination never happened. Fifth, the term has been used to describe the idea that there are multiple versions of a single person, such as the Beatles. The idea is that there are multiple versions of the same person, each with a different personality. Sixth, the term has also been used to describe the idea that there are multiple versions of a single event, such as the World Cup. The idea is that a single event can take place in multiple versions of reality.

- It is a hypothetical group of multiple universes which together are presumed to comprise  the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.

- It has been the subject of debates in cosmology, physics, and philosophy.

- Some argue that the ""parallel universes"" concept lacks testability and falsifiability, and so it is a more of a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis.",0.160804,0.992868,15.638093,0.991324,0.249944,3.606606,-3.485508918762207

Is there a difference between obsidian and stainless steel scalpels? There really doesn't have to be any difference. Both have to be sharp and have a cutting edge. If the scalpel is too dull, it's not going to cut very well, and you're going to have a hard time with the procedure.","Obsidian scalpels have a cutting edge that is many times sharper than a steel scalpel. In addition, obsidian scalpels have a smooth blade surface whereas all metal knifes have a jagged, irregular blade surface.",0.034664,0.999058,10.12552,0.985864,0.039035,2.436828,-4.010209560394287

Flink has multiple programming language implementations including Scala, Java, Python, and C++.

For example, the following extract from the Flink documentation for Scala indicates that C++ is not supported.

Note that the implementation of the Scala programming language has not been released yet, and therefore it may not be possible to use Scala in the absence of C++. The only currently supported Scala implementation is the Scala programming language itself.

And, from the Flink documentation for Java, we see that C++ is not supported:

Note that the implementation of the Java programming language has not been released yet, and therefore it may not be possible to use Java in the absence of C++. The only currently supported Java implementation is the Java programming language itself.

If you are writing code in Scala or Java, you should be able to run Flink in the absence of C++ or Java. However, if you wish to use any other programming language, you should be aware that Flink does not support that language.

I recommend using the following command to determine which programming languages Flink supports.

What is a job?

A job is a sequence of data, which you can think of as a ""line of data"" or ""job stream"".

In Flink, jobs are defined by the Flink API, which consists of a language called Kafka-friendly XML and the tools to perform queries on it.

A job can have a source, a sink, a processor, and a scheduler.

A source is used to generate data. A sink is used to consume data. A processor is used to perform computations on data. A scheduler is used to manage the execution of the jobs in the system.

The job source and sink can be a Flink DataSet.

A processor is a function that takes as input the job and produces as output a new job.

A scheduler is a function that takes as input a set of jobs and a set of job executions and decides which ones to execute.

If a job is not assigned a processor and a scheduler, it will be executed by default.

In Flink, jobs can be grouped into executors","Java, Scala, Python, SQL",0.000226,0.000385,19.318798,0.006093,0.000274,3.865155,-5.5106940269470215

Answers to these questions would obviously depend on the application. In a business application, for example, the answers would depend on the business rules that are to be applied to the dataset. The answers also depend on the tools used to manipulate the data.

In a database system, the question of normalization is closely related to that of the data model. The data model is the design of the tables and their fields. Normalization is the process of making the data model more efficient with the data. The data model is an abstraction of the data. The abstraction is achieved through the use of field names. The database is the physical implementation of the data model.

It's a simple question, but one that can be as difficult to answer as it is to ask. How much does your partner need to know about what you do for a living?

In the past, it was difficult to find out, but now you can use social networking to find out. You can even ask your friends and family to tell you what your partner should know about you.

But what about your child(ren)? How do you know how much they need to know?

Well, one of the best ways to answer that question is to think about what they will have to do as they grow. If they are going to be away from you on a regular basis, you should know where they are going and who they are going to meet.

It is also important to know what they will be doing at these times and what they will be wearing.

And what about the future?

It is not too soon to start discussing your children's future careers and goals. When they are young, they should be still be very much a part of you and your family life. But as they grow older, they should be getting involved in a wider range of activities.

This is the time to talk about what they will be studying and what they will be doing in the future. It is also a chance to discuss possible careers and to get them to think about and discuss their goals and ambitions.

And what about when they are older? What do they need to know about your partner?

When you are older, it is important to think about what is going to happen to you. This is the time to start thinking about your retirement. It is also a time to make plans for your children and grandchildren and to discuss with them how they will be able to contribute to the family finances.

Many people like to think of themselves as a team. This is a natural part of the human condition. But what happens if your partner has a different way of thinking and working?

Western
–
The West is a vast region in Western Europe, North America, and the Americas, which has an estimated population of over 7,800 million as of 2015. The term derives from Old English werð, meaning west or distant, the term also has a more technical and specific meaning, referring to the territory of a cultural grouping. The term is used primarily in English, and is occasionally used in some other European languages, including Welsh. The Western cultures have a long history, the oldest evidence of human presence in the Americas comes from the archaeological sites of Clovis culture. The Western culture has its roots in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the modern Western culture is known as the Western civilization, and is a result of the interaction of different cultures. The Western world was influenced by the Greek and Roman cultures of antiquity, in the 12th century, the Crusades and the Mongol invasion of Europe led to the founding of the first permanent Christian communities in the West. The Catholic Churchs dominance was consolidated in the 16th century, with the Protestant Reformation and the emergence of the European states in the 17th century, the Western culture was shaped by the influence of the British Empire, North American colonies, and French and Spanish colonial powers. The global impact of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially after World War II, has influenced the Western culture, the Western world has its roots in early Christianity, with the development of the Western canon in the late Middle Ages. Throughout most of Western history, the Western culture was defined by an ethic of Christianity, the term culture comes from the Latin word for a way of life. The Latin word for way of life, paideia, was borrowed by the Greeks from the language of the Ionian Greeks, pausanias, whose work On the Cities of Greece was written in the 4th century BC.

Why was the European Union founded?,"ation of the European coal

Thank you for visiting our website. We understand that you have many questions about the European Union. This website is designed to answer those questions and provide information about the European Union.

The European Union was founded in 1957 to deal with problems that affected the western regions of Europe. The initial agreement was that the European Coal and Steel Community would manage the industries of coal and steel. The countries of Western Europe had been able to have these industries since the end of the Second World War, but the costs of these industries were too high and the countries did not have enough of a surplus to make them self-sufficient.

In 1957, the members of the European Coal and Steel Community agreed to make the production of coal and steel under common rules and set limits on the number of mines and mills that could be built. The free movement of goods within Europe was also guaranteed. The European Coal and Steel Community was formed, although it was not legally recognized by the member nations. Throughout the 1960s, the European Coal and Steel Community was dismantled as the member nations began to develop their own industries.

In 1968, the European Economic Community was formed as a merger of the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community. This allowed the European Economic Community to receive aid from the United States, but also made it easier for the member nations to make their own decisions. In 1973, the European Economic Community was harmonized to become the European Union.

The European Union has grown to be a large union of 28 member nations. It has had many different names over the years. The name European Union was proposed by the French Prime Minister, Pierre Mendès France, in 1969. The name European Economic Community was proposed by the British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, in 1967. The name European Coal and Steel Community was proposed by the British Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, in 1948. The name European Economic Community was proposed by the British Prime Minister, Harold MacMillan, in 1961.

The European Union has three main goals: to promote peace, to promote economic growth, and to promote living standards. The member nations of the European Union have been able to make their own decisions about many different issues. The member nations of the European Union can also participate in different organizations. The European Union has been successful in many areas. In 1999, the European Union grew to be the largest trade bloc in the world. The European Union has also been successful in dealing with the Balkan crises.

The","The European Union was founded by Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherland in 1957. The goal of the European Union was to unite the national economies in Europe and to prevent future wars between the members states. To integrate the European economies further a single currency, the Euro, was introduced in 1999. Noways the European Union consists of 27 members, of which 20 have the Euro as official currency.",0.016752,0.991255,19.464016,0.972612,0.016686,4.292264,-3.833828926086426

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye,".

Bill Nye Explanation of the Fission Process

It’s a fact that the power of our sun is amazing. It emits as much energy as all of the world’s power plants combined. And the sun is the only star that can burn through its fuel in less than 12 years. This means that it burns up through its fuel so fast that it creates the heat energy that is essential to creating all of the energy that we need to live. When this happens, the sun releases its power through nuclear fusion, a process that creates the energy that is essential to making all of the energy that we need to live.

Now the sun is a big star, but the sun isn’t the only big star. Many of the stars that we see in the night sky are a little smaller than the sun, but they contain a lot more mass. Some of these stars have nearly the same mass as the sun, but most of them are much smaller.

As these smaller stars burn through their fuel, this releases the energy that is essential to creating the mass of the earth. When the sun is a big star, most of the mass that it releases is used to create the mass of the earth.

When the sun takes in enough mass to become a smaller star, it heats the mass of the earth so that it can fuse more. When the sun becomes a smaller star, it releases the energy that is essential to creating the mass of the earth.

The process of fusing the mass of the earth is called nuclear fusion and it releases a lot of energy. There are different types of nuclear fusion. One is called helium fusion, which is used to create the mass of the air in our atmosphere. There is also another type called hydrogen fusion, which is used to create the mass of the water in our oceans.

Nuclear fusion releases a lot of energy, but it also releases a lot of neutrons. These neutrons can be used to create new atoms. When a neutron is used to create a new atom, it creates a new element in the periodic table.

Before we learned about the periodic table, people thought that the only elements in the periodic table were the ones that were found in nature. But since the early 20th century, scientists have learned to create new elements in a controlled way by fusing atoms together.

When the sun begins to burn through its fuel and create mass, it releases a lot of neutrons. These neutrons","Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.099615,0.994257,17.914757,0.91972,0.090347,4.003739,-4.18160343170166

What are the best woods for smoking?

It depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a more flavorful smoke, you’ll want to go with an oak or hickory wood. If you’re looking for a smokier, more substantial smoke, you’ll want to go with white ash. Cherry, which is a softer wood, is a great smoking wood.

However, there’s another way to smoke…

When smoking, it’s important to note that you want your smoke to be cool, not hot. That means you should use a lighter to smoke rather than a bong or pipe. This makes it so you can hold your lighter for a long time, which will heat up the air until it’s hot. That’s not cool.

You can purchase a few different kinds of lighters, but you can also use a lighter that you’ve already purchased. All you need is a lighter and some lighter fluid, which is a type of fuel. Lighter fluid is lighter fluid mixed with a small amount of water. When you ignite the lighter fluid with the lighter, it will create a flame and heat the air.

I’ll be honest. I haven’t done this before. But I do know that I’ve smoked with a lighter before, and I love the way it makes the smoke. It makes it more intense and more flavorful.

What should we conserve electricity?," what we should conserve electricity?The main energy that we need for our daily lives is from the sun. It’s green energy. The sunlight is coming from the sun and the sunlight is charged with energy. And the energy of the sunlight is used to heat up the water and the water is used to heat up our homes. And the water is used to turn on our lights and the electricity is used to turn on our computers. And we use the electricity to run our cars. The cars are using the electricity to run their motors, the motors are using the electricity to run their engines, and the engines are using the electricity to run their motors. So the electricity is used to run everything.

This is our main source of energy. This is what we should conserve electricity for. Because the energy of the sunlight is not coming every day. It is not coming every day. It’s like a rain. It’s like a water. It’s like a water that is coming every day. But we have to conserve the energy of the sunlight because the sunlight is the main energy of the world and the sunlight is the main source of energy of the world. So we should conserve the energy of the sunlight.

Sometimes we should conserve the energy of the sunlight. We should conserve the energy of the sunlight when the sunlight is not coming. Because when the sunlight is not coming, the sunlight is not helping us. The sunlight is not helping us to be alive. The sunlight is not helping us to be healthy. The sunlight is not helping us to be happy. The sunlight is not helping us to be a good person. The sunlight is also not helping us to be a good husband, a good wife, a good parent, a good friend, a good son, a good daughter, a good son-in-law, a good daughter-in-law, a good friend-in-law, a good friend-in-law. You know, one of the main things that we should conserve electricity for is that we should conserve the energy of the sunlight. This is because the sunlight is the main source of energy of the world. And it’s used for everything. This is the main source of energy of the world.

This is the main source of energy of the world. That’s why we should conserve the energy of the sunlight. So this is what we should conserve electricity for. We should conserve the energy of the sunlight. What","When you conserve electricity you are actually helping the environment.

"From the passage provided, extract the name of the first female recipient of Turing award",". The gender of the first female recipient of the Turing Award must be extracted from the following passage:

“A woman who was a member of the President’s Council on Bioethics and was working on HIV/AIDS issues was in the room when Turing died” [1].

The way to extract the gender of the ‘woman’ is to use the adjacent word ‘was’. The ‘was’ is a preposition that indicates time. In the context, the ‘was’ is used to inform us that the woman was a ‘member of the President’s Council on Bioethics’. Therefore, we can extract the gender of the woman from the following passage:

“A woman who was a member of the President’s Council on Bioethics and was working on HIV/AIDS issues was in the room when Turing died” [1].

The Gender of the First Female Recipient of Turing Award

Now we have the gender of the first female recipient of the Turing award. Now we can ask whether it is a man or a woman. We can solve this question by retrieving the gender of the first male recipient of the Turing award.

Now we have the gender of the first female recipient of the Turing award. Now we can ask whether it is a man or a woman. We can solve this question by retrieving the gender of the first male recipient of the Turing award.

Solution

As the first female recipient of the Turing award is a woman, we can use the adjacent word ‘was’ in the passage to extract the gender of the first female recipient of the Turing award as follows:

“A woman who was a member of the President’s Council on Bioethics and was working on HIV/AIDS issues was in the room when Turing died” [1].

If we extract the first female recipient of the Turing award from the following passage, we can question whether the person is male or female as follows:

“A woman who was a member of the President’s Council on Bioethics and was working on HIV/AIDS issues was in the room when Turing died” [1].

In the passage, the word ‘was’ indicates time. In the context, the ‘was’ is used to inform us that the person was a ‘member of the President’s Council on Bioethics.

Summarize the main components of a Kubernetes cluster control plane from this paragraph,".

There is no single component that we are just going to focus on in this article. Kubernetes clusters are composed of nodes, each of which acts as an independent control plane. In other words, each control plane has the ability to act on its own. In Kubernetes, each control plane is called a *controller*. The controllers combine to form the *control plane*. A controller's responsibilities include orchestrating the control plane, providing a virtual network, managing the network load balancing and providing a virtual IP address for the entire cluster.

*Control plane* is a configuration management approach for deploying applications (e.g., microservices) in a cluster. For example, applications can be deployed using a single controller or multiple controllers. In a cluster where each controller is managing an independent cluster, the design is called *decentralized*.

A *decentralized control plane* allows you to deploy applications in an independent manner. In a cluster in which each controller is managing a cluster, the design is called *centralized control plane*.

The Kubernetes architecture is built on the control plane. It is composed of:

-   **Pods**: containers that can run applications. When a pod is created, it automatically creates a number of containers.

-   **Services**: pods that can run applications. When a service is created, it automatically creates a number of pods and containers.

-   **Replication controllers**: pods that can run a replicated application. When a replication controller is created, it automatically creates a number of pods and containers.

-   **Apps**: pods that are the source of traffic. When a pod is created, it automatically creates a number of pods.

-   **Cadvisor**: scheduler of pods. It is responsible for allocating resources.

-   **Rescheduler**: scheduler of pods. It is responsible for balancing requests and allocating resources.

-   **Kubelet**: rescheduler of pods in the node. It is responsible for scheduling pods in the node.

-   **Kubelet and kube-proxy**: rescheduler of pods. It is responsible for scheduling pods in the node.

-   **Kubelet and kube-proxy and kube-dns**: rescheduler of pods. It is responsible for scheduling pods in the node.

-   **Kubelet and kube-proxy and kube-dns and kube","The kubernetes cluster control plane runs on one more more master nodes. The components are:
1. etcd - a key value datastore containing the configuration data of the cluster.
2. The api-server is a server which serves and updates the state of the kubernetes cluster. It watches etcd and keeps the clusters actual state in sync with its desired state.
3. The scheduler is a component which selects on which node an unscheduled pod should run, based on what each pod needs and what the nodes in the cluster can support.
4. The controller manager manages several controllers which keep the cluster in sync with its desired state.",0.691901,0.997766,30.857144,0.994013,0.733161,6.854797,-7.598952770233154

A:

How to think about your self-talk

A:

When you begin to feel you are ""losing"" your mind, I would encourage you to take a step back and reflect on what you are thinking about in the moment.
Consider:

What are the thoughts that are running through your mind?
Are you focusing on those thoughts or are you engaging with the world around you?
What is your purpose in this moment?
What is your intention in this moment?

And if you're not sure of what to do, take a moment to write down the answer to each of those questions.  Then, write down another question to ask yourself:

What do I need to do to be happy?
What do I need to do to feel good about myself?
What do I need to do to feel good about my life?

Ask yourself those questions until they start to feel ""natural.""
Also, you can ask yourself:

Is this feeling in line with who I am and what I want?
If it is, do I need to change it?

If you're not sure of what to do, take a moment to write down the answer to each of those questions.  Then, write down another question to ask yourself:

What do I need to do to be happy?
What do I need to do to feel good about myself?
What do I need to do to feel good about my life?

Ask yourself those questions until they start to feel ""natural.""
Then, what you need to do is to find a way to let go of your self-talk.  How do I do that?  I think just by taking a moment to focus on your breathing and be in the moment.
Because when you are in the moment, you won't think about all of the things that are going on around you.  You are able to be in the moment because you are not trying to control it.

It became a cult hit when it was released and Strummer's post-punk band, The Fall, performed a cover version of the album's title track at their shows. The song's lyrics were about Strummer's time as a member of the band.

Strummer's work with Barefoot Nation was also productive. He contributed vocals and guitars to the band's 1999 album, The Last Good Day which was a departure from his usual style and sound. He also helped write and produce the band's 2002 album, Boombastic, which marked the start of a more experimental and experimental sound.

Strummer's political and social views have been well documented. He has been arrested on numerous occasions for his political activities, and has been known for his support of the Iraq War. He supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.

In 2009, Strummer toured the UK with The Fall and the Clash, and appeared on the main stage at Glastonbury Festival. He has also made cameo appearances in a number of films, most notably in The King's Speech and the biographical film, The Last King of Scotland.

Strummer has also released a solo album, Somebody's Gotta Change The World, in 2012. The album broke several Billboard charts, including the top ten, and reached number one on the US Heatseekers chart. He has also recorded with several other artists, including Suicide Machines and others.

Strummer has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, for his work with The Fall. He has also won a Brit Award for Best Live Act and four BPI British Albums Awards for his work with The Fall. He has been a member of the Brit Awards since the category was introduced in 1969. He has also been a member of the Brit Rock Awards since 2006.

Strummer has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1998 to 2004 as a Democrat, and in 2008 as a Republican.

"Given this paragraph about Chief Uncas, who was he?",", the father of Pocasset and Monadnock.

""On the other side of the Long Island Sound from Pocasset, where the Island is said to be, stands a hamlet called Monadnock, in which lived a man of a name now unknown, but of whom you have heard in these pages, a young man of noble spirit and excellent qualities, who was much beloved by the people of the place. Monadnock was rich in a great many natural productions, and was famous for his skill as a hunter. But, it happened that his life was passed in a state of great neglect, with only a few of his relations and friends. At length it came to his ears that the chief Uncas had sent word to his people to come to him, that he had a great mass of property in the Island, and that he would be very glad to see them there.

""Monadnock was persuaded by the words of his friend and cousin Uncas. He came to the Island, and saw the length of the land and the beauty of the dwellings, as well as the great abundance of poultry and other animals, and the rich meadows and fields. He was delighted with all, and was very well pleased with the place. But his heart was greatly affected by seeing a young man of noble qualities, who had been so long neglected and buried in obscurity. He therefore said to himself, 'It will be well to build a temple for him, and call him to be the chief of the Island; and this, in time, may be the means of his being raised into fame.' So he built a temple, and called him to be the chief. And this man was known to the people of the Island, by the name of the chief Pocasset.

""For a year or two he was very happy, and the people of the Island were very well pleased with him. But the time came when they began to be afraid of him. They feared that the chief was growing proud, and that he would get a great many followers, and that they would be obliged to send him away. But they were not ashamed to say so, because they had heard that the chief Uncas was already very rich, and had many followers. So they sent Uncas a message, saying, 'If the chief Pocasset has many followers, we would be glad to see them; but we will not send him away because we are afraid of his pride.'","Uncas (c. 1588 – c. 1683) was a sachem of the Mohegans who made the Mohegans the leading regional Indian tribe in lower Connecticut, through his alliance with the New England colonists against other Indian tribes.",0.563281,0.998761,15.994698,0.998025,0.532489,3.817451,-4.197230815887451

It wasn't until I started high school that I got friends. And the best part was, I became friends with girls. I didn't know that was possible back then.

I still don't have a lot of friends now, but I do have a few.

If I didn't have friends, I wouldn't have any friends at all.

I'm glad I have friends.

And I'm glad I'm friends with girls.

I was talking to a friend of mine on the phone the other day, and she told me about a guy she met online who was looking for a girlfriend. He asked her about what she went to school for, and she told him she was a junior. He said, ""Oh, you're an only child. You're very lucky.""

1. How a Carnivore Eats Its Food

The carnivore is the more efficient of the two. It has to be because carnivores have to be able to survive on their own, since they do not have to spend time feeding. Their digestive systems are designed to break down food into its basic components and then store those components for future use.

Herbivores, on the other hand, have to be able to eat a lot of food in order to survive. They have to find food when it's not available, and they have to store more food for future use.

The carnivore's digestive system is designed to break down food into its basic components and store them for future use.

What might seem like an obvious point isn't, however, because herbivores have to eat a lot of food in order to survive. So, they have to store food for future use. (Attention: This point is not discussed in the article. It is assumed that the reader has some knowledge of this point.)

Herbivores eat through a mouth, but their digestive system is designed to break down food into its basic components and store those components for future use.

And that makes sense to a carnivore because it is much easier to store food than it is to eat it.

The carnivore's digestive system is designed to break down food into its basic components and store them for future use.

When a carnivore eats, it has to eat a lot of food in order to survive. And it has to store much of that food for future use.

What might seem like an obvious point isn't, however, because herbivores have to eat a lot of food in order to survive. So, they have to store food for future use.
