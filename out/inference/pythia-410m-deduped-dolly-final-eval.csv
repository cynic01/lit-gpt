Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888; however, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky: from 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively.

What is a spatial network?,"A spatial network is a mathematical concept that represents the spatial structure of a network.  Spatial networks are commonly used in storefronts, cafés, shopping malls, hospitals, and universities.  They have the same structure as a physical network, but differ in how structures within the network are grouped together.  In a physical network, the nodes are connected by physical connections, whereas in a spatial network, the nodes are grouped together by their attributes.  Inter-node connections are allowed, but are not required.  An example of a spatial network is a parking garage network.  The spatial network has six structures, named Washington, Largo, North, South, Northwest, Central, and Post.  Another element of the spatial network is the type of connections.  A parking garage network has only one category of connections, which is horizontal street.","A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.",0.646328,0.998591,8.501406,0.705732,0.734549,2.317321,-4.464653015136719

"Extract the reasons why inverted yield curve could happen, and place them in a bullet list.","The inverted yield curve could happen when the world's power plants have to go through an extended period of refinery shutdowns.
There are several reasons that could cause an inverted yield curve to happen.  First, weather conditions can cause the refineries to shut down prematurely, which could cause a sudden drop in demand.  Second, the refineries might have to shut down unexpectedly.  A third factor is that demand might drop due to the shutdowns.
There are several steps you could take to mitigate the risks of an inverted yield curve.  First, you could consider temporarily lowering the price of gasoline.  Some of this may be done by switching to alternative fuels such as bioethanol, or natural gas.  You could also consider temporarily increasing the prices of electricity and natural gas.  This would depend on your needs.  If you need to go offline to do some work, for example, you could consider increasing prices for electricity and natural gas.  If you need to stay in the house, you could consider decreasing the prices of gasoline and natural gas.","There are two reasons why an inverted yield curve could happen
1. When investors think the economy will enter a recession in the near future, they will settle for lower yields associated with low-risk long-term debt, which would likely result in higher returns than investments in equities during the same time.

What is pan genomics?,"This work examines the potential to use DNA sequences as biomarkers for the identification of human diseases.

The current state of knowledge with regard to the use of nucleic acids as biomarkers is mainly based on the data gathered from several large, population-based studies. However, these studies have several limitations, including the use of various assays, the small sample size, and the use of a limited number of populations.

In recent years, many groups have been working to develop tests that can measure the presence of a single nucleic acid sequence in a sample, and to analyze the genetic and epigenetic changes that accompany that sequence. These tests have made significant progress, although the number of samples processed and analyzed using them is still small.

The advent of more complex assays has made it possible to analyze the sequence of a sequence, and to compare the sequence of a sequence that is unique from that sequence with the sequence of a sequence that is already known. This has provided an important tool for the identification of rare diseases, for which no tests have been available for many years.

The most extensive analysis of the genome has been carried out using a process called next-generation sequencing. This method, which has been mostly developed for the purpose of medical research and basic research, has made considerable progress in understanding the genomes of many human diseases, and to the identification of novel genes and their products.

The development of next-generation sequencing has led to the development of a number of assays that analyze the sequences of nucleic acids to allow the identification of rare diseases.

The original purpose of these tests was to provide a means of rapid diagnosis of diseases, with which the patient could be referred to the medical service.

The advent of next-generation sequencing has made it possible to analyze large numbers of sequences simultaneously. This has made it possible to study the sequence of a sequence, and to compare it with that of a sequence that is known, and to study the gene structure that underlies the sequence of a sequence.

The development of next-generation sequencing has also made it possible to study the sequence of a sequence, and to study the change that accompanies this sequence.

Newer technologies have made it possible to analyze the sequence of a sequence, and to study the change that accompanies that sequence.

The most extensive analysis of the genome has been made using the next-generation sequencing technology called next-generation high-throughput sequencing. This method has made it possible to analyze a large number of sequences simultaneously, and to study the sequence of","Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini which eventually took root in bioinformatics. Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular taxonomic group: although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum, etc. It is divided in two parts- The Core genome: Set of genes common to all the genomes under study (These are often housekeeping genes vital for survival) and The Dispensable/Flexible Genome: Set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study.

Which is better - skiing or snowboarding,"Skiing is better, as it requires a lot of skill, experience, and equipment.","I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis.

What is Acyl-CoA?,"An acyl-coa methyl ester (acyl-coa, also acetyl-coa, and acetyl-CoA) is a hydrocarbon product derived from the oxidation of fatty acid. Since the early 20th century, acyl-CoA has been used in the field of biochemistry as an example of a molecule that possesses an unusual sequence of properties. The acyl-CoA is a central carbon-based amino acid. An anionic phosphatidylcholine (anionic PC) head group, the so-called anionic head group, binds to the anionic acyl-CoA, thus forming a tunnel. This anionic head group binds to a negatively charged phospholipid, and a negatively charged phospholipid-bound anionic head group forms a phospholipid-bound anionic head group. The anionic head group forms a hydrocarbon chain, the so-called anionic chain, that is linked to the anionic head group.

In the anionic head group, a chain is formed from the anionic head group, the anionic chain, and an anionic hydrocarbon chain. The anionic head group forms a ring of carbon atoms, the anionic chain, and a chain. The anionic head group is generally a hydrocarbon chain, the so-called anionic chain, the anionic chain, the anionic chain, and the anionic head group. The anionic head group contains a phosphate group at the C4 position, and the anionic chain contains a phosphate group at the C2 position. The anionic chain contains a phosphate group that is attached to the anionic head group, and a chain that is attached to the anionic head group.

The anionic head group and the anionic chain are linked via an acyl group, which is attached at the C5 position. The anionic head group contains a chain that contains a phosphate group attached to the C4 position, the anionic chain contains a chain that contains a phosphate group attached to the C2 position, the anionic head group and the anionic chain are linked via a terminal non-ester group. The anionic head group and the anionic chain are linked via a phosphate group, a chain that contains a phosphate group attached to the C3 position. The anionic head group and the anionic chain are linked via a chain that includes a more fatty acid, the anionic chain. The anionic head group and the anionic chain are linked via a chain that includes a fatty acid other than an anionic fatty acid.

the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

But why should business leaders steward the market? Private managers hold a moral obligation to 
those relying on capitalism for work and health insurance to create sustainable jobs. As individuals count on business leaders to respond to our world’s most prevalent issues, business leaders also hold a social obligation to do so with",0.874091,0.996398,4.613638,0.570729,0.862403,1.583452,-3.800132989883423

2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.

What common errors should you watch for?","Lift weights before and after the assessment, and observe both women's performance. Additionally, be sure to measure her arm strength, hip strength, and the waist and thigh of her to ensure that her exercises are optimized for all women.

Each woman’s exercises should be measured for her strength, body composition, and hypertrophy goals. Specifically, for each woman, we will focus on her top body parts for hypertrophy.

For example, if one of the women’s exercises is strength training, we want to see if both of them are able to perform at least 30% of the target strength. The women in this example have both been trained to lift weights, and as such, we would expect both to be able to perform at least 30% of the target strength. In addition, if one of the exercises is bodybuilding, we would expect both women to be able to perform at least 80% of the target bodyfat.","For Vanessa, we’ll choose for her to perform a one-rep max assessment, specifically with the bench press.

"In football, if touchdowns is the main way to get points, why can't the quarterback always throw the ball to the end zone every time?","There are some scenarios where the completion of the football is the most important part to getting the win. The first scenario is when the quarterback is not the playmaker, and they have to make a play to get the ball to the end zone. The second scenario is when the defense has the football, and they have to stop the run/pass. The last scenario is when the defense creates turnovers, and the offense has to stop the turnovers.","To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. 
At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard.",0.94898,0.99482,3.7578,0.502046,0.947486,1.430226,-2.866259813308716

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration.

Summarize Romania's history and founding.,"Rochesters first settlement in the region dates back to the Paleolithic era. It is thought that the first humans appeared in present day Romania in the form of Australopithecines (Neandertals) around 4,000 years ago, though this is highly disputed.

The Romanians developed a nation-state in the 5th century BCE. They started with a monastery-like religion, with a priest and his own priesthood, and then adopted the Roman name, which means Latinized Rondonian in Romanian. It is considered that the first Romanians settled in the region around 5,000 years ago.

What causes global warming?,"Global warming is an increase in average surface temperature over time. There are two possible scenarios for this development. 
1. The Earth warms due to increased atmospheric pressure and temperature. 

2. Increased atmospheric pressure and temperature result from a feedback from the Sun. The Sun warms the upper atmosphere, as well as the lower atmosphere, and some of the gases in the upper atmosphere react to increase the surface temperature. This feedback can be observed by the atmospheric patterns in the infrared, which are caused by increased temperature.

3. Increased atmospheric pressure and temperature result from increased sea levels. The oceans rise and the water vapor in the air rises in the atmosphere. 
4. Additional aerosols are released. Gravity causes atmospheric aerosols to rise, and more aerosols are released.","Global warming is caused by the release of greenhouses gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere trap the heat from the sun and lead to an overall increase in temperature on the planet. Greenhouse gases are mostly produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Deforestation is also a contributing factor to global warming since trees capture carbon from the atmosphere when growing, so cutting them down or burning them both releases carbon they’ve been storing, as well as removes their ability to clean the air.",0.85844,0.9968,10.356788,0.876807,0.869127,2.791592,-5.744983196258545
"my health insurance covers preventative procedures like vaccines 100%. But I know some health care providers charge a ""visit fee"" in addition to the vaccine fee. What's the difference between getting a vaccine in a clinic and a pharmacy? Will getting a vaccine in a clinic (such as minute clinics) result in charges?","It depends on the type of the provider and the type of the procedure. In clinics, the charges for vaccines range from $20 to $30. In general, the more expensive the procedure the more expensive the cost of vaccination. The ""visit fee"" is a cost for the doctor to see you before the procedure.
The ""visit fee"" is usually for a single visit.","The main difference between getting a vaccine at a clinic and a pharmacy comes down to the setting and the potential fees involved.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.
A pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.

Fees:
Both clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.

Describe how skateboarding teaches you about life and to be resilient.,"People in skateboarding take life as they find it, which is how they learn to be resilient.  One of the things that skateboarding teaches is to be resilient.  In fact, most people learn to be resilient through skateboarding.  One of the biggest misconceptions about skateboarding is that it is a straightjacket.  Instead, you learn to be resilient through skateboarding as you learn to be resilient to life in general.  The most important thing about skateboarding is the freedom it gives you to be yourself and not be constrained by the rules of the game.  Another huge aspect of skateboarding is that you get to make a point of spending time with people who are different.  Which is why you find that some people are more resilient than they would otherwise be.  This is because they have an understanding of how life works and they are willing to put themselves in danger to save other people.  Whether it is riding a skateboard, putting themselves in a car accident, or even just trying to get to an ice rink, you are learning to be resilient because you are willing to put yourself in dangerous situations.","Skateboarding has been through quite an evolution since its first inception, when it came from the waves to the street. As a sport, skateboarding has always had a special attitude towards rules and pushed boundaries. Think of where one is supposed to skate (in the park) and where the best spots can actually be found across town (particularly where it's forbidden). In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved. As humbling and painful as falling onto plain asphalt can be, it can also stimulate resilience and a relieving patience when the goal is in sight. Just try again.",0.457347,0.998663,9.969143,0.87389,0.54539,2.568886,-3.226942777633667

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

In the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity.

What is the key to longevity?,"The key to longevity is to be able to sustain your positive mindset over a prolonged period of time. For this to happen, you must have a reliable source of energy and food that provides you with the necessary nutrients, and close by you, an environment that sustains you as you age.","Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. 
Researchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of.

Why is film photography popular again?,"The popularity of film photography has a long history, dating back to the 1800s. The film camera was a way to document the movements of nature in a way that was not possible with remotely available digital cameras. In the 20th century, film photography started to be used to record the sights and sounds of everyday life, and to document the human condition. The popularity of film photography has continued to grow in the 21st century, as more and more people are realizing the value of photography as a form of entertainment, education, and community.","Film photography had seen a long decline in popularity ever since the invention of digital cameras with their remarkable leaps in technological advances. As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in",0.917229,0.995846,3.970706,0.675263,0.926711,1.497151,-2.806623935699463

The insides is the soft, pliable, non-intact part of the brain.","As kids grow and have a sense of the world around them, they tend to be eager to understand the meaning of everything and events.

What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a large, well-characterized, genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted with thousands of participants for a single gene or a single cell.

The genome-wide scanning method is a genome-wide method of genetic association study, which involves large numbers of individuals, usually from multiple populations. The method is based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The individuals from the population are genotyped and the genotype data are used to identify the common genetic variants, which are called heritraps. Many statistical algorithms can be developed for the identification of common genetic variants using the heritraps.

The population from which the heritraps are selected is called the heritraper population. The heritraper population consists of the heritraper individuals who are the heritraper parents. The heritraper parents have the same common genetic variant as the heritraper population, and the heritraper offspring have the same common genetic variants. The heritraper heritraper population is a heritraper population which is selected from the heritraper heritraper parents.

The heritraper heritraper population is typically composed of the heritraper parents, the heritraper heritraper parents', and heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper theheritraper heritraper heritraper heritraper theheritraper heritraper theheritraper heritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper theheritraper the","In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.",0.011848,0.976349,4.915657,0.756845,0.011769,1.334494,-2.9081878662109375

Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?,"No, learning on a keyboard is not just as effective on a grand or upright piano as learning on a keyboard.  There are significant differences between the two, the main one being the size of the keyboard.  On a keyboard, the keys are closer together allowing the fingers to more easily interact with each other.  On a grand piano, the keys are closer apart and thus the fingers and brain have more space to create more complex movements.  I find it helps to have a ""leader"" or two of the keyboard(s) as opposed to the pianist, and these can be a keyboard up or down or have different pitch or key signatures.  Keyboards are usually smaller and therefore have a lower profile than grand pianos.","Since the layout of keys for both electronic keyboards and pianos are the same, keyboards could be effective for beginners. However, Pianos have more “action” than keyboards (i.e. how the keys feel when pushed down, whether they are light or heavy).  So learning on a keyboard may not prepare a person for the heavier feeling of piano keys. If a piano is too costly or large, another option is learning on a keyboard with weighted keys that feel much more similar to a piano.",0.657612,0.999441,5.992381,0.449913,0.663843,1.752638,-4.201266288757324

Because the atmosphere is a fluid that moves around the earth, atmospheric rivers are found in many different locations ranging from the most northerly regions to the farthest distant areas.","Atmospheric rivers are relatively long, narrow regions in the atmosphere – like rivers in the sky – that transport most of the water vapor outside of the tropics. These columns of vapor move with the weather, carrying an amount of water vapor roughly equivalent to the average flow of water at the mouth of the Mississippi River. When the atmospheric rivers make landfall, they often release this water vapor in the form of rain or snow.",0.948457,0.997374,2.993122,0.736658,0.944468,1.324016,-2.933004856109619

Many cultures enjoy eating dinner late at night. Many young people prefer to eat at night so that they can enjoy the company of friends and a drink at night. Typically, only elderly people and small children eat dinner at an earlier time. I prefer to eat dinner early because most of the best restaurants have open reservations at 5:00 pm, so I can almost always get a good table. I'm not particularly eager to eat late in the evening because then I have a hard time sleeping at night. I prefer to have dinner at 5:00 pm because it starts the evening earlier, forces you to leave work and allows you to spend the whole evening with your friends and family.

Why do we have car registrations,"Given the exponential growth in the number of car registrations on the roads, it is logical that we should have a centralized database of car registration records.  A single central database that can store all of the car registration data would be a boon to both users and car manufacturers. 
The problem with this approach is that it is extremely difficult to find the most accurate information.  It is also difficult to enforce a model of perfect security.  
In terms of security, it would be much more secure if we had a database that was completely encrypted on the backend.  If a user were to lose their account they would have no way to access any of the data.","Car registrations are a yearly mandatory registration for all operable cars that drive on public roads.  Its a way to keep track of the number of cars on the roads and to also collect taxes from people who drive on public roads for public road maintenance and repair.

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"Georgia is home to many great independent and foreign-language films. Though these films tend to be low-budget, often with limited local distribution, they have a large following in the US.","While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

Second, vary the lighting conditions. Revisit your familiar photo spots at different hours - during the sunrise, sunset, at noon, in pitch darkness and of course, during the golden hours when the world around you embraces that warm glow.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

Explain the best way to swing a golf iron compared to a golf driver.,"The power output from a golf iron is greater than that of a golf driver. Golfers swing more easily with a golf iron than with a golf driver. A golf driver is often in use for both playing and hitting. Golfers swing with a golf driver because it's easier to reach the ball with the grip on the inside of the grip. A golf iron is typically used for hitting the ball from a position away from the body, away from the opponents line and away from the line of fire. Golfers swing with their hands more than with a golf driver. One difference is the grip on the inside of the grip is wider and more comfortable. Golfers who swing a golf iron have to unscrew the wood from the shaft, and then put the wood back together. As a result, the grip on the inside of the grip is wider. This wider grip allows the driver to be more effective to hit the ball from farther away, away from the opponents line and away from the line of fire. A golf driver is typically used with a driver. Golfers swing with their right hand, while the left hand is used for hitting the ball.","When hitting an iron you want to make a downward striking motion in the grass.

What and how should you feed your baby?,"Firstly, you should ensure that your baby is in the right position.  Examine your baby.  Pay attention to his head and ears.  Look at your baby's body and neck.  Also, check to see if the baby is ""full"".  If he is fully in, you want to feed him, but if he is ""full"", feed him slowly.  Eat plenty of food immediately after feeding the baby.  Eat enough food so that your baby is full, but not so much that the food is running down the baby's throat.  Eat enough of the food so that the baby's stomach is full and not full enough.  Eat enough of the food so that your baby is hungry enough to want to eat more of it.

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding.

"Given the following paragraph on cell structure, what is an example of membrane proteins?","The following paragraph on membrane proteins describes an example of a membrane protein:

A protein or a protein complex usually consists of proteins, a membrane, and a soluble or insoluble functional entity that is located in the membrane, such as a membrane protein. Protein complexes are generally identified by the presence of a signature sequence, which is a sequence that can be recognized or sequenced by antibodies, enzymes, or other chemical or physical methods. The sequences of proteins and protein complexes are generally referred to as protein sequences. Proteins and protein complexes can be isolated from their membrane-enclosed environment and purified.

In addition, in recent years, there has been increased interest in the structural determination of membrane proteins. Membrane proteins can be solved by several different methods, including experimental crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and liquid chromatography (LC). NMR spectroscopy of membrane proteins has been used to obtain structural information on membrane proteins that include structure elucidation of the membrane protein as well as the location of its components. NMR studies of membrane proteins have also provided atomic resolution structural data; these include the structure of the membrane proteins and the components.

Structural determination of membrane proteins is a powerful method for understanding their structure and function, and for designing new tools for the structural analysis of membrane proteins.",One example of membrane proteins are integral membrane proteins which go across the membrane and serve as membrane transporters.,0.667308,0.998084,8.86397,0.866869,0.788666,2.43698,-4.503929615020752

What is hybrid working?,"Hybrid working is a process that allows two computing devices to work together, but with only the processor (host) of the device that's been directly connected to the internet.  The other devices (clients) are connected to the internet and are able to communicate back and forth with the host.  Hybrid working can be an effective and cost effective solution for some workloads, but it has significant drawbacks.

The main drawback is that the processing of the hybrid devices can be slow, due to the delay between the requests coming in and the responses being sent back to the clients.  This can lead to lagging, data errors, and other types of slow performance issues.  

Another drawback is that the hybrid devices may not use the power of the computing device that is being used for the hybrid.  The management of the hybrid device can be very complex due to the need for multiple servers (often called 'load balancers') that are responsible for managing the load between the client and the server that's hosting the hybrid devices.  This can add significant load to the server and can cause performance problems.  

Hybrid devices can also be very expensive, as they use either software or hardware components that are relatively more expensive than the operating systems that are being used to manage the computing device, and therefore are expensive to maintain.","Hybrid working is a term used for when you split your work time between an office building and from other locations, usually home.

Kia Carnival faces an uphill battle against the industry leader to gain market share. Kia Carnival can perform a small, low-cost experiment to measure consumer outcomes, customer value, and attribution to increase sales and optimize its spending on digital marketing.   

The minivan buyers typically visit the Kia Carnival website, engage in a vehicle build configurator, and perform inventory checks to get an overview of the vehicle and price. Post this, the buyers will check YouTube videos and Twitter reviews and visit a Kia dealership store if the buyer shortlists Carnival.   

Kia can start measuring the micro-conversions along the buyer journey by tracking the website page views; car configuration clicks, inventory views, and video views on the Kia YouTube channel. These data points",0.521186,0.999008,0.999196,0.941284,0.562225,0.80458,-5.519006729125977
Why do so many people say it is special to be a grandparent?,"Because it is so important to us, we want to be a part of the process. This is so important because it is a good way to connect with our children.  If they can see us, they can relate to us and we can help them see their friends and family.  Our grandpa knows them and is able to see their problems and happiness.  This is a great way to help them and their children grow as a family.  We want to continue to be a part of this great process and in turn, we can help many more generations to come.","Many people say that being a grandparent is special.  They say it is special being a grandparent for a variety of reasons.  One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, ""I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.""  Having this love for another is a key factor in why it is special to be a grandparent.",0.743031,0.998303,4.42664,0.979226,0.779721,1.585384,-3.3751630783081055

Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner’s and other faults and chose to",0.940461,0.960141,4.390565,0.785719,0.929781,1.601333,-5.7591047286987305

What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?,"Left and right side of the brain are often used interchangeably, but they have different functions and roles. The right side of the brain is primarily involved in spatial cognition and is responsible for motor control. The left side of the brain is used to perform cognitive tasks, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, and is responsible for emotions and emotions in general.","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.901968,0.997529,2.991125,0.069565,0.891287,1.170295,-2.665780782699585
What is a bond in finance?,"A bond is a general-purpose financial instrument, allowing a borrower to borrow money at a fixed yield without the need for a loan.","In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stock",0.934766,0.987038,0.998523,0.141055,0.925244,0.797325,-2.815528154373169
How can a football training session be planned?,"A football training session can be planned, either on-going or on-futures. Given the nature of the game, a three-day long training session is sufficient. A four-day session may include two off-weekly sessions, one Saturday and one Sunday. The individual sessions are usually 30-60 minutes long and the individual sessions typically last from one hour to two hours. One weekend session may consist of two or four 45 minute long sessions.","First of all, the team has to change and put on the football clothes. Depending on the weather conditions, the right football shoes also have to be put on. Rubber nubs or steel studs can be used. It is better to wear indoor shoes in the hall and short nubs on the hard court. The first step is to warm up during training. Then stretch to prepare the muscles for fast movements. Afterwards, passing and shooting exercises are rehearsed. At the end, a small game should take place to keep it fun.

Does a difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups from a credit scoring algorithm constitute a bias in the data collection process or the algorithm itself?,"A credit scoring algorithm, in the credit scoring industry, can be seen to be biased in its ability to identify a specific characteristic of an individual based on the data it generates. When conducting credit scoring research, a credit score algorithm will use data to determine whether a credit worthiness or credit worthiness based on a person's credit worthiness is similar to that of another person. Because credit scoring algorithms are not trained on the same data, they will likely use the same set of rules to identify in which of the two persons the credit worthiness is similar to their own.

A credit scoring algorithm will, therefore, likely show a greater ability to identify in which of the two ethnic/gender groups the creditworthiness of an individual is similar to it than the algorithm will in the first instance.","I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in",0.317977,0.999387,3.978444,0.720845,0.358772,1.275085,-3.5133376121520996

How can I help a homeless person?,"Just because you're homeless doesn't mean you can't help a homeless person. And even if you don't have a degree in psychology, there are a number of things you can do. 

In some cities, you can help by setting up a table and donating food or money. In other cities, you can help by setting up a table, and donating money.

For example, in a city like New York City, the city government has a table and a phone to call homeless people.  

If you're homeless, and you're looking for a place to stay during the day, try to find a coffee shop or diner that has a table. Then, you can call the number on the menu, place order for food, and get a table.  If the host is a regular, they might be able to give you a table at a discount.

If you're homeless and you want to help the homeless people, try to avoid large groups.  If you want to be helpful, avoid loud music and parties.

If the host is not interested, don't do anything.  If you are really interested, talk to them about their situation, and find a way to help.","There are lots of ways you can help a homeless person.

How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?,"There are a number of musical theories that are commonly stated in the popular music repertoire, including Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and Bach.  The Bach theory is based on the theory of the development of choral music, and has been the most successful in popular music education.","Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

Electric locomotives use electricity from overhead wires to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, making them lighter, faster, and quieter than steam or diesel engines.


How Does a Diesel Locomotive Work:
Diesel-electric locomotives provide cheaper upfront costs and improved reliability.

Train wheels are conical, allowing them to travel a longer distance while turning at the same speed as the inner wheel. The wheel on the left is positioned further out from the center of the axle than the right, which is beneficial for stability and comfort of the passengers. Railways have wide curves due to the ""flange"" of the wheel limiting lateral movement.

What are the reasons why quantum theory is considered do difficult to understand,"The theory is believed to be an extremely deep and complex mathematical concept that has enormous implications in physics, chemistry, biology, and many other areas of modern science.  

It is not clear to what degree this is true.  The most logical and compelling explanation is that the theory was developed by a group of scientists struggling to solve the Impossible Problem.  

However, it seems unlikely that the theory was developed solely to solve the problem of global cooling.  It is clear that the theory can be applied to many other areas of science. For example, it has been used to explain the mysterious structure of the human heart.  

Another reason is that the theory is based on a mathematical framework closely linked to the structure of the human brain.  

The link between the human brain and the mind is an extremely complex network of connections.  

This theory is thus difficult to understand.","1. There is not one agreed set of basic rules (axioms) that underpin the theory and each has subtle implications on how you interpret the theory
2. For each of those there are multiple views and mathematical frameworks for describing the theory (e.g. the wave mechanics, field theories, etc)
3. The mathematical theories are all at an advanced level and few examples of how to actually apply them appear in text books.
4. The theory itself says that you cannot know the intermediate steps in any quantum process, you can know where you start and predict where you might end up but not how you get form one to the other.
5. The theory is based on either infinitely parallel actions occurring deterministically or statistical interpretation of a range of outcomes

What is TIDB,"TIDB stands for time-dependent integration and time-dependent memory. The term ""time-dependent"" refers to how data is persisted across different periods of time. The time-dependent nature of the data means that the information is ""stored"" in the ""timestamps"" that are created by the database management system. The data is ""stored"" in the database either as a single row of data with the header ""timestamp"", or as a collection of rows, each row containing a series of columns with the date, time, and other metadata which is used to track changes of the data seen (e.g. when data is inserted, updated, or deleted in the database). TIDB is typically used in a relational database to store a single collection of rows of data with a timestamp, and a single column for time data.

TIDB is a key feature of a relational database management system. In a relational system, information is typically persisted across time. This means that the database management system can optimize the use of space, improve performance, and provide a high degree of backward compatibility over time. When the time periods are separated, they are also referred to as ""time-related transactions"" or ""time-related transactions"". TIDB allows the management of an application's data in a manner that is consistent across time.

An example of TIDB is in the relational database management system Oracle Database. Oracle Database provides a TIDB feature that makes it possible to implement a TIDB system for Oracle. The TIDB features provided by Oracle Database include:

Time-Dependent Indexes - Group rows that have the same ""timestamp"" by time period and have the same number of ""index"" columns, based on the relationship between the ""timestamp"" column and the ""time period"" column.
Tag-Based Indexes - Group rows with the same ""timestamp"" column but with different ""time period"" column, based on the relationship between the ""timestamp"" column and the ""time period"" column.
Temporary Indexes - Group rows with the same ""timestamp"" column but with different ""timestamps"" (e.g. when ""time periods"" are removed, ""timestamps"" are updated).

The TIDB features provided by Oracle Database are supported in Oracle Database 10g, and Oracle Database 11g.",Database developed by PingCap for hybrid transactional and analytical processing,0.540663,0.998997,15.879307,0.987352,0.619738,3.805211,-4.070776462554932

Is the Cordyceps fungus from The Last of US real?,"The last of US real? It is not.

However, this was not the correct name of the fungus, as the name ""dendronoma"" was suggested by another German author, and the fungus was named after the endophytic fungus that grows as a resting colony of a plant in the bark of a tree. The new name is ""fungus of the tree"". However, the fungus that grows as a resting colony of a tree in the form of a sporophyte was named after a plant, rather than a tree.","Yes, Cordyceps is a real fungus naturally occurring in nature.

How do you explain cloud computing to a 5 year old?,"First you should have a baseline understanding of cloud computing and how it differs from traditional computing. A person who is 5 years old should understand that cloud computing is an idea that is still evolving. The core idea is that in the future, the cloud can store, process, and share data that are in the form of data, files, and other kinds of information. This data, also known as ""cloud computing"" can be stored in virtualized clouds or public clouds and accessed from any device. This data can be accessed by the cloud and can be done in real-time. So, today, different companies are starting to do this type of cloud computing, and they are using virtualized clouds to store data. The data can be accessed in real-time, and it can be done from any device on the network. This new model of cloud computing is called ""HA"" or ""Hadoop"" because it allows you to do all the work with just a few data files. This model of cloud computing is also called ""Hadoop Hadoop"" because it allows you to do a very simple job, which is reading data from a file, and you can do it in real-time.  You can do it from any device on the network.  You can also do it with a computer that is connected to the internet and you can do this both on-premise and off-premise.",Imagine you are building some thing using lego pieces. All of your legos are in basket.  As you start to build your desired structure you start to take 1-3 or couple of handful of legos from the basket. As you start to give some shape to the structure you are designing you start to put back some of the legos into the basket you don't need. Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket). As your application needs compute resources to meet the demand; you borrow compute resources from the cloud providers data center and give it back when you don't need it.,0.452796,0.9983,10.875807,0.829744,0.49883,2.731095,-2.9298205375671387

2. “Everything is possible for the mind. And no one can control it. Life is not about reaching the goal, it’s about achieving the most of what is possible in the widest possible vision. The mind will always find a way.” 
3. “Therefore, what is great should be also free of dross, for it is life that gives birth to all religions, and the world is full of dross. And whatever we see is a result of ignorance. Therefore, try to control your mind and lead it in the right direction. And foremost of all, know that there is no superior path than the one which can be followed by everyone.”

All beings are destined to attain the highest state of consciousness. Therefore, enjoy your life and happiness, for it is the incomparable gift of this world. 
5. “There is no dharmataka, neither there is a greater dharmataka. There is only the indivisible light, free from all attachments and imperfections.” 
6. “Do not dwell on anything, but only on what is happening now. And always remember, “the way is clear.” So calm yourself, and move on.

Be grateful for all that has been, for it is the best ever.”

Explain gravity,"Gravity is defined as ""the intrinsic property of objects such as planets, stars, and planets that makes them move relative to the observer"".  Gravity is a force that causes objects in the universe to move in a circular motion, unless acted upon.  If something is acted upon by gravity, then it will fall inwards, and as the object is ""inwards"", it will continue to move in a circular motion.

In general relativity, gravity is ""the property of objects that makes them move in one of two mutually perpendicular directions"" and is responsible for the motion of objects around the Earth.

The gravitational force is responsible for the attraction of objects in a vacuum to each other.

In general relativity, gravity is ""the property of objects that makes them move in one of two mutually perpendicular directions"".  

According to the laws of physics, objects that move in one mutually perpendicular direction are attracted to each other.

This causes objects in the universe to move in a circular motion.

However, objects that move in a mutually perpendicular direction are not attracted to each other.

The circular motion of objects in an expanding universe is called a ""circular motion"".

In a gravitational field, objects that move in a mutually perpendicular direction are ""accelerated"".

This causes objects to move in a circular motion.

However, objects that move in a mutually perpendicular direction are not ""accelerated"".

The gravitational force is responsible for the attraction of objects in a gravitational field.

In general relativity, gravity is ""The intrinsic nature of the gravitational field causes objects to move in mutually perpendicular directions"".

The gravitational force is ""The intrinsic nature of the gravitational field","Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.928187,0.989469,23.305534,0.993382,0.928898,5.429094,-5.759929180145264

Which component of a PV solar system implements MPPT?,"PV solar arrays are typically made from metal and include a front face (or ""cradle"") and a reflector, a middle reflector, and a rear face (or ""tape"") that reflects the sunlight back towards the sun. The reflectors are typically made from quartz.

The first MPPT components, or ""diodes"" as traditional PV solar systems are made from glass. Each front face of the photovoltaic cells must be sealed on its faces with a bond coat. The glass is then heated up to 400 °C (800 °F) and it is then filled with gold-plated insulation. The circuit board must be made from a glass substrate and the glass must be tempered at 450 °C (800 °F) for three minutes which makes it harder to use for mounting. The glass must then be coated with a protective film and then the bond coat is applied.

The glass is then placed on the circuit board and the board is tempered as well. The glass is then coated with a protective coat and the glass is placed on the front face of the PV array.

UVs from the sun and backscatter from the windows make up what is known as a ""Shade Scattering"" which is what is used to reflect the sunlight back towards the sun.

UVs in other parts of a PV array are ""Scatters"" which scatter the sunlight back into the space it was reflected from.",An MPPT device is usually integrated into the electric power converter system.

What is bicycling and why would someone do it?  Is bicycling healthy and joyful or is it painful and a waste of time?  How many bicycles should you have?  Which part of the world do you find the most people bicycling?,"Bicycling is often considered a ""waste of time"" activity.  Bicycling takes up a lot of time, energy, and money, but even if you don't want to get too bogged down in the details it can be a great way to get away from the noise of daily life and focus on doing something that truly connects with you.  Bicycling is a great way to disconnect from the noise and enjoy the beauty of nature and the view.  Bicycling also provides a new perspective on life and always leaves me feeling more grounded, peaceful, and positive.","Bicycling is a form of human powered movement that typically involves sitting or standing on a machine with two wheels that can be propelled forward by using one's arms or legs.  The bicycle was invented in the early 1800 (1817) by a German inventor named Drais.  The early bicycles were built from wood and soon after used heavy steel for the frame and wheels.  These steel bikes were called Boneshakers because when you road on them you would feel every stone and bump through your bones.  Bicycling exists in nearly every corner of the world, on every continent and it is done by all people.  In many countries, bicycling is the primary mode of transportation for people, especially in urban settings.  Bicycling is also a professional sporting competition where men and women race against one another in large groups in front of cheering crowds.

The boat was powered by two gasoline engines mounted in the aft section, one in the middle and one in the stern.  The stern drive was a diesel engine, and the rudder allowed the boat to turn freely. The boat was equipped with a 34 in (48 cm)ft beam and a weathertight compartment in the middle of the fuscon, which could accommodate a large amount of equipment.",SM U-30 was one of 329 U-boat submarines serving in the Imperial German Navy in World War I.

11)Focal length","If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.
1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.81714,0.927962,0.99463,0.857492,0.80823,0.881091,-15.470483779907227

what are ISO compliant crypto currencies?,"There are many ways to define crypto currencies as being equivalent. Despite being similar in terms of name and function, there are still many distinct differences between each of these two types of crypto currencies.

The most popular name is BTC, the most common digital currency, while the most widely used names are SNS, XRP, and DEX.

Another difference is that in crypto currency terms, the public blockchain is not known. As such, it is not considered a 'currency' (i.e., the same as a stock or bond).

1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. 
3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris.

Describe the governing arrangements provided by the Articles of Confederation. What were the main weaknesses of the document?,"The Articles of Confederation were passed in 1765 by Congress due to the ""encroachments upon the rights"" of the states. The powers of the states, which were derived from the Articles of Confederation, were specified in the Articles, which were made part of the three-year treaty between the United States and Great Britain. The Constitution of the United States, passed by the United States Congress in 1795, largely mirrored the terms of the Articles of Confederation, but it also expanded the powers of the states. The Constitution established a federal government with the power to tax and collect income, revenue, and defense from states. It also established a uniform system of national government, based on the states' rights to representation in the federal government. The three-year treaty with Great Britain, which ended in 1783, was the principal achievement of the Constitution.","The Articles of Confederation (AoC) was the first written constitution of the United States. There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias.

"Give me a one line summary of this: ""Gale gave me a sense of security I’d lacked since my father’s death. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in the woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn’t have to look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was watching my back…Being out in the woods with Gale…sometimes I was actually happy.”","Gale, the last of the blood brothers, was murdered by his former lover, Pamela, while she was hiking near a small creek in the woods near his home. 

The last of the blood brothers was never mentioned again, and the pair was never heard from again.

A few years later, a group of hunters and trappers joined the hunt for the last of the blood brothers, and along with a crew of four returned to the woods to find the bodies of three of the four brothers.

The third brother, Balthazar, was never found, and as the hunters and trappers began to plan their next expedition, a young woman named Lucy Crews was recruited to join them.

Lucy was the daughter of the last of the blood brothers, and like her father, she had grown up with Gale.

Lucy soon realized that the blood brothers had been much more than just friends and family.

She also learned that there was more to them than just blood.

Lucy learned that Gale was a hunter, not just a hunter, and that he had dedicated his life to proving himself to be one.

She also learned that Gale had left behind a legacy of honor, not just to his family, but to his friends and his country.

If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?","25 rabbits and 88 feets = 88 duck. Let’s say the total number of ducks is 88 ducks, then the total number of rabbits is 25 rabbits. So, the total number of rabbits is 26 rabbits.Therefore, the total number of ducks is 25 ducks. Therefore, the total number of ducks is 25 ducks = 25 ducks = 25 ducks. So, the total number of ducks is 25 ducks.","Let’s use equations to solve it! 
Let the number of ducks be X and the number of rabbits be Y.
We have X + Y = 25 and 2X + 4Y = 88.
Simplifying the first equation, we get Y = 25 - X
Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88
Which means 2X = 100 – 88 = 12, thus X = 6.
We substitute back into the first equation, we have Y = 25 - 6 = 19.

What is a quantum computer?,A quantum computer is a computer that can execute a single instruction.,"A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.881682,0.985278,0.997248,0.057564,0.872805,0.758916,-2.7130720615386963

A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.
1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.

How can I decide what bike I should get?,"First, you need to decide if you want a road bike or a trail bike. Trail bikes have smaller tires and are best suited for shorter rides.

Trail bikes tend to be steeper and wider, but have wider tires and are better suited for longer rides. 

Depending on what you want, you can get a road or trail bike. If you want a road bike, you will want a road tire and a road frame that are highend/expensive to maintain. If you want a trail bike, you will want a trail tire and a trail frame that are cheaper and easier to maintain. 

If you are looking for a road bike, you will want a road tire that is a bit wider than the road tire but a bit steeper and longer. If you are looking for a trail bike, you will want trail tires that are a bit wider than the road tires but a bit steeper.

2. Mountain bikes - These bikes are made to sustain the rough terrain that you could come across while biking. The tires are much thicker made to protect you and give you the support you need.
3. Hybrid/Commuter bikes - These bikes fall into the middle of the above 2 categories. If you think you might do a bit of road biking and mountain biking, then this might be your best option.

The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction.

What is the difference between natural and real numbers?,"Real numbers are numbers that exist as numbers.  Natural numbers are numbers that don't exist as numbers.  Real numbers are numbers that exist as numbers and are either integers or fractions, while natural numbers are numbers that are either whole numbers or not fractions.  It is the difference between natural and real numbers that allows us to distinguish them.  Consider the following example:  For every positive integer n, there is an element of the natural numbers, namely 0, so that n is itself an integer.  Therefore, 0 is a natural number.  However, when we consider a fraction of 0, it is called a real number.  In contrast, when we consider a fraction of 1, it is called an imaginary number.  Real numbers can be divided by 1 to form 1/2 which is an example of an imaginary number.  Real numbers can also be divided by 0 to form 0/2 which is an example of an natural number.","Natural numbers include positive whole numbers. For example, 1 and 2 belong to the natural set of numbers. Real numbers include any numbers between minus infinity and plus infinity.

The Act focused on the internment of Chinese nationals residing in the United States and provided for their expulsion from the country.

What are some contributions of women in computing?,"Some of the most significant contributions to the field of computing women in computing include:
* Symbolic Grammars: Women in computing have greatly contributed to the development of symbolic grammars. The first symbolic grammars appeared in the 1970s and were extremely powerful. However, this period saw a decline in the number of computing jobs, and in the 1980s, the number of computing jobs declined dramatically. 

Some of the most important contributions to the field of computing women in computing include:
* Rationalisation of programming languages: Women in computing have contributed greatly to the rationalisation of programming languages. The first rationalisation of programming languages, the Lisp, was published by Michael Spivak. Lisp was originally developed by Ray Kurzweil in the 1970s. By the early 1980s, women in computing were working in an increasingly large number of technical roles, so that by the late 1980s, women were working in technical fields other than computer science.
* Complexity and efficiency: Women in computing have contributed to the development of algorithms that are both faster and more efficient. 

Complexity in computing stems from the use of computers for many tasks. These include solving problems using algorithms, such as heuristics and fuzzy searching. However, in many cases, these applications are limited by the hardware. For example, a digital computer uses a very large amount of memory, and generally, the amount of memory available for a computer increases with the number of processors it has. 

In addition to the use of hardware for many tasks, women are also increasingly using these computing resources for other purposes. These include serving as a host for network servers, running databases, and providing computing power to other computing resources. The use of computing resources for these purposes is growing rapidly, and has contributed to the development of new paradigms of computing.
","The first algorithm intended to be executed by a computer was designed by Ada Lovelace who was a pioneer in the field. Grace Hopper was the first person to design a compiler for a programming language. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, and up to World War II, programming was predominantly done by women; significant examples include the Harvard Computers, codebreaking at Bletchley Park and engineering at NASA.",0.98475,0.998872,12.686727,0.996025,0.995487,3.332372,-4.393958568572998

- MPT attempts to minimize risks in the form of variance. However, this metric doesn’t reflect investors’ true concerns in practice. Variance is symmetric, so it punishes high returns the same way as high losses. However, investors care more about loss than gain, so the perception of risk is asymmetric in nature. Coherent risk measures should be a better metric that reflects investors’ preference

Roast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!

If the pilot light does not light or continues to go out after heating the water, the thermal coupling on the water heater likely needs to be replaced. Contact a plumber to have this replaced.

"What is the nature of god, from a logical perspective?","The nature of god is a blank slate.  The nature of god is that of being blank.  That is, no qualities can be ascribed to the nature of god, including either human attributes or divine qualities.  The nature of god is also that of being a blank slate, as there is no prior ability to define or assign attributes to this blankness.  The nature of god is one in which there is no innate knowledge of, or a innate ability to define, the attributes of God.  There is no innate knowledge of the nature of the divine person who is God, and no innate ability to define the attributes of God as God.  The nature of god, then, is that of not being known, or even recognised, as divine personhood.  This is because the nature of god, as such, is that of not being known or known as divine personhood.  This is a non sequitur.  There is no intrinsic knowledge of the nature of divine personhood, and no innate ability to define or attribute divine qualities to this awareness.  
The nature of being divine is not merely being a blank slate, it is being a blank slate devoid of knowledge.  The nature of being divine is not in virtue of possessing any knowledge of the nature of divine personhood, for that knowledge is derived from the divine personhood itself.  The nature of being divine is not in virtue of possessing any innate knowledge of divine personhood, for that knowledge is independent of any knowledge of divine personhood.  The nature of being divine is in virtue of being a blank slate devoid of knowledge of divine personhood, as the nature of being divine is a non sequitur.","Assuming god exists, one can think of the nature of god in two dimensions: is god active or passive, and is god benevolent or indifferent? Therefore, god is either active and benevolent, active and indifferent, passive and benevolent, or passive and indifferent. If god is active and benevolent, then all the bad things that happen would not happen, so this combination is unlikely.

write a short essay on murals in jersey city,"Hello and welcome to jersey city.
My name is Chris, and I'm a lifelong Jerseyian. I started my career in the industry in the early 2000s, when I was hired by the borough of Jersey City. The first time I was in the borough was in the late 1980s. We had the first park mural, And That's So Good, that was done by the Jersey City Art Institute in 1987. It was done by someone named Alisha. I'm the artist in residence. The most popular mural in Jersey City was done by a local muralist, Mattias, in the early 1990s. The most popular mural in Jersey was done by a local muralist, Marty, in 2016. He'd know me by name. He'd know me by first name, and he'd know me by my nick, which is my initial, as well as my middle name. I've been in Jersey City for 25 years, and I also live in Jersey City now. I'm an artist, but I used to be a writer. I've been a journalist for many years, and I've written about Jersey for many years. The most popular Jersey City mural is called Jersey Killers. It's a mural by someone named John McCauley, and it's by a local New York artist. We had The Great Train Robbery [by Edward M. Rosser], which is by one of my friends. It was done in the early 90s. It was by a local artist, but it was done by someone named Eddie. It's a mural by Blackie, who was in Jersey City when it was done. It's been done every year since the 1990s. Jersey Killers was done in the mid-90s. Some people call it the Jersey Shore Murals, because it's a part of the Jersey Shore. I called it Jersey Killers, because I considered the Jersey Shore Murals to be part of Jersey City. The Jersey Killers mural was by one of my friends.
A few years ago, I was in a meeting with a group of artists, and I saw a mural that I really liked. It was by one of my friends, and it was done in the mid-90s. It was by one of my favorite artists, Jon, and it was done in the mid-90s. I really liked it. It was called Jersey Killers. I was able to talk to Jon and we decided to do Jersey","Jersey City is known for its vibrant street art scene, with murals adorning walls throughout the city.

What is the history of coffee?,"Coffee is one of the oldest beverages in the world. It was first brewed in Mesopotamia around 4000 BC, and since then, it was used in coffee production to brew for about 7000 years. Coffee has been used in the industrial revolution, as a drink at home, and in workplaces, for more than 4,000 years.","Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?","Consistency and levels of conceptualization are two important dimensions of the JCPOA debate. One key factor is the extent to which a country or administration supports the “accord.” The JCPOA, for example, is supported by one powerful country, the United States, and the other countries/government entities (primarily Iran) that support the accord. The goal is for the JCPOA to be seen as a success and for the American people to support the agreement. The other factor is the extent to which a competing administration or government or nation or entity supports the JCPOA. For example, one administration, or government or nation, could support the JCPOA, but not because they “do not like” the terms of the accord, since they do not like the terms that the accord uses. Another administration, or government or nation, could not support the JCPOA because it does not want to support the accord. This is often seen in the Democratic Party of America, for example, which is a strong supporter of the accord, but not because they have a different viewpoint on Iran, or are not entirely supportive of the terms that the accord uses.","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.

Why should people convert lawns and ornamental gardens to native plants?,Native plants are great for people to enjoy enjoying the outdoors. They provide a great way to enjoy the outdoors and also provide a great way to grow food.

But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?

One of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.

The other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a",0.021647,0.991492,3.974995,0.947366,0.026896,1.192479,-2.9897844791412354

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease.

How do I learn how to code?,"To learn how to code, you need to first understand the basics of the language.

Most languages have some set of skills to become a good programmer, such as C, C++, and Java.","Starting to code can be easy and fun. A common path is to enroll into a higher education institution which often have rigorous curricula which will equip you with the fundamentals. 

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.

Who is the greatest musical theatre composer of all time?,Many people would say that the greatest musical theatre composer of all time is Gustav Holst.,"While art is subjective, there are a few luminary composers who have made significant contributions to musical theatre and whose work has stood the test of time. One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having ""hummable"" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with ""Send in",0.94204,0.985997,0.99843,0.039549,0.93627,0.780457,-2.3956139087677

A good baseball hitter can also use their strength and athleticism to their advantage to play defense, field first, third, batting third, and play solid defense.","There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion.

Why do hindus worship idols?,Idols are a potent substitute for worshipping God. Husbands often worship idols in order to uplift the morale of their wives and children. Husbands should not worship idols as it will lead to divorce and may even lead to child abuse. Idols have also been used as a way to attract young girls to marriage. Hindus believe that the worship of idols will cleanse away negative energies in the home and will bring a positive outcome.,Religion is man made. History teaches us that Religion was invented to separate humans and create a fear. Religion and Faith are different. Hinduism is not a religion but on the contrary it is a way of life. There is no one leader or master in hinduism like in christianity or islam and it is totally inclusive. Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings. So start your day with a prayer to elephant god. Thus you have 1000's of idols each representing a specific character in humans.,0.890715,0.997549,4.97029,0.954931,0.888794,1.740456,-3.6258342266082764

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.",0.690152,0.986887,1.934159,0.114608,0.682447,0.88165,-2.865781307220459

what is the difference between ARM and x86 chipsets?,"The main difference between ARM and x86 chipsets is the way that the hardware is programmed into the CPU. Whereas x86 is programmed in the chip into a subset of cores, which is then split between the cores, the ARM processor is programmed into each core separately.

The processor's core is programmed into the CPU's die in a way that allows it to be optimized for the specific purpose the processor is intended to perform. So, a processor designed to do something like run a web server may be optimized for something that does not require a web server (e.g. it may be optimized to do a batch of calculations). Each core is programmed differently, however, and the general trend is that a higher percentage of cores are programmed into the processor, and the remainder are optimized for specific workloads.",ARM uses Reduced Instruction Set Computing Architecture (RISC) whereas x86 uses Complex Instruction Set Computing Architecture (CISC). ARM executes single instruction per cycle whereas x86 executes complex instructions in multiple cycles. This allows softwares to be optimized for performance against ARM chipset as opposed to an 86 hardware approach to optimize. It would also be interesting to mention that ARM uses higher memory and less registers compared to x86.,0.883795,0.999122,5.801524,0.727094,0.894197,1.861146,-3.475278854370117

How are odds different from probability?,"Oddness is a measure of how much a given event is different from the probability of the event occurring.  Oddness can be defined as a percentage of cases that the event does not occur, or that the event occurs.  Probability is the number of cases in which the event does occur.  Odds are the number of cases in which the event occurs.","Both are measurements for how likely it is for an event to occur. Odds are commonly used in gambling, which probability is a measure that is commonly used in mathematics/statistics. In statistics, probability measures the number of outcomes in which a particular event occurred divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days. The odds are measured as the number of events divided by the number of non-events. To contrast, probability would be the number of events divided by the sum of events and non-events.",0.898717,0.997818,3.970823,0.841073,0.901065,1.521899,-3.3290340900421143

The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul.

1. Check-in: When a passenger is assigned to a seat, they must enter a boarding pass and purchase a boarding pass in their carry on luggage.

2. Booking: The passenger must check in before the carrier's designated arrival time and verify the passenger's name and boarding pass. Once the passenger is verified, the passenger is given boarding passes and is given instructions on how to use them.

3. Security screening: At this checkpoint, passengers are screened and asked about their travel plans, membership status, and whether they require a security check.

4. Security passes: The passenger must present their boarding pass and take a security check by entering the passenger name and security code on a reader card or a security checkpoint.

5. Security check: Once the passenger is screened and verified, they enter a code that will be used to check their boarding passes and check-in at the next available seat. If the passenger has missed their next scheduled flight, they will be asked to re-check their boarding pass and enter in their in-car computer.

What is a typical Humpback Whale migration pattern,"A typical Humpback Whale migration pattern consists of a series of large movements. Depending on a whale's environment, it can be either a swim migration, or a gliding migration. Swimmers typically migrate from the southern margin of their breeding grounds, in search of food, to the northern margin, where they breed or forage. Gliding whales typically migrate from the southern shore, to the breeding grounds that are located further north.

Swimmers and gliding whales often migrate in small groups, called pods. As the whales migrate further south, they can change their habitat. For example, a gliding whale could migrate to the southern margin for mating, or to migrate to breed off the southern coast.

In the majority of cases, the movements are continuous. Swimmers and gliding whales may migrate together, or they may migrate separately. However, in some cases, there are isolated movements. For example, a gliding whale might be accompanied by a swimmer, while another whale might migrate accompanying a swimmer.

The movements are typically associated with intense competition, especially from other gliding whales. Swimmers and gliding whales may also exhibit a social environment. Swimmers will interact, and will communicate, with each other. This may include displaying displays of affection, displaying overt displays of aggression, or displaying behaviors that are playful.

The majority of movements are thought to be completely random. However, some researchers consider that the randomness is present in a systematic way. For example, if a gliding whale migrates to the southern margin in search of food, and then swims to the northern margin, the gliding whale might migrate in a single large group, with a combination of swimmers and gliders. The group would likely build a nest of its own, and would start to breed.

Those examples are considered to fit a pattern of a gliding whale migration, however, they are not considered a complete pattern. The pattern involves multiple movements across the Southern Hemisphere, and the pattern cannot be simply explained as a random one.","Humpback whales will typically feed in the summer months off the rich waters of Alaska, northern Canada and eastern Russia, and begin their migration to warmer waters of Hawaii or Mexico starting in mid-fall to breed.  The migration takes about 6 to 8 weeks and they begin arriving in Hawaii in late October/early November.  They will stay in warmer regions to breed and calve their babies during winter, and will start their migration back to the polar regions by late March or April.  It is estimated that up to 14,000 whales make this migration to Hawaii every winter.",0.582629,0.999743,19.2203,0.990368,0.650773,4.488762,-4.301869869232178

You can use Python, R, or MATLAB to create a Python-based program and then run it on the data in the form of Python. 
The data science language is called dashboard, and it is usually written in Python from scratch.","Forecasting with small datasets can be challenging, as many traditional methods require larger amounts of data for accurate predictions.
Here are few approaches that can help you.

Simple moving average: This involves taking the average of a certain number of past data points, and using it as the forecast for the next period. This method can be effective for stable time series with no trend or seasonality.

Exponential smoothing: This method assigns exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, with more recent observations being given more weight. This method can be effective for time series with trend and/or seasonality.

ARIMA: The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a popular choice for time series forecasting. It can be effective for small datasets if the underlying data follows a pattern that can be modeled using an ARIMA model.",0.520476,0.981636,3.78708,0.517731,0.520349,1.265454,-4.4790778160095215

What are the applications of game theory in NBA basketball?,"The NBA has utilized a variety of applications of game theory in basketball.  

1. One of the most popular applications of game theory in basketball is the field of basketball scoring.  There are two types of scoring in the NBA.  The 1st is the offensive scoring.  This is the style of scoring where the defense has to stop the offense.  The 2nd type of scoring is defense.  This is more of a basketball offense where the offense must stop the defense.  

The two types of scoring in the NBA are the above mentioned, but with one major difference.  The 2nd type of scoring is called ""Defense"".  Offensive scoring is an offense played with the defense.  

Defense is the main type of scoring in the NBA.  In the 2nd style of scoring, the team has to stop the opposing team's defense.  

The defense will stop the offense when the defense is called upon.  This is called ""Defense"" in the NBA.  When the defense is called upon and the team has to stop the offense,  then the offense will score.  

Another application of game theory is the 4th differential.  The 4th differential is when the teams are tied at the same position.  If the teams are tied at the same position, then the team with the most points is the team with the advantage.  The 4th differential is the most valuable when the teams are tied.  

The 4th differential in the NBA is called ""Defense"".  

2. Another example of a game theory application in basketball is ""Scoring"" in the NBA.  This is when the team must stop their opponent's offense.  This is called ""Defense"" in the NBA.  This happens in the 2nd style of scoring.  

The 2nd style of scoring is usually referred to as ""Passing"" in the NBA.  This is when the defense has to stop the offense.  

The passing is done when the defense is called upon to stop their offense.  

The 4th differential is when the teams are tied at the same position.  If the teams are tied at the same position, then the 4th differential is when the teams that have been tied at the same position have a higher scoring percentage.  The 4th differential is the most valuable when the teams are tied.  

The 4th differential in the NBA is called ""Scoring"".","Game theory studies the strategic interaction of rationale agents. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy. Now nearly all NBA teams employ this strategy, so it is less effective (A Nash (Not Steve Nash!) Equilibrium).",0.712425,0.998797,25.254549,0.961319,0.734629,5.732344,-4.933989524841309

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye,Bill Nye is the host of the new Netflix series Bill Nye: Science of Everything. Bill Nye hosts the show and was the host for the first season of the show.,"Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.388381,0.829147,1.912814,0.027537,0.478497,0.727275,-3.1916749477386475
