An aggressive defense attorney is one that will fight on your behalf and will likely try to negotiate a settlement with the prosecutor to reduce or dismiss the charges against you.  An aggressive defense attorney will likely spend more time going over discovery documents with you, gaining a better understanding of the case and the evidence against you.  He or she will also be better able to communicate with you and help you to understand the likely outcomes of your case.  \n\nA third approach is to simply pay the ticket, either up front or in installments.  While this may not seem like the most attractive strategy, it is not uncommon for a defendant to pay a speeding ticket in full or in part.  There are two main reasons that a defendant may be inclined to pay a speeding ticket.  First, a defendant's insurance may cover the speeding ticket.  Second, a defendant may simply not want to incur the time and expense of a trial if they believe they will lose.  \n\nOn the other hand, paying a speeding ticket may not be the best strategy either.  If you are caught speeding by the police and your insurance carrier doesn't pay the ticket, your insurance carrier may take action against you (e.g., deny you coverage, restrict access to your car) and place a lien on your car.  \n\nIf you are not insured, paying the ticket will likely result in a larger judgment being entered against you in the event that you are convicted.  The judgment will likely fall on your car title and your car will be impounded.  As a result you may have to spend more money in order to redeem your car.  \n\nA final approach is to settle the case without going to trial.  In such a case, the prosecutor will likely offer to dismiss the speeding ticket in exchange for a payment from the defendant.  If you are willing to make a payment towards the ticket, you may be able to avoid going to trial entirely or at least significantly reduce the charge against you.  \n\nAn experienced attorney can help you select the most appropriate course of action.", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.

However, in the 1950s and 1960s, there were very few women in this field and the most influential ones were Grace Hopper, Alta M. Green, and Ada Lovelace.  Grace Hopper was perhaps the best known computer scientist of the time and is often referred to as the \"mother of the modern computer\" in recognition of her role in the invention of the computer.  She is also credited with coining the term \"computer science\" during the early 1950s.  Hopper's work at the United States Navy'sCode & Language School is where she first used a computer to solve a problem and broke the barrier for women to be involved in computer science.  Her legendary ability to solve complex problems with a computer quickly made her the go-to person for the Navy on computing matters.  Alta M. Green had a similar career trajectory and is also considered one of the first computer scientists.  The reason for this is that she not only used her background as a mathematician to understand the logic of the digital computer but also was able to teach herself programming when she needed to.  This made her an invaluable member of the MIT AI Lab and one of the most influential computer scientists of the time.  Her work with the AI Lab was extended when she wrote the first computer program to solve the famous traveling salesman problem in 1957.  This allowed computers to be used on more complex problems and provided an entry point for women to enter computer science.  Alta M. Green also did early work on the design of a compiler and also invented the first symbolic computer program known as the \"Semantic Analyzer\" which was used to help develop the first compiler.  This led to her being recognized by the National Academy of Sciences as \"one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century\".  She was also a pioneer for better representation of computer code on paper and created the first computer language that utilized markup symbols to write computer code.  These achievements were followed by Ada Lovelace, who is often referred to as the \"mother of computer science\".  Lovelace was one of the few women at the time who had a background in mathematics and knew how to program.  Her work was widely used in the development of the first computer algorithms and programs and is considered as the \"mother of AI\".  She is also credited with the first ever computer algorithm that utilized mathematics to model the behavior of objects", "evaluation_criteria": "We would like to request your feedback on AI assistant's ability to engage in natural dialogue with the user, in the style similar to an attentive, courteous and empathetic customer support agent, based on the above exchange.\nPlease provide ratings on a 10-point scale based assistant's exhibited abilities in the following:\n 1) follows dialogue conventions such as turn taking, acknowledging the speaker, and signaling investment in the conversation; \n 2) recognizes the user's intent, and appropriately acknowledges it in its response;\n 3) understands rhetoric relations between user's and assistant's utterances; \n 4) keeps track of entites and facts mentioned throughout the dialogue, and is able to effortlessly refer back to them or understand the user's references to them. \nPlease first output a single line containing comma separated scores as integers on the above dimensions for the Assistant.
