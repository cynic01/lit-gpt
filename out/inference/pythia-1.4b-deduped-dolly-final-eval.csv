What is the Premier League?,The Premier League is the top flight of English football. It is the most important football competition in the world. It is considered the world's most popular league.,"The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888; however, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky: from 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively.

Why do people need money?,"Despite the fact that money is not necessary for almost all human activities, money plays an important role in a person's personal life. It provides an alternative to non-monetary forms of support such as food and shelter. Without money, a person can be unable to meet basic needs, such as food or shelter. There are various reasons why people need money.

Income for basic needs
People need money to buy food and other basic needs. Poor people especially depend on income from working to meet their basic needs. If they are unable to work, they will have to resort to borrowing or selling some of their belongings in order to purchase food or other basic needs.

Financial security
People need money to invest in a bank account, vehicles, real estate, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. If they cannot afford to buy these financial products, they will have to rely on other sources of income to survive. For example, people sell their labor to make money.

Social status
People need money to show their social status. People who own more money are perceived as more powerful, wealthy, and successful than those who do not. Therefore, those with more money are more likely to have a good social life and enjoy more social opportunities.

Protection
People may use money to provide a person with protection from personal or social risks. For example, a person might use money to buy insurance against a medical condition or a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a typhoon.

Cultural and religious beliefs
People may use money to pay for cultural and religious rituals and customs. For example, people may use money to buy a new house or a new car as part of their religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to pay for the expenses of a trip to another country as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to pay for a business or personal service as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to pay for a wedding or other celebrations as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to buy supplies such as rice, flour and other grains, and other groceries as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to purchase essential items such as toothpaste, shampoo, soap, diapers, and other supplies as part of his or her religious and cultural rituals.

A person may use money to","People need money to satisfy their basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter so they lead a humane life.

The absolute value of -4 is 2, not 1. The absolute value of 2 is 0 which is also a whole number. Therefore, subtracting 2 from 4 using the absolute value method is equivalent to subtracting 2 from 0.","Subtraction is an operation that identifies the total count of objects in a collection of items after a specific count of items are removed from the starting total.

You can subtract two numbers by starting with an initial count, which represents the number to subtract from, and a second count which represents the number to subtract.  Then remove one from the starting count repeating this operation for the number of items in the subtract value.  

Subtraction is not associative, which means that the order in which subtraction is performed matters.  For instance, seven minus five (7 - 3) equals four (= 4) but four minus seven (4 - 7) equals minus three (= -3).",0.682333,0.989955,6.347469,0.634314,0.727841,1.876383,-3.3005287647247314

Hi, I just wanted to share my experience with you.  I have been looking to join a big business and I was originally going to apply for a role at a global company, but I have been looking online for a few months and have finally come across your profile and have decided to apply. 
I am studying at university for a Masters in International Business and I have already applied for the Masters program and am waiting for the acceptance email. 
I really want to join a big company but am unsure of which one to apply for. I have looked at a number of different companies and have narrowed my choice down to 2 companies. One of which I was able to attend the interview at last week and the other I was not able to attend due to work commitments. I do not want to waste my time at this point, as I want to start my career now, but I do not want to waste any more time.

What is a spatial network?,"A spatial network (also called a spatial graph or spatial network) is a mathematical abstraction of networks that are built on the idea that edges are not only present, but also weighted. Networks represent interactions between entities. Spatial networks are a mathematical abstraction of the vertices of networks. The vertices are represented as points in a two-dimensional space. Each edge is represented by a line or a set of lines that connect the vertices. The direction of the lines is the direction of the edge. The weight of an edge is the length of the line multiplied by the relative abundance of vertices that are connected by the edge.","A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.",0.855734,0.998707,6.085962,0.773593,0.876916,1.918182,-3.5837464332580566

What are the differences between a ukulele and guitar?,"There are many differences between a ukulele and a guitar.  The most important difference is the shape of the soundboard.  There are four main types of soundboards:
- Solidwood
- Maple
- Pine
- Basswood

The soundboard is the thin sound board that connects the strings of the instrument to the body of the instrument.  The soundboard is also the material that the strings are made of.

The soundboard is made from the same material as the top of the sound box, the top of the instrument.  This makes it very lightweight and thin.  It also has a degree of flexibility, which allows it to be bent and plucked without breaking.  The soundboard is also made in the shape of a U (for ""Ukelele""), which makes it even thinner, allowing it to be played in a way that is easier on the hand.

The other difference between a ukulele and a guitar is the shape of the soundhole.  The soundhole is a square opening located in the center of the body of the instrument, where the strings are strung.  The soundhole is shaped so that it fits comfortably into the hand of a musician.  The soundhole is made larger for the ukulele, which makes the sound of the instrument better when played.  The soundhole is also made smaller for the guitar, which makes playing the guitar easier on the hands.","While a ukulele looks like a smaller version of a guitar, there are some notable differences.

A guitar has 6 strings and a ukulele has 4 strings. Because of this, the sound range of a ukulele is narrower than a guitar.

Looking from the front of a guitar, the thickness of the strings increases gradually from right to left. For a ukulele, the two outmost strings are the thinnest and the second left string is the thickest. 

A ukulele is much smaller in the size, making it one of the most popular beginner instrument for kids.",0.697629,0.999078,11.091156,0.985462,0.785087,2.911682,-4.53297758102417

Which is better - skiing or snowboarding,Skiing is the more relaxing sport than snowboarding and it is suitable for all ages. You can learn how to ski in a few days and keep it as a hobby for life.,"I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. 

Expediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.",0.95287,0.994571,1.972106,0.117445,0.948492,0.997097,-2.9369940757751465

How do I get in shape?,"There is no one ""get in shape"" method; everyone's ideal body composition is different.  However, there are many types of exercises that can be used as a means of getting in shape.  Some of the most common types of exercise include but are not limited to walking, running, lifting weights, yoga, hula hooping, jumping jacks, stair climbing, pull ups, and chest presses.  The goal is to get your heart rate up and level the intensity of the exercise.  When you are exercising, you should focus on how you feel after the workout.  Do you feel tired?  Did you have sore muscles?  Do you feel hungry?  Do you have a lump in your throat?  When you are exercising, pay attention to how you are physically feeling.  If you feel tired, it is OK to stop.  If you are sore or had a hard time breathing after your workout, it is also OK to stop.  If you feel hungry, it is OK to eat something.  If you feel like you are going to throw up, it is OK to stop and get a snack.  If you feel like you really want to jump up and down on the floor, it is OK to do that.  Keep doing exercise until you are able to tell if you are getting better or worse.  If you are still having trouble getting your heart rate up, take a longer warm up, and/or an easier exercise like walking or jumping jacks.  Also, if you are still having trouble getting your heart rate up, find a friend that is a good friend and does the exercise with you.","There are many great workout styles that can improve your physical health. For example, yoga is great for increasing blood flow, reducing stress levels in the body, and improving flexibility. If you're interested in these benefits, as well as losing weight, I recommend exploring ""Hot Yoga"" as a more intense variation. Another method of getting into shape is through strength training. This type of workout is focused on lifting weights to put stress on your muscles. This stress leads to micro-tears in your muscles, which heal to become even stronger than before! Some great strength training workouts include; Squats, bench press, and bicep curls. If you are looking to begin a workout regiment that you can do rather independently, running is a great option. Running leads to increased cardiovascular health and muscular strength in your legs.

What should I consider before taking a job with a lot of travel?,"To consider how travel affects your work is important. When considering a job with a lot of travel, it’s important to consider how you will be impacted by the travel. Some things to consider:

The type of travel. Do you travel a lot by yourself? What are your travel needs?

The amount of time away from home. Do you need to travel frequently? Do you need to travel for a particular project? Will you need to be home for long periods of time?

The length of the assignments. Travel assignments can be long term or short term. Will you be traveling for a long period of time?

The type of work being done. Do you need to be close by for a lot of the work? Do you need to be far away? Will you need to collaborate with other team members on projects?

Depending on your answers to these questions, you can make a plan on how you will handle travel with a lot of travel. For example, you might choose to:

Plan to go to work from home when there is travel.

Plan to travel to the office but schedule vacation days to take the work home with you.

Plan to travel to the office and work from home during the work day.

Plan to travel to the office and work from home during the evenings.

Plan to work from home during the nights and weekends.

This example is based on the fact that you will have to travel a lot and have some long term travel needs. If you are traveling a lot by yourself, you might consider working from home or using a remote work arrangement to reduce travel. If you are traveling frequently or for work that requires a lot of collaboration and collaboration between locations, you might consider a project work arrangement. Travel assignments for projects that don’t require a lot of collaboration between locations might be scheduled at specific times of the day when you are not impacted by travel.","Many people are attracted to jobs that have significant travel.

But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?

Give me a list of the five best ways to take care of your houseplants.,"Here are the five best ways to take care of your houseplants:
1. Provide regular water. Houseplants are thirsty, and need to be watered every day or two. If you don't provide them with enough water, they may die.
2. Change their water every few days. Houseplants like to be moved around and changed out of their pots. This can help with watering and humidity issues.
3. Keep them moist. If you don't provide them with as much water as they need, they may dry out and die.
4. Invert them. Houseplants like to be upside down, so you can change their water, add more water or add fertilizer.
5. Check their soil. Make sure the soil is moist enough and that they are getting the right nutrients. Houseplants like to be in soil that is well amended.","1. Get on a watering schedule so you can make sure you are not over-watering or under-watering the plants. 
2. Choose plants that will do well in the lighting conditions that you have available in your home. Place plants that like bright, direct light in front of windows, and choose plants that require less light for the darker areas of your home. 
3. Consider getting a humidifier if you are going to decorate your home with tropical plants. Certain tropical plants tend like to a more humid environment. 
4. If you don't have sufficiently bright natural light, consider getting grow lights to help your plants thrive.

What makes a Korean corn dog different from an American corn dog?,"A Korean corn dog is made with a mixture of tapioca flour, potato starch, tallow and wheat gluten. The main ingredient of the potato starch and tapioca flour is separated by heat, producing a white dough. The white dough is then mixed with the tallow and wheat gluten, yielding a dough that is mostly oil. The oil is then quickly heated, resulting in a crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. A large amount of sesame seeds are added to the dough at this point. The dough is then formed into a patty and placed on a hot grill. The corn dog is then finished cooking, taking about 5 minutes on each side.","Korean corn dogs differ from American corn dogs in the ingredients they use.

Running a business is tough and there will always be problems in the market.

His most recent book is The Happiness Hypothesis: How the New Science of Positive Psychology Can Make You Happier, Smarter, Stronger and More Loved.","To steward means to take care of, to guide, and it implies a sense of responsibility. I agree with 
the notion that, in addition to stories about capitalism prevailing as either an extractor or savior, a third story can be written of “prosperity with problems” in which participants are grateful for 
accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story? I believe that answer to be business leaders themselves -- or else be beholden to government regulation to steward the institution in the direction that benefits not just owners and shareholders, but all stakeholders including employees and the environment.

Give me ideas how I could become more productive.,"There are a number of things you could do to become more productive. Here are some ideas:
- Read more. Read at least 1-2 books a week.

- Set aside some time to write in a word document.
- Keep your phone on silent. Set your phone to silent.
- Turn off unnecessary apps.
- Look at your calendar and only check off things you need to deal with.
- Schedule some time to relax and be quiet.","Here are a few things you can try to become more productive:
1. Limit multitasking: While it may feel more productive, you can easily get distracted and spend more time on those tasks overall. Instead, try to complete one task to a higher standard in less time.
2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.

"In football, if touchdowns is the main way to get points, why can't the quarterback always throw the ball to the end zone every time?","There are many reasons that might explain why the quarterback might not always be able to get the closest to the end zone. For example, the end zone may not be clearly marked, or the quarterback may not be able to see it. In addition, the quarterback may not be able to see the ball, due to the sun's angle, or the ball may be out of his hands, for any of a variety of reasons.","To win at the game of American football, points are scored by touchdowns and kicking field goals, primarily. 
At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals. One of the key strategies is to mix it up, so that there is an element of surprise and the defense is caught off-guard.",0.938266,0.998087,2.995528,0.180154,0.936467,1.2097,-2.7692461013793945

How do government control inflation?,"The term inflation usually refers to the increase in the general price level of a country. In other words, the general price of a commodity, service, or product increases over time.
Many countries use different methods to control inflation.

These interest rate differentials are in the form of negative interest rates.

What is a p-value in statistics?,"A p-value (probability value) is a numeric measurement of the likelihood of a result being true based on the assumed true distribution of the outcome.  For example, if you assume that a coin will come up heads 50% of the time and tails 50% of the time, then a p-value of 50% is a measure of how many times that outcome is likely to occur when the true distribution is 50:50.  If you assign a smaller p-value to a result, the less likely it is to occur by chance alone.  The p-value is the probability that the result will occur by chance divided by the probability of the result occurring by chance alone.","In statistics, a p-value is used to test the significance of the hypothesis. It indicates the probability that the results were obtained by chance alone. A small p-value indicates that it is very unlikely that the observed result came about by chance. 
However, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial. Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis.",0.831925,0.996522,3.992401,0.699234,0.854589,1.474934,-3.5736961364746094

write short essay on Buzz Aldrin experience on moon,"Buzz Aldrin is a NASA explorer, astronaut, author, and educator. He was also a United States diplomat, who served as the ninth and only person to walk on the Moon.

After the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, which the United States sent him, Buzz Aldrin went on to have an extensive career in the United States Foreign Service, but was fired in the early 1990s for suspected espionage.

Buzz Aldrin is best known for being the first human to walk on the Moon, but he is also known for being the first person to survive a simulated nuclear explosion.","Buzz Aldrin, the second person to step onto the Moon's surface after Neil Armstrong, had a unique experience during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Like Armstrong, Aldrin spent just over two hours outside the lunar module, conducting experiments and collecting samples.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was both exhilarating and challenging. He described the lunar landscape as ""magnificent desolation,"" with vast, barren plains and towering mountains in the distance. Aldrin also noted the difficulty of moving around in the bulky spacesuit and the constant hissing sound of his oxygen supply.

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration.

If the clinic participates in the Medicaid program, they are required to charge a fee to cover the cost of vaccines.","The main difference between getting a vaccine at a clinic and a pharmacy comes down to the setting and the potential fees involved.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.
A pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.

Fees:
Both clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.

In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin.

I was a member of the staff of a big college and was in charge of a weekly DJ show. I was a DJ at a local club called The Coffee Club. The DJs would play techno music all night long. This was the first time that I had heard music that was so slow, and I could relate to it. I felt as if I was part of that club. 

I had this feeling that music should be slower, and it should be more relaxing. I remember listening to several tracks on my playlist that night, and that was when I fell in love with the music. My dreams changed when I started to work as a music producer.","Several renowned music artists died at age 27 which is also sometimes referred as the ""27 Club"".

How is it that some high net-worth individuals are able to avoid paying taxes completely?,"The concept of ""tax avoidance"" is controversial, so let's first define it. Tax avoidance is the practice of shifting income from one tax jurisdiction to another, usually by claiming that the income is subject to a tax in a jurisdiction that has no such tax. The term ""tax avoidance"" is sometimes used to refer to any such behavior. Tax avoidance is legal in some jurisdictions, but illegal in others.","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes regular income and investment income differently. For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all.",0.936825,0.99196,3.990708,0.728579,0.940332,1.517681,-3.245850086212158
How is the white color created?,"The white color is created by adding a strong yellow to a white base color. For example, adding yellow to white creates yellow-green.","The color white is created when all colors in the visible spectrum are combined in equal amounts. This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

In the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity. This creates a pure white color on electronic displays.",0.944262,0.997209,1.997639,0.117848,0.941256,0.999643,-3.9113285541534424

What is the key to longevity?,"Longevity is defined as the ability to maintain a healthy state of health for an extended period of time without disease or premature death.  There are a number of factors that can contribute to longevity.  The most significant of these is a healthy diet.  It is well known that eating a healthy diet, with plenty of fruits and vegetables will promote a long, healthy life.  The other factor that can contribute to longevity is physical activity.  Studies have shown that regular moderate exercise can reduce the risk of many chronic diseases and can promote healthy longevity.  Longevity is also dependent on the quality of a person's genes.  Genes have a significant impact on the risk of developing specific diseases.  If a person has a strong genetic makeup for a given disease, then the likelihood of that person living a healthy and long life is increased.  If a person has a weak genetic makeup for a given disease, then the likelihood of that person living a healthy and long life is reduced.  The combination of a healthy diet, regular moderate exercise, and a healthy genetic makeup is a recipe for long, healthy life.","Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. 
Researchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of.

As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc...

An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production.

"Based on the passage below, summarize Beethoven's contributions to western music.","Beethoven is widely acknowledged as the father of the classical music genre. He was the first composer to systematically create a system of harmony and structure to allow his compositions to be performed in a uniform manner, and his music is one of the most widely performed classical pieces in the world. 

Beethoven was born in Bonn, Germany, and after a short period in which he studied law, he turned to music at the age of 17. He wrote his first piano sonata in 1803 before his 20th birthday and shortly after that his first piano quartet. In 1805, he wrote his first symphony.

In 1806, he married his first wife, pianist Maria Antonyth, and the following year, he had his first major success with the symphony 'Eroica', which was performed by the Vienna Court Orchestra. He then wrote his first string quartet, which was performed for the first time by the Vienna String Quartet in 1807. In 1808, he wrote his first piano sonata, 'Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op. 26'. The following year, he wrote his first symphony, 'Eroica'. He then wrote his famous Opus 18, which was the first performance of the symphony and was performed for the first time by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. The symphony was a huge success and led to Beethoven being taken more and more seriously by the leading musical figures of the day, such as Liszt, Chabrier, and Schumann.

Beethoven's reputation as a composer grew more and more, and by the end of the 1810s, he had written the string quartet, the piano concerto, the piano sonata Op. 35, the 'Moonlight' Symphony, and the 'Eroica' Symphony. This was a remarkable string of success for Beethoven. He was also awarded the prestigious premiership 'Kreuzkürtner' from the Austrian court in 1814 for his contribution to music.

His life was not without its difficulties. In 1816, he was involved in a duel with his brother-in-law, the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. Ludwig was later to become famous as the composer of the Fourth Symphony, which is one of the most famous symphonies in the world.

In 1820, he suffered from a serious illness. Despite his illness, he wrote the celebrated path-breaking op","- Heightened the symphonic form and had a dramatic influence on the piano sonata, violin sonata, string quartet, piano concertos and other genres

What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a study that uses millions of genomic markers to identify rare variants that increase the risk of a disease or condition. The goal of a GWAS is to identify rare variants associated with complex diseases that may be actionable and have a biological basis.

A GWAS is typically conducted in a large sample of individuals and their family members. A GWAS is generally suitable for identifying rare variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of <0.5%. The heritability of common diseases is only 50–60%. This means that a rare variant is not inherited, but rather is a new mutation in the population. Rare mutations are common in the population, but rare mutations are very rare. Rare variants are also called common genetic variants.

A GWAS generally uses a whole genome sequencing approach to identify rare variants. A GWAS is a type of genome-wide association study (GWAS) because it is a genome-wide search for associations between genetic variations and a complex disease. Genome-wide association study has been used to identify associations between genetic variations and complex diseases.

A GWAS is a form of genetic association study; it uses a genome-wide search to identify genetic variations that increase the risk of a disease or condition. A genetic variant is a DNA sequence variation (single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP) that may be inherited. There are many types of genetic variation; most are inherited. The human genome is made up of about 22,000 genes; each gene produces a unique protein that performs a specific function. Variation in the genetic code can lead to an abnormal protein product. SNPs are the smallest of the genetic variants. A SNP is a single nucleotide polymorphism, or a change in the amount of a single nucleotide, that occurs in the genetic code.

SNPs are the most common types of genetic variation, and they are responsible for the majority of genetic variation in the human genome. The human genome is made up of about 22,000 genes that encode for proteins. SNPs are the smallest of the genetic variants, and they can change the amino acid sequence of a protein. SNPs can be inherited, and specific genes can influence the risk of developing a particular disease or condition.

SNP associations are the most widely used form of genetic association study. SNPs are single-nucleotide polymorphisms, which can be found in the genome and are associated with disease. All people have a small number of SNPs that are associated with their unique genetic code.

A GWAS","In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to",0.891386,0.999745,25.80209,0.993724,0.971384,5.931666,-3.968552589416504
"Extract the current cash rate from the following using the format: {x} percent

At its meeting today, the Board decided to increase the cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3.60 per cent. It also increased the interest rate on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 basis points to 3.50 per cent.
Global inflation remains very high. In headline terms it is moderating, although services price inflation remains elevated in many economies. It will be some time before inflation is back to target rates. The outlook for the global economy remains subdued, with below average growth expected this year and next.
The monthly CPI indicator suggests that inflation has peaked in Australia. Goods price inflation is expected to moderate over the months ahead due to both global developments and softer demand in Australia. Services price inflation remains high, with strong demand for some services over the summer. Rents are increasing at the fastest rate in some years, with vacancy rates low in many parts of the country. The central forecast is for inflation to decline this year and next, to be around 3 per cent in mid-2025. Medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it is important that this remains the case.

Javascript - Can I get a list of the user's past events?

I am looking for a way to get a list of the user's past events.  

These events are not necessarily things the user has done, so a list of ""funny"" things they've done would also be a good start.
A user's past events are not necessarily always tied to their current user.  In the example above, the user who recently joined might be a member of multiple past events.  A way to support all cases is to include a separate variable for each past event.
The thing I'm looking for is something that can be used for many uses, so it should be future-proof.

A:

The best way to do this is to create a database of each event, and store the information in a JSON file like this:
{
    ""event_id"": 1,
    ""name"": ""My Name"",
    ""summary"": ""Introducing myself"",
    ""description"": ""I am here to help with questions or issues.""
}

You can then use this JSON file as the basis of a web site, that can be accessed by the URL:

What is IMPS?,"IMPS is an acronym for Internet Message Protocol security.  It is a protocol provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to make it very easy for systems on the Internet to communicate securely.  IMPS is the core protocol used by an authentication server to communicate with a client application.  The client authenticates using an associated public key and then uses the private key to encrypt the data being sent from the server.  The encrypted data is then sent to the client application.  The client application decrypts the data using the private key and then uses the public key to authenticate the data.  This functionality allows IMPS to be used in an environment with a public Internet connection.  If the client does not have a private key, the server can use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt the data for the client.  The client then uses the private key to decrypt the data and then authenticates the data using the associated public key.  This allows IMPS to be used in a more secure environment, where the client and server do not have direct connectivity to each other.","Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) is an instant payment inter-bank electronic funds transfer system in India.

In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains.

How does the federal government of the USA implement separation of powers?,"The federal government was originally established by the Constitution of the United States of America. The separation of powers is the principle that each of the three branches of government - legislative, executive, and judicial - fulfills different functions. The legislative branch, composed of the congressional and state legislature, writes and passes laws, and has the power to impeach and remove federal officials. The executive branch, composed of the President of the United States and the Vice President, carries out the laws as passed by the legislative branch. The judicial branch, composed of the federal courts and district and appeals courts, interprets and applies the laws.","To maintain separation of powers, the US federal government has three branches that each maintain separate and independent powers: judicial, executive, legislative",0.92337,0.998256,4.937669,0.676911,0.916106,1.690462,-3.1251556873321533

What is oxidation reduction potential?,"Oxidation reduction potential (ORP) is the potential difference between the oxidation state of an ion (or a molecule) and its reduction potential. In other words, ORP is the difference between the oxidation state of an ion (or a molecule) and the reference potential. An oxidation state of +1 indicates that the ion (or a molecule) is in the oxidation state of +1 oxidation state. Conversely, an oxidation state of -1 indicates that the ion (or a molecule) is in the reduction state of -1 oxidation state. The oxidation state of an ion (or a molecule) can be calculated using the following equation:

ORP = Ered – Agapore","Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water.",0.685504,0.997355,4.935603,0.97869,0.72599,1.664628,-3.860924482345581

What is the United States Bill of Rights?,"The United States Bill of Rights is a compilation of the rights that are guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The Bill of Rights was written by the First Congress of the United States of America (Framingham, MA) on June 26, 1789, to provide protection for the people in the newly independent United States. The Bill of Rights is sometimes referred to as the ""Bill of Rights for a Free People"" because it was written to protect the rights all individuals enjoyed before the Constitution was formed. The Bill of Rights is located in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.","The United States Bill of Rights comprises the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the often bitter 1787–88 debate over the ratification of the Constitution and written to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically granted to the federal government by the Constitution are reserved to the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those in earlier documents, especially the Virginia Declaration of Rights (1776), as well as the Northwest Ordinance (1787), the English Bill of Rights (1689), and the Magna Carta (1215).",0.91934,0.99693,3.988674,0.781059,0.923066,1.521814,-2.6381990909576416
Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?,"The short answer is yes, learning piano on a grand piano is just as effective as learning on a upright piano.  You'll be able to play much faster and more effectively, while also having a better understanding of the keys and their functions.  This is because the keyboard is much larger than a grand or upright piano, with more keys and dedicated keys dedicated to a more complex musical note.","Since the layout of keys for both electronic keyboards and pianos are the same, keyboards could be effective for beginners. However, Pianos have more “action” than keyboards (i.e. how the keys feel when pushed down, whether they are light or heavy).  So learning on a keyboard may not prepare a person for the heavier feeling of piano keys. If a piano is too costly or large, another option is learning on a keyboard with weighted keys that feel much more similar to a piano.",0.875545,0.998824,2.998735,0.267102,0.878655,1.203772,-3.3685710430145264

What is a water hammer?,"A water hammer is a term coined to describe a phenomenon where a large volume of water, or a liquid, is forced by a forceful external impact to slam back into a smaller volume.  The forceful impact is caused by the sudden movement of air in a room or building.  Water hammering occurs when a large volume of water is suddenly forced into a smaller volume by the force of an external impact.  For example, if a large water hose is released from a tap and a person steps into that water hose, the large volume of water can be forced back into the person's hand.  The person may feel like they are being hit with a hammer.  Water hammering is used in many technologies to describe this phenomenon, including water treatment, fire suppression, and water guns.","Water hammer is the often counterintuitive result of stopping water that is in motion in a fluid system; the collective momentum of the water acts as a ""hammer"" and can create a high-pressure shockwave that damages, or destroys piping, valves, or equipment.

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,Most of the people who make Hollywood movies in Georgia are from the state of Georgia.  The film industry is very diverse in the United States due to the location of the state.  The local government is generally supportive of the film industry and encourages film makers to shoot in the state.  It is also easy to find locations and access to water for filming.,"While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

Second, vary the lighting conditions. Revisit your familiar photo spots at different hours - during the sunrise, sunset, at noon, in pitch darkness and of course, during the golden hours when the world around you embraces that warm glow.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

Write a brief poem about cultures,"Travelling in a foreign land is definitely a different experience than the one in your own country.  Each culture has its own customs and traditions.  The amount of food you will eat, the time you will eat it, and the way it is prepared will all vary.  Many of the food items you eat in a foreign land are similar to those you will eat at home.  This is because the origin of the food comes from one country and travels to the other.  

Chinese cuisine is a great example of a food that is very similar to its originating country.  The Chinese also like to eat spicy food, and they like their food to be very flavorful and full of flavor.  The Chinese cuisine emphasizes the use of pork, and the spicy food is a big part of the Chinese culture.  That is why most Chinese restaurants have a number of different dishes that are very spicy.

The American cuisine is very different from the Chinese cuisine.  The American cuisine is very sweet, and it is usually sweeter than the Chinese cuisine.  There are also a lot more vegetables in the American cuisine than the Chinese cuisine.  The American dishes also tend to be very filling, and they are usually very flavorful.  

There are a lot of different cultures in the world.  Take a look at your own backyard and see what it is like.  If you take a walk around your property, you will see that there are different cultures there.  These cultures include the African culture, the African American culture, the Hispanic culture, the Hispanic American culture, and the Asian culture.  To have a good understanding of all of these different cultures, you will have to go to all of these different places.  

Learning a foreign language is a fun way to learn about these different cultures.  It is also a good way to connect with other people from the different cultures.  You can also bring snacks and drinks that are from these different cultures.  You can also look at the different art styles of these different cultures, and you can also learn about the different religions.","I come from everywhere

2.  You can use a lantern.  A lantern has a battery powered light.  This will take longer to heat up but it is also very easy to set up.  The only downside is that you need to have a lantern for each person.

Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter
Step 2.   Build a small tepee shape with the dry kindle and dry small logs.    I would recommend adding paper with the kindle to assist in starting the fire.
Step 3.  Stack larger sticks around the teepee structure in a square formation.   Build up multiple levels, so the square structue is higher than the teepee.   This will help the fire expand and spread to the surrounding structure.

What is William Shakespeare's greatest play?,William Shakespeare's greatest play is Hamlet,"There is no common agreement on which play written by William Shakespeare is the greatest. In total, William Shakespeare wrote approximately 39 plays, each of which can be broadly categorized into three main groups: histories, comedies and tragedies. Henry V and Richard III are regarded amongst his finest histories, both featuring an English king as their eponymous character. The Tempest and A Midsummer Night's Dream are considered to be amongst his best comedies; whilst tragedies were arguably Shakespeare's greatest genre - Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar and King Lear are all amongst his finest contributions to this field. Of these, Romeo and Juliet is often considered to be the greatest love story ever written, and Hamlet is widely regarded as one of the most important analyses of the human condition. William Shakespeare's plays are widely believed to be amongst the greatest ever written, and to this day are regularly performed around the world.",0.897757,0.819884,0.995307,0.371463,0.889694,0.794821,-2.993455410003662
Explain the best way to swing a golf iron compared to a golf driver.,"A golf iron is a club that allows the golfer to hit the ball from the ground with a swing that is on the same plane as the swing of a driver.  The golf iron is designed to be hit with a relatively straight arm that does not require much swing speed at impact.  A driver requires a very fast swing speed at impact, which is the only way to hit the ball as far as a golf iron.  A golf iron is designed to be used in a way that the golfer does not have to change their arm position to hit the ball, unlike a driver.  This allows the golfer to hit the ball from a position of strength that is similar to the position they would be in if they were hitting a driver.  Beginners typically use a less powerful driver to learn how to swing the iron correctly.  They start off with a low-iron club and work up to a driver that they feel is within their strength range in order to learn how to hit the ball with a straight swing and without changing their body position.  This is a very important phase of learning golf because it allows the golfer to not only hit the ball well, but also to make the swing plane as close to the plane of a driver as possible.","When hitting an iron you want to make a downward striking motion in the grass. The driver is more of a sweeping motion through the ball. Overall, shorten the back swing on the driver and it will help gain control.",0.817777,0.999653,7.988854,0.993538,0.864721,2.332909,-3.380528450012207

What and how should you feed your baby?,Baby food is a must for each feeding. There are many types of baby food and they need to be carefully chosen so that the baby gets the nutrients that it needs. The type of food also affects how much the baby will eat. The simplest way is to buy baby food premade.

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids.

Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.

You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes.

The first team was formed in 1859 and the first game was played in 1871.  The sport was introduced to England in 1874 and the United States in 1876.

In 1868, George Washington Carver, a black farmer from rural Texas, invented baseball and began to play for the Carthage Grays. The Carthage Grays were a black baseball team. After winning the first baseball game on February 16, 1869, Carver became known as the ""father of baseball"". Carver's team, which included his family and friends, was a force to be reckoned with in the early days of the sport. At his request, the Carver family's name was changed to ""Grays"" and the team was renamed to ""Carver's Grays"".

The game evolved from a game between African American farmers to a more widespread sport in the United States, and by the early 1900s was played on major league level by the Boston Beaneaters, the Philadelphia Phillies, and the Brooklyn Robins. The game spread throughout the world after the first World Series in 1903, when the Boston Beaneaters won the title.

In the 1920s the sport was introduced to Japan and Korea, where it was called Goose Gossage's Baseball.  The sport became popular in the US in the 1930s through the efforts of the Negro Leagues, and in the 1940s and 1950s, the Negro American League and the Cotton Bowl, which was known as the Negro Leagues' World Series.  The Negro American League was the first black league to have a winning season, in 1950.  The Negro Leagues and Negro American League played a total of nine games.

In the 1960s the game was introduced to Latin America and Africa, where it is known as baseball and is played by millions of people all over the world.

There are about 400 professional baseball teams in the US with 23 Major League teams and one minor league team. Major league baseball teams play in the World Series, and the World Series is the championship of the major leagues.
","Although the history of baseball cannot be determined with great precision, it is said that the game originated in England during the 1700s. The first official game to be played in North America took place in 1838 in Beachville, Ontario, Canada and in 1846 the first official game took place in the United States. The original rules of baseball, called the Knickerbocker Rules"" were established in 1845 and formed the basis of the rules of modern baseball that evolved over the following century.",0.864272,0.998988,18.188442,0.911869,0.967845,4.386283,-4.136265754699707

Why do so many people say it is special to be a grandparent?,"Because grandparent is the word for the time when you take a break from parenting for a while. When you are a parent, you can do everything for your kids. When you are a grandparent, you can give your kids love and care.","Many people say that being a grandparent is special.  They say it is special being a grandparent for a variety of reasons.  One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, ""I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.""

What are the unethical behaviors in the corporate world? Illustrate with an example.,"- Manipulation of employees medical records
- Failing to treat employees with respect
- Harassing, bullying, or otherwise negatively impacting employees","Boeing 737 Max 

 
Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual.

How do I open a pomegranate without exploding?,"It's best to consume pomegranates on their own, without any other fruit or juice. To do this, you will need a pomegranate armloader. The following is how to open a pomegranate without using an armloader:

1. First, you will need to remove the seeds from the pomegranate. This can be done by removing a thin layer of the pomegranate from the pit with a small knife.
2. Carefully cut the remaining pomegranate in half. You want the seeds to be on the outside of the pomegranate, so that you can remove the seeds without contaminating the juice.
3. Next, cut the pomegranate into segments, and put them in a bowl.
4. Pour the juice from the pomegranate into a larger bowl.
5. Mash the pomegranate seeds with a fork to break them up a bit.
6. Finally, you will need to add sugar, to taste, to the pomegranate juice.
7. Mix the pomegranate seeds, juice, and sugar together.
8. Pour the pomegranate juice into a glass that has been coated with pomegranate syrup, or you can use an existing syrup-coated glass.
9. Enjoy!","The trick is to open the pomegranate in a bowl of water. This way, the water will contain any bursts of juice from the pomegranate seeds.",0.793508,0.991078,13.060403,0.844508,0.849488,3.307797,-4.4431891441345215
What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?,"The right hemisphere controls reasoning, language and spatial abilities, and the left hemisphere controls the body.","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.862422,0.98593,0.997369,0.112436,0.846474,0.760926,-3.907421588897705
What is a bond in finance?,"Bonds are a form of debt where the issuer promises to pay the buyer an amount of money in the future. The payment is made based on an interest rate agreed between the parties. Bond prices are influenced by a number of factors, the most important of which is the expected inflation rate in the future.","In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stock",0.949319,0.995037,2.955462,0.823451,0.944591,1.333572,-2.96356463432312

A football training session can be planned to cover topics such as warm up, team building, team work, passing, defending, marking, playing the ball, running, passing the ball, tackling, passing the ball, defending the goal, running the ball, and finishing the game.

When planning a football training session, it is important to set a realistic time frame, and to create a clear ""to do"" list for the team. The team should be assigned a specific role in the game plan, and should be provided with specific instructions for the role on the day of the game. For example, if the team is playing as a defense, the instructions could include:

- Warm up: The team should warm up for 5-10 minutes to ensure that they are as fresh as possible. The warm up should include a specific warm up routine that has the team practicing the skill in question (for example, running a route, passing the ball, tackling, marking, etc.).

- Team building: The team should spend 5-10 minutes on team building. This should include the team having fun, and learning about each other. The team should spend time on team building activities that will help the team become a cohesive unit. For example:

- Team warm up: The team should spend time on team warm up activities, such as running a route, playing the ball, passing the ball, tackling, marking, etc.

- Warm up: The team should spend 5-10 minutes on a warm up routine, such as running, passing, tackling, marking, etc.

- Socials and celebrations: The team should spend 5-10 minutes on a celebration or social activity, such as having a team photo, a photo booth, or a post game party.

- Team role assignment: The team should spend 5-10 minutes on a role assignment, which should include the team role that they will play in the game. For example, if the team is playing as a defense, the role assignment could include:

- Defensive player: The team should spend time on defensive player role assignments, which should include learning the defensive role of each player. For example, the defensive player should learn the defensive responsibilities of the defensive players.

Does a difference in prediction outcomes between two ethnic/gender groups from a credit scoring algorithm constitute a bias in the data collection process or the algorithm itself?,There is no bias in the credit scoring algorithm when it comes to prediction outcomes.,"I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in",0.870413,0.970348,0.998287,0.027587,0.861016,0.74553,-2.6741228103637695

"You are a young citizen of a developing country. Write a letter in less than 150 words to a newspaper, highlighting your concern over incorrect disposal of biomedical waste and to spread awareness of the same.","Dear Editor,

It is with great disappointment that we read about illegal disposal of waste in developing countries. We, as a community, are deeply concerned about this issue. We depend on the waste management facilities built by the government and are aware of its importance.

In order to ensure the safety and security of medical waste, it is important to ensure that the waste is properly identified, collected and disposed. However, when this is not the case, there can be serious consequences. The extreme example of this is the chemical contamination of the water supply.

The illegal disposal of medical waste is a serious issue. It is imperative that all countries in the world develop and implement appropriate legislation to control the illegal disposal of medical waste.

It is vital that the hazardous waste management stream is separated from the legal stream. This will ensure that the hazardous waste is disposed of in a safe and environmentally sustainable manner.

I would like to take this opportunity to request that you consider taking this matter up with your country's federal ministry of environment and natural resources and request that it develop and implement appropriate legislation to ensure the safety and security of medical waste and prevent the illegal disposal of medical waste.","The Covid19 pandemic has changed the lives of all human beings, and has driven massive consumption of personal protective equipment worldwide. People have adapted to wearing face masks as a 'new normal'. At the same time, the disposal of biomedical waste is a major concern, especially in developing countries with limited resources. Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms. 

If not scientifically handled and disposed, it could cause serious risk not just to human health, but also pose a serious threat to terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?,"While music composition is considered a broad field of study, it is typically broken down into many smaller disciplines such as harmony, rhythm, tempo, and timbre. These sub-disciplines are then broken down further to create the general theory required to compose music.","Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

What is geodesy?,"Geodesy is the study of the movements of the earth's surface and the determination of its shape, location, and size.  The name comes from the Greek word geodesy, meaning measurement.  The study of geodesy began in ancient China and Egypt, and was cultivated by the ancient Greeks.  The first instrument used for geodesy was the trigonometrical quadrant.  It was developed by Archimedes (287-212 BC) and was the first instrument to be used in geodetic work.  The trigonometrical quadrant was used to determine the length of the earth's ellipsoid, and the angle subtended at the focus of the telescope.  The trigonometrical quadrant remains in use to this day.  The first successful geodesy survey was made by the Spanish explorer Juan de Fuca, who sailed around Vancouver Island in 1792 and 1793.  The first GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite was launched in 1999, and it was used to determine the location of other satellites.  The first satellite used for civilian purposes was the Explorer 1, launched by the US Air Force on February 1, 1958.  Explorers 2 and 3 were launched in 1960 and 1962, respectively.  The first civilian GPS receiver was the first civilian satellite (C/Aglio) launched in 1992.  The first GPS satellite was launched in 1993 and has since provided precise location data to the public.  The first GPS receiver was the first commercial GPS receiver, which was launched in 1996 and was manufactured by TomTom.","Geodesy is the science of measuring and representing the geometry, gravity, and spatial orientation of the Earth in temporally varying 3D. It is called planetary geodesy when studying other astronomical bodies, such as planets or circumplanetary systems.

Should I buy a gravel bike or a down country mountain bike?,"If you have no experience riding dirt bikes, gravel bikes are a great choice for your first bike. Dedicated gravel bikes outperform dirt bikes with their speed and agility. Down country mountain bikes are also good choices for beginners. Some important things to be aware of when choosing a gravel bike or a mountain bike are you intended use, your riding experience, and your riding skills.","Although there is reasonable overlap in what you can use gravel and downcountry bikes for, the answer her largely depends on what you plan to do the most of and if trail riding will be important for you. Gravel bikes are great for covering offroad miles more efficiently and long days in the saddle both on road or offroad. However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!). However, downcountry bikes are usually heavier but the full suspension and geometry makes them less efficient compared to a gravel bike.",0.889209,0.999149,3.991079,0.473413,0.915502,1.45367,-3.767057418823242

What are the reasons why quantum theory is considered do difficult to understand,"Quantum mechanics has two main difficulties which make it difficult to understand.

3. The mathematical theories are all at an advanced level and few examples of how to actually apply them appear in text books.
4. The theory itself says that you cannot know the intermediate steps in any quantum process, you can know where you start and predict where you might end up but not how you get form one to the other.

What are some signs and symptoms of Type 2 Diabetes?,"Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, is a metabolic disorder that is caused by the body's inability to regulate the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. The two main ways that cells in the body can use the sugar in the bloodstream are through the liver and the kidneys. People with type 2 diabetes have too much blood sugar for the body to use.

To control the amount of sugar in the bloodstream, the body breaks down and absorbs glucose from the blood. Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50.

People with type 2 diabetes may also have signs and symptoms of high blood sugar, including:

Frequent urination or excessive urination
Dry or persistent mouth sores
Blurred vision
Numbness in the hands or feet
Extreme thirst
Extreme hunger
Nausea or vomiting
A feeling of fullness in the stomach
Headaches
Chest pains
Muscle weakness
Vision changes
Coughing
Swelling of the feet or ankles
Blindness","The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss. Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue. Other symptoms may include loss of taste. Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.

Why is a meme compared to a gene?,"A meme is a pattern of cultural behavior. Like a gene, a meme is passed down from generation to generation. Unlike a gene, however, memes are not passed on in the exact same way that genes are. Instead, they are transmitted by reproducing copies of the meme, called memes. A meme is passed down from one generation to another only when it can be passed along, which means that it has to be a part of the cultural behavior of a specific generation.

Since memes can be passed down for generations, they are a very powerful force in shaping the culture and society of a population. In the early stages of human civilization, most types of cultural behavior were passed down through word of mouth, so the transmission of a meme was slow and unpredictable. However, with the advent of written language, social media, and mass media, memes can be passed down more quickly and more predictably than before.","A meme is compared to a gene because it can self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures similar to that of a gene.",0.822666,0.999286,7.95352,0.950174,0.852382,2.315605,-3.3657124042510986

Give me a list of the key elements of telecommunications developed over time,"Telecommunications has evolved from its earliest days as a device for transmitting and receiving voice information to a network of interconnected devices that enables the exchange of information across a wider range of services and applications.

The first telephones were originally developed to facilitate the exchange of voice telegrams.  The first modern telephones were developed by Alexander Graham Bell in the 1890s.  Bell's telephone was the first device to send and receive electrical signals from a far-away location via wire.

Bell's telephone was the first to use the telephone network.  Bell and his colleague Charles Everett Fisher developed the first transatlantic telephone call in 1894.  The telephone network was first used in the US in the early 1900s for business and personal use.  The first regular telephone service was launched in 1918 with the establishment of the Bell System.

The first public telephone exchanges were built in the 1920s.  Telephone service expanded afterwards, and replaced the telegraph system in the 1940s.  The first public wireless telephone service was launched in the 1930s.  The first public wireless telephone network was built in the 1940s.

The telephone network was revolutionised in the 1960s through the research of Alexander Graham Bell and his colleague Charles Everett Fisher.  They developed the first asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching system, which enabled telecommunications organisations to use telephone networks for transmitting and receiving both data and voice.  The first public ATM network was launched in the 1960s.

The first global telecommunications network, the European Special Communications Network (ESCONet), was launched in 1971.  The first commercial and business-oriented global telecommunications network, the Teledesic network, was launched in 1973.

The first digital telecommunications network was launched in the 1980s.  This network was based on the ATM switching system and enabled telecommunications organisations to use digital data for both voice and data transmissions.  The first broadband telecommunications network was launched in the 1990s.  This network enabled the transmission of voice, data and video services over long distances.  The first public data service was launched in the 1990s.

The first public internet service was launched in the early 2000s.  This network, based on the ATM switching system, enabled the transmission of internet protocol (IP) packets over long distances.  The first company that offered internet service was Alcatel-Lucent in France.

The first global wireless network was launched in the 1990s.  This network enabled the transmission of data and video","Beacons, telegraph, telephone, radio, television, thermionic valves, computer networks and the Internet",0.578288,0.997807,26.268735,0.950028,0.634096,5.885791,-4.297028064727783
What is a good score to shoot in golf?,"In golf, a good score is one where you get to hit every green in a round with exactly the same amount of strokes. If you get to hit the green at least 6 times in a round, that is considered a good score. It is also important to note that the scoring system relies on the number of strokes you manage to play on each green, and not divvying up the outcomes based on which hole you play.","A good score in golf highly depends on the skill of the player. A professional can easily shoot under par by many strokes. Conversely, an amateur player can shoot anywhere from a few shots over par to over 30 shots over par. A player can also use tools that calculate their handicap, which will show them on average how much they shoot over or under par.

Explain gravity,"An object exerts force on the Earth, causing it to move around.","Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.906541,0.925617,0.992197,0.248113,0.902083,0.79491,-3.4433786869049072

Brainstorm reasons for and against taking a daily low-dose aspirin.,"The low-dose aspirin (Lack) trial demonstrated that daily low-dose aspirin (as low as 75 mg) was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, the trial was not placebo-controlled. There are a number of reasons why taking LACK daily is controversial. Low-dose aspirin does interact with other drugs and foods, so the benefits of LACK are not necessarily due to its antiplatelet effect. LACK is expensive, and its use could be challenging for some patients with cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hyperlipidemia). In addition, there is some evidence that low-dose aspirin can increase the risk of stomach cancer, so there is concern that taking LACK daily might increase the risk of stomach cancer. A new review shows that taking LACK daily could increase the risk of myocardial infarction.","According to Berkeley Wellness, there’s evidence that a daily aspirin “protects people already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD).” However, there is insufficient evidence that a daily low-dose aspirin is as effective for primary prevention; it is not as necessarily effective for people who have “not been diagnosed with CVD.” Additionally, high BMI may also alter the way aspirin is metabolized, further complicating the data.

What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?,"The main functions that affect the correct exposure of an image on a DSLR camera are aperture, shutter speed, ISO setting and a filter.","If a DSLR camera is not set to 'Automatic' mode, there are 3 primary functions that need to be considered when deciding on the correct exposure for your image.
1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.94079,0.991573,0.997539,0.045052,0.934464,0.781884,-2.740375518798828

Does extended screen time cause speech delay in children?,"Extended screen time (ESE) is defined as more than 2 hours per day for kids. Long screen time is associated with poor school performance. It is widely known that kids who watch TV for a long time experience speech delay. It is also known that TV viewing is positively associated with language use. However, the causal relationship between TV viewing and speech delay is not clear. To examine the causal relationship between ESE and speech delay, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study. The longitudinal cohort study included 9,929 children from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We conducted longitudinal analyses using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), which was administered at baseline and 6 years later. Children who watched ESE for 6 or more hours per day were more likely to have speech delay. The association remained significant after adjusting for the CBCL internalizing problems score, which is a proxy of speech delay. These results suggest that ESE is associated with speech delay. However, it is unclear why the association is observed only in the longitudinal cohort study. Further investigations are needed to clarify the causal relationship between ESE and speech delay.",There is no definite proof that extended screen time cause speech delay in children because there are contradicting study results.,0.431219,0.997861,12.699599,0.871762,0.548629,3.109814,-3.660922050476074

Do aliens exist?,"Scientists have been theorizing about life beyond Earth for decades.  The possibility of life on another planet is very real.  While many scientists are uncertain about the likelihood of life on other planets, others are certain of it.  The first step in answering this question is to determine what defines life in the first place.  Specifically, what is life?  The scientific definition of life is a self-sustaining biological entity capable of independent existence, reproduction, and diversity.  This definition may seem broad, but it is not completely comprehensive.  Based on this definition, does life exist?  If it does, then it is a living thing.","Although there is no definitive evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life, pictures and videos of UFOs, although of low quality, have proven to many people that not only does extraterrestrial life exist, but it is visiting Earth regularly.",0.818933,0.99333,5.502367,0.985996,0.8723,1.834585,-4.5655622482299805

What steps can I take to avoid getting hit by a falling window from a skyscraper while walking about in downtown during high winds?,The most immediate step you can take to avoid being hit by a falling window is to move away from the building as soon as the building is clear of the building. This can be difficult to do in downtown during high winds and snow. Another option is to move to a higher floor and walk down the main street. The main street is usually clear of the falling window.,"Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting hit by falling windows detached from tall building by strong winds from cyclones or tornadoes: 
1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. 
3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. 
4. You might think that being inside a car would be a safe option, but vehicles are notoriously dangerous places to be in during high winds because of their susceptibility to being blown over or blown away or for their windows to explode.",0.008623,0.997725,3.980994,0.300766,0.011928,1.060007,-2.658651351928711

There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias.

"Let’s solve the following math problem. Each rabbit has 4 feets and each duck has 2 feets. If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?","25 heads * 88 feets = 20,752

We can solve the problem by multiplying 25 heads by 88 feets:
20 heads * 88 feets = 8,912

We can also solve the problem using the sum of two fractions.
Bunnies have 4 feets
Ducks have 2 feets
Sum of Bunnies and Ducks is 8,912

We can also solve the problem by adding the two fractions together.
8,912 + 8,912 = 20,752

We can also solve the problem by substituting in the number of rabbits and ducks.
20,752 = 25 heads * 88 feets

We can also solve the problem by multiplying the number of rabbits by the number of ducks.
25 heads * 88 feets = 88 rabbits

We can also solve the problem by dividing by two.
88/2 = 44 rabbits

We can also solve the problem by subtracting the number of ducks from the number of rabbits.
44 - 88 = 36 rabbits","Let’s use equations to solve it! 
Let the number of ducks be X and the number of rabbits be Y.
We have X + Y = 25 and 2X + 4Y = 88.
Simplifying the first equation, we get Y = 25 - X
Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88
Which means 2X = 100 – 88 = 12, thus X = 6.
We substitute back into the first equation, we have Y = 25 - 6 = 19.

Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.947509,0.994834,0.998988,0.023844,0.942079,0.781451,-2.8272032737731934

Its international governing body is the Cricket World Cup, a tournament organized every 4 years. It is also the only true international team sport, as no other sport allows any country the opportunity to participate in the same tournament more than once.

The sport originated in the Indian subcontinent, and the first recorded Test match was played in India in 1757, followed by a game between England and South Africa in 1879. Cricket was played in the United Kingdom from 1817 until 1888, when the game was banned during the 1st world war. The game was re-established in Australia in 1930, and then in England in 1948. The next World Cup was played in Australia in 1975.

The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end.

How do I do a headstand?,"A headstand is a great exercise to do at home if you don't have access to a yoga or meditation class.  It will require you to hold a position for about 10 breaths.  Start in standing with your feet hip-width apart.  Widen your feet a little bit and imagine your heels are your hands.  Lower your heels down to the floor.  Keep your head and shoulders down.  Repeat this in a forward head posture.  If you want to try it while holding a ball, hold the ball between your knees and bring your knees towards your chest.  If you want to try it while holding a yoga block, hold the block between your knees and bring your knees towards your chest.  It's a great way to focus your mind and challenge your balance.  Do at least three sets of 10 with a minute of rest between each set.  You can also do it with a partner.  If you do it with a partner, make sure you are both holding the same posture at the same time.","Start in a tabletop position with your knees on the ground and your hands placed underneath your shoulders.  Draw your chin into your chest and lower the crown of your head onto the ground.  Curl your toes under and lift your knees up off the ground.  Place each knee on your tricep.  Push into the heal of your palm to lift your knees off your tricep.  With your low core deeply engaged, continue to lift your knees higher until your legs are fully extended.

What do redshifts tell astronomers?," redshifts are a way to measure the distance of a galaxy from the observer.  The farther away a galaxy is, the higher the redshift.  The farther away a galaxy is, the redder the spectrum of light emitted by that galaxy.  Therefore, by measuring the redshift of a galaxy, astronomers can determine how much closer the galaxy is to us, and how red its spectrum of light is.  One way to measure the redshift of a galaxy is to use a spectrograph, which is a device that splits the light from a galaxy into multiple beams.  The spectrograph then focuses the light from each beam on a separate sensor.  The spectrograph measures the relative intensities of the different bands of light.  The different wavelengths of light from the different bands of light give astronomers a way to determine how far away the galaxy is from us.  A high redshift galaxy has a relatively weak signal in the longer wavelengths of light, and a relatively strong signal in the shorter wavelengths of light.","Edwin Hubble discovered in the 1920s that the spectral lines of light reaching us from the universe's most distant galaxies were redshifting to areas of the electromagnetic spectrum with lower energy intensity. This allows us to confirm that the various objects in the universe are moving away from us and from one another. The faster a galaxy moves away from the observer, the further it is from the observer. This phenomenon is interpreted as proof of the universe's expansion and the Big Bang.",0.733486,0.999216,7.932718,0.976872,0.775523,2.283563,-3.5692138671875

When was the Sydney Opera House formally opened,"The Sydney Opera House was formally opened on 9 November 1875 by the Governor General, Prince Alfred, and was designed by the architectural firm of Paterson and Pirie. It is the second-largest building in Sydney, after the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is located on the foreshore of Sydney Cove at the northwest corner of George Street and Circular Quay, Sydney.

The Sydney Opera House is one of the most recognisable buildings in Sydney and one of the most recognisable landmarks in the city. It was designed by the Sydney architects Paterson and Pirie with the assistance of Charles F. Bird and L.G. Paterson. The Sydney Opera House is located in Sydney Harbour, on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour at the northwest corner of George Street and Circular Quay, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The Sydney Opera House is the largest multi-purpose arena in the world. It has a seating capacity of approximately 20,000. It is named after the Italian soprano Dame Nellie Melba who was the first British-born Australian soprano to sing at the Sydney Opera House. The Sydney Opera House is part of the Sydney Entertainment and Convention Centre.

The Sydney Opera House is one of the Sydney landmarks, a listed Sydney Heritage structure, and is classified as an Australian heritage-listed building.

The Sydney Opera House is frequently the subject of artwork and photographs, and is also a popular tourist destination. It was the subject of the 1971 book The Sydney Opera House: The Architecture and the People in the Life of an Icon by the architectural historian David Brewer.

The Sydney Opera House was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 28 May 2007, and is now the most-visited tourist destination in the world.","The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.

Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

What is the difference between solar power and hydrogen fuel cell?  What are the advantages of hydrogen?,"Solar power is the use of the sun's energy to generate electricity.  The sun has an energy output which is constantly changing, however the amount of energy that we can capture from the sun varies day to day, and season to season.  In the summer we will get more energy from the sun but in the winter we may not get enough energy to power our homes.  No matter the time of day, the amount of energy that we can get is finite.  In order to achieve this goal we use fossil fuels including gasoline, coal, natural gas, etc.  This fuels uses up a finite amount of energy and produces a carbon footprint.  Hydrogen can be produced from water using heat from the sun, and is a clean energy source that does not produce a carbon footprint.  The energy from hydrogen is very clean, and many people are looking into using hydrogen in vehicles, but the main reason we are using fossil fuels is to generate power.  This is because we do not control how much energy we are getting from the sun in the summer, and how much energy we are getting in the winter.  We have to use a power grid to generate the energy that we need.  Hydrogen is a clean energy source that can be used in vehicles, but fossil fuels are still the main source of power.",Solar captures the harvesting of the sun while hydrogen is the osmosis process of extracting the hydrogen cells to create energy.  Hydrogen allows for a more consistent energy source while also enabling higher load generation over solar.,0.769187,0.999145,10.225684,0.943759,0.803713,2.748298,-3.5196988582611084

This information is then aggregated by a marketing analyst to summarize the overall sentiment of the customer base. This aggregated information is used to target marketing campaigns and develop recommendations for product improvements and pricing. Voice of Customer data is generally regarded as more accurate than that gathered from surveys or focus group discussions. The voice of the customer is generally considered as more representative of the sentiments of the target market than any one person speaking on their own behalf. However, this data can be collected by a variety of different sources and the response rate for the questions generally ranges from 30% to 90% for products and services offered on the market. Thus, the voice of the customer data is not representative of the entire customer base and it is important to consider sampling bias when analyzing the results of such studies. Sampling bias occurs when a subset of the population is systematically underrepresented and the results of the analysis of this subset of the population are therefore not reflective of the entire population. For example, a customer segment that is less responsive to a marketing campaign could be systematically underrepresented in the voice of the customer data, which would result in the analysis of this segment of the population being less informative than if the analysis were based on the entire customer population. This is an example of a type of sampling bias that can occur when an analysis is based on a subset of the population and the analysis is therefore not as representative of the entire population. The same is true for data analysis of other types such as telephone surveys, which can also be conducted more cost-effectively by automated telephone systems.","Recently I bought a TV from Amazon after extensive research and analysis. The TV manufacturer promptly followed up two weeks after the purchase. The post-purchase experience survey had questions like the following: 


·  	Did you buy it from a store/online? 

·  	Are you satisfied with your order? 

·  	Which store did you visit? 

·  	Was the self-assembly instructions easy to follow? 

·  	What other items would you consider purchasing from our brand? 

  
The above questions were too generic from the TV manufacturer, and they missed the mark in identifying me as a persona and my buying criteria. I bought the TV for my basement as a secondary TV, and I picked a TV brand with standard features to be cost-effective. Below are a few sampling biases from the survey

Tell me about the inversion in postcolonial theory,"In recent years, postcolonial theory has become a hot topic in academia, with a variety of studies focused on an understanding of the post-colonial condition, the nature of the social contract, the nature of the subject, and the relation between knowledge and power. Postcolonial theory is commonly characterized as an intellectual tradition that has grown up out of the experiences of the global South.

The theoretical foundation of postcolonial theory is very much rooted in the work of the French theorist Frantz Fanon (1925–1961). Fanon's work is particularly influential on the development of postcolonial theory, since he argued that the structures of colonialism were hidden from the colonized, and that these structures gave rise to the logic of modernity, a term coined by Fanon. In his seminal essay ""The Wretched of the Earth"", Fanon argued that the culture of the colonized was incapable of understanding the oppression it was experiencing, and that this cultural rigidity and lack of emancipatory potential was responsible for an endless cycle of resistance, subjugation, and hegemony of the colonized.

Since its inception, postcolonial theory has been criticized for its Eurocentric outlook, for the tendency to emphasize the experiences of the colonized, and for its focus on the Western context. It is also often characterized as being very Eurocentric.

Among the most significant authors in the postcolonial tradition, to whom many refer to as the ""pioneers"", are Edward W. Said (1928–2003), César H. Alexiou (b. 1948), and Mumia Abu-Jamal (b. 1947).

The focus of the postcolonial movement has shifted over the years, with the rise of critical race theories, the resurgence of the human sciences, and the rise of postmodernism.

The ""Third Way"" perspective, associated with Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, and Louis Althusser, has been described by some as the ""third word"" of postcolonial theory. According to this approach, decolonization is not the end of the story, but rather a starting point for a renewed and more postcolonial analysis.","The term derives from studies of modalities of resistance by the Subaltern Studies school, but reflects concerns pervasive from the earliest days of post- and anti-colonial writing.

Once the thermostat has warmed up, it is recommended to turn the water heater on and see if the water heater is producing hot water.  If the water is still too cold, it is recommended to turn the water heater off and try again.  If the water is now hot, it is likely the thermostat is to blame.  If so, it is recommended to have your thermostat replaced.","If your gas water heater is not working, first check to see if:

 - Is the water heater leaking? If so, turn off the water and gas to the heater, and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 - Do you smell gas around your heater? If so, you likely have a gas leak--turn off the gas line to the heater and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 
If neither of these are issues, check to see if the pilot light for you heater is lit. This is likely hidden behind a panel or door on the bottom of the front of the heater.  If the pilot light is not lit, follow the instructions to try re-lighting it.

If the pilot light does not light or continues to go out after heating the water, the thermal coupling on the water heater likely needs to be replaced. Contact a plumber to have this replaced.

Generally speaking, traditional tank-based, gas water heaters have a lifetime of 10-15 years. If the age water heater is within this range, you may want to prepare for replacing the water heater soon.",0.831201,0.998425,5.920354,0.832469,0.881397,1.892769,-3.4693334102630615

What characterizes turbulent flow,"Turbulence is a self-organized process resulting in flow instabilities. It is characterized by a large-scale velocity gradient, large-scale vorticity, and a large-scale velocity divergence.  

These instabilities are the result of the interaction of the velocity and the vorticity of the flow.  The vorticity of the flow is the rate at which the velocity and the density of the fluid change directions.  It describes the tendency of the fluid to rotate or twist around itself.  The velocity of the fluid is the rate at which a fluid element changes direction.  The direction of the velocity vector is relative to the direction of the flow (i.e. the direction of the vorticity vector).  

The large-scale velocity gradient is a measure of the magnitude of the velocity.  It is equivalent to the rate of change of the velocity with respect to distance from the source.  Large-scale vorticity is a measure of the magnitude of the vorticity.  It is equivalent to the rate of change of the vorticity with respect to distance from the source.  Large-scale velocity divergence is a measure of the magnitude of the velocity divergence.  It is equivalent to the rate of change of the velocity divergence with respect to distance from the source.  

A turbulent flow is a flow, or stream, that is characterized by large-scale velocity gradients and large-scale vorticity.

The flow is turbulent if the following criteria are met:

Velocity gradient: At any point in the flow, the magnitude of the velocity gradient, |∇u|, is greater than a threshold value. This threshold value depends on the length scale over which the flow is turbulent, the Reynolds number, and the viscosity of the fluid. The value of the Reynolds number is defined as R=νL, whereν is the fluid's kinematic viscosity, L is the length scale over which the flow is turbulent, and ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.

Vorticity: The magnitude of the vorticity, |ω|, at any point in the flow, is greater than a threshold value, |ω| greater than a threshold value that depends on the length scale over which the flow is turbulent, and the viscosity of the fluid. The value of the viscosity of the fluid is defined as νL, where L is the length scale over which the flow is turbulent, and ν is the viscosity of the fluid.

What's a romatic poem about the universe and time?,"A Romantic poem is a poetic composition that is about the universe, or a description of the universe, its physical and philosophical properties, and the effects that it has on the individual.

In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994. About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman and the FSF started by creating utilities for the operating system first.

What is the history of coffee?,"Coffee is a drink originating from the coffee plant (coffee is a bean), which is grown in the Cerrado region of Brazil. It is one of the oldest drinks in the world. The word coffee comes from the Arabic word ""kahf"" meaning grind or sift.","Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam.

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?","The two phrases, “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”, are used to describe the consistency of the opinions of a given set of people.  The consistency of opinions typically depends on the extent to which opinions are held by members of the same demographic or social class, and the extent to which the opinions are held in response to the same events.  The two phrases are not to be confused.","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.

What is the best way to get faster at running long distances?,"Running long distances can be a daunting task.  There are many different training methods that can be employed to make the distance run more enjoyable and less of a chore.  One method that has been shown to improve running speed is interval training.  An interval training workout consists of running for a short period of time (often 1-2 minutes) and then immediately returning to running at a faster pace for another short period of time.  For example, you would run for 30 seconds, then run for 30 seconds at a faster pace, then run for 30 seconds at a slower pace.  This cycle is repeated over and over, with the goal being to have the legs feel exhausted, but still be able to run at a faster pace for 30 seconds.  Interval training has been shown to improve running speed by increasing the number of fast-twitch muscle fibers in the body, which enables the body to use more oxygen and run for longer periods of time.  Interval training can also make running more enjoyable by lengthening the time between runs, which can make the long runs feel more enjoyable.  Interval training has also been shown to decrease the amount of time it takes to recover between runs, which can make the long runs feel easier and more enjoyable.","To become faster at running requires practicing a lot of long slow distance running mixed in with occasional interval training.

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.

Who is the greatest musical theatre composer of all time?,"The one person that comes to mind that has had the most influence on musical theatre composers is Stephen Schwartz.

His work with ""Godspell"" and ""The Sound of Music"" also have a place in musical theatre composers' musical theatre repertoire.  His work with ""The Lion King"" has also had a massive influence on musical theatre composers.","While art is subjective, there are a few luminary composers who have made significant contributions to musical theatre and whose work has stood the test of time. One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having ""hummable"" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with ""Send in",0.610364,0.995151,4.961059,0.732661,0.63837,1.587521,-3.7541236877441406
What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,"Good hitting is often measured by the number of hits and runs scored.  A good hitter will approach 100 runs or 100 at bats to reach base.  A good hitter will have a batting average above .300.  A good hitter will have at least 30 doubles, 30 triples, 10 homeruns, and 15 stolen bases.  A good hitter will have a walk rate of at least 10% and strike out rate of at least 15%.  Good hitting is an important part of a baseball or softball player.  A good hitter typically has the skill and tools to play the game at an elite level.","There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. 

There are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.",0.833377,0.994956,6.963696,0.902817,0.860908,2.111151,-4.043903827667236

For example, using the data from the study, a researcher may develop a new treatment protocol for a patient with a specific medical condition.

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.",0.884107,0.994792,2.980531,0.772558,0.877674,1.301933,-2.730750560760498

Write a short story about a person who discovers a hidden room in their house. The story should include a plot twist and a clear resolution at the end.,"The story begins with a man named Pedro and his wife, Maria. Maria is a busy woman and has many responsibilities. One day as she is walking through their neighborhood, she saw a large grassy area that she thought was perfect for a playroom for their son. She decided to go inside to check it out, and once inside, it was exactly as she had imagined. It was dark and the walls were lined with shelves filled with toys and books. It felt like home. Maria was very happy. She had always imagined a playroom like this for her son. She was overjoyed, but then she spotted something odd. The room was lined with doors on all four walls. She lingered for a moment in the room before her curiosity got the better of her. Opening one of the doors, she found a dark and narrow hallway. She was confused. She knew that in her house, there were rooms located in the hallway. She had no idea that there were hidden rooms in the house! She was just surprised that such a room could be so small. She had never thought of it. She walked down the hallway and began to explore. It was dark and narrow, and it was freezing cold, so she stopped to take a look around. She saw a door on the middle wall. Opening it, she found a small room. It was only about the size of a closet. She had never seen a room like this before, and she was intrigued. She thought she might find a secret passageway or something, and she was hoping that she would find something cool. She began to explore the room, and she realized that there was a door at the back of the room. She decided to check it out. It was locked, but it was definitely worth the effort. She turned the handle and opened the door. A small elevator was hidden in the corner of the room. It was hidden in plain sight, but it was in such a small space that it took her a moment to notice it. She was so excited. She had found a hidden room! She couldn’t believe it. She walked into the elevator and found that it was empty, but that didn’t matter. She knew there was someone else in the house. She would wait for them to come home and see what was in that little room.","It was going to be a long day.

Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.

Please summarize the main argument of this paragraph from Woodrow Wilson's speech to Congress asking them to declare war on Germany.,"Woodrow Wilson is widely credited for helping to lead the United States into World War II. He spoke to the U.S. Congress on March 4, 1917 and made the case for entering World War I. He emphasized that the United States had to join the war to protect democracy and that the country's involvement could lead to a terrible loss of life. He also warned against the possibility of a major Allied victory due to the inability of the Allies to employ the combined air and naval power of a great power. After several hours of debate, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly voted to join the war on April 6, 1917.","Wilson thought neutrality was impractical, and would actually lead into America more likely being attacked by Germany because what they were doing threatened all of Western civilization. He thought the United States should enter the war on its own terms.",0.830123,0.998113,4.979159,0.421275,0.84379,1.614492,-2.8702406883239746

History of the Arches National Park creation.,"The Arches National Park was created in the years 1924 and 1925. At this time, the landscape around Moab, Utah was changing rapidly from the desert environment of the area's early inhabitants to the semi-arid environment of the present day. As a result, its inhabitants were becoming increasingly urban. The park was established to preserve this transition as well as to protect the rare rock formations present in the area.","First Humans appeared in this region during the last ice age 10000 years ago. The first settlers began in 1775 but were abandoned before 1855 when ranchers, farmers, and prospectors settled in Moab(the closest city to the Arches). The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created.

what is the difference between ARM and x86 chipsets?,"ARM and x86 are both architectures that are used in computers.  The main difference between them is that x86 has a single instruction set, but ARM has a wide variety of instruction sets.  Common instruction sets include MSA, ARM, MPCore, and NEON.  Since only one instruction set is supported, it is more efficient to execute code written for one instruction set efficiently than to execute code written for an instruction set that is not supported.  This is why x86 is more prevalent in computers, but ARM is more prevalent in mobile devices.",ARM uses Reduced Instruction Set Computing Architecture (RISC) whereas x86 uses Complex Instruction Set Computing Architecture (CISC). ARM executes single instruction per cycle whereas x86 executes complex instructions in multiple cycles. This allows softwares to be optimized for performance against ARM chipset as opposed to an 86 hardware approach to optimize. It would also be interesting to mention that ARM uses higher memory and less registers compared to x86.,0.829773,0.998836,4.946893,0.786505,0.844834,1.681368,-3.8330023288726807

What is salvation in christianity?,Salvation is receiving the gift of God's grace and grace in Jesus Christ.  Salvation in the Bible is a gift from God.  It is considered good news for those who have no hope or who have been condemned.  Those who believe in Jesus are given a new life in which they are adopted as sons and daughters of the living God.  Salvation is not something you earn but something that is given to those who believe in Jesus as their only way to heaven.  They will not find it in their actions but in their faith in Jesus.  If you do not have faith and you do not believe in Jesus as your Lord and Savior then you will go to hell.,"Salvation in christianity is the redemption of human beings from the consequences of their sins through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Jesus's death is counted as the payment for the sin of all mankind, as recorded by Paul in his letters. This salvation is open to everyone, not just the jews. Anyone who believes that Jesus died for their sins and rose again receives the salvation that God has to offer.",0.72119,0.997947,6.985861,0.797522,0.759916,2.052487,-3.7354981899261475

What is a sonnet?,"Sonnet is a poetic form. A sonnet is a four-line poem, each line rhyming. The first two lines are called the *head rhymes, and the second two lines are called *tail rhymes. The last two lines are called the *main rhymes, and they are always rhyme with the first two lines. In the first couplet, the poet begins with the first line, then continues on with the second line, and ends with the third line.

The four lines in a sonnet are always in rhyme with each other, and the lines in a couplet are always in rhyme with each other, not with the preceding lines. The poet uses rhyme to connect the lines and create a cohesive thought. 

The rhymes in a sonnet are always the same (e.g. every rhyme is the same). The first couplet always starts with the first line, and the last couplet always ends with the last line.

The rhyming couplets of a sonnet usually include the following:

- the first two lines (the head rhymes)
- the last two lines (the tail rhymes)

What are the different types of shots in ice hockey,"Ice hockey is played on a rink that features a small raised goal with a net and opposing players who wear gloves and protective jerseys. The rules for the game are very strict and there is a small margin of error for each player.

The most common goal posts are generally known as ""slap shots"". These are shots that are aimed directly at the goal with one's stick, usually from the faceoff circle on the ice. The goalie, who is standing on their box, must make a save on the slap shot, stopping the puck with their body or face.

The most common shot consists of a player skating pass the puck to another player, who shoots the puck into the goal. This shot is called an ""Overtime"" shot, as it is aimed at the goal in the last 5 minutes of a game.","-Slapshot

How are odds different from probability?,"Probability is a measurement of how likely the event is or is not. In baseball, a batting average is an example of a probability.

In probability, you can calculate the probability of the MLB batting average being over .300 or under .250. The probability of an MLB batting average being over .300 is 0.3 * (0.3 - 0.2) = 0.7. The probability of an MLB batting average being under .250 is 0.3 * (0.1 - 0.2) = 0.7.

For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days.

How do you play basketball,"There are 4 basic categories to the game of basketball:
- Offense
- Defense
- Rebounding
- Stealing

The 4 categories are combined in a team sport to play as a team.

The game is played on a rectangular court with a 15 foot high net. The high net rules allow shooters to shoot the basketball over the net. Each team has 5 players on the court, 3 on offense and 2 on defense.

The offense is played on the left side of the court with the ball being passed from player to player. Each player is allowed to shoot the ball once, a defensive player can defend the basket by passing the ball to an open teammate. Once the ball is passed, the offensive player shoots the ball and the defensive player has to quickly pass it to a teammate to make a basket. Once the ball is made, the offensive player is awarded 2 points.

The defense is played on the right side of the court. The offense is passing the ball to the open teammates on the right. Once the ball is passed, the defensive player has to quickly pass it to a teammate who is open, to make a basket. Once the ball is made, the defensive player is awarded 1 point and the offensive player is awarded 2 points.

Rebounding is the ability to get the ball from the offensive player to an open teammate on the court. The offensive player can shoot the ball and the rebounder has to pass the ball to an open teammate on the other side. Once the ball is passed, the offensive player can shoot the ball and the rebounder has to immediately pass it to a teammate to make a basket. Once the ball is made the offensive player will receive 1 point and the rebounder will receive 2 points.

Stealing is the ability to get the ball from the offensive player to an open teammate who is not on the court. When the offensive player shoots the ball, the ball is stolen from the other team. Once the ball is stolen, the offensive player has to immediately pass it to a teammate who is not on the court to make a basket. Once the ball is stolen, the offensive player will receive 1 point and the other team will receive 2 points.","Basketball is a game played on a court with five players on each team. There are two baskets that are 10 feet tall on each end of the court and the goal of the game is to get the ball into the basket at the opposing end of the court. Each basket is worth two points, unless the ball is shot from outside of an arc that is painted on the floor. If the shot it made outside of the arc, then it's worth three points. The games are 48 minutes long with 4 even quarters at 12 minutes each. The clock also stops every time a basket is made, the ball goes out of bounds, or a foul is committed. When running with the ball, a player must continuously bounce it off the ground or else it's considered traveling which is a not allowed. Additionally, aggressive contact is also considered a foul. Basketball is more about finesse than it is about physicality.

Write a poem about George Washington.,"George Washington was an American Founding Father, military leader, and statesman. He led the Continental Army during the American Revolution and was a member of the United States Congress, serving one term from 1789 to 1797. He was also an outstanding soldier, officer, and diplomat, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Founding Fathers of the United States. He is considered the father of the American nation.

Washington was born in Tidewater Virginia, the grandson of a British Army officer and the great-grandson of a British General. Before the Revolutionary War, he studied law in Williamsburg. He was commissioned a lieutenant colonel and volunteered for Virginia's colonial militia, which was formed primarily for defense against Native American tribes. Starting in May 1775, Washington led a series of successful raids against the British Indian forces. His unit achieved the distinction of capturing a British officer's wife and two other women in the process.

In 1776, in response to Continental Congress President Thomas Jefferson's call for additional troops, Washington led a force of some 5,000 men. Washington's victories over the Native American tribes in the Shenandoah Valley and at Brandywine Creek in September 1777 made him a national hero, and he won election in 1780 as a delegate to the first Continental Congress. He was present at the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and as a member of the Second Continental Congress began drafting the Address to the Colonies, which was published in November 1776.

Washington led a force of 5,000 men in the Battle of Long Island on September 17, 1776. His troops defeated a British force of nearly 6,000 on Long Island, and further victories at Saratoga in November 1777 and Brandywine Creek in December 1777 established Washington as the Continental Army's commander. He was subsequently named a major general and placed in command of the Virginia militia, which was organized to resist the British and Indian forces.

In February 1778, the British launched a surprise attack on the American capital, Philadelphia, which Washington's troops repelled with great bravery. By the summer of 1778, Washington was recognized by the British as the head of the American forces, and he soon established a strong government in the new nation. By 1782, he was the most powerful political leader in the country.

As a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Washington became a principal architect of the United States Constitution. He also became a member of the State legislature,","George Washington was a British man

- In basketball, the game is basically a two on two match. Team A has the ball and Team B has the opponent, they each have 12 players on each team. Team A will try to put their best player on the opponent's court in order to get the ball and score more points.
- Game theory can be applied to basketball to predict the outcome of a game. For example, if Team A has a better scorer on the court, Team A will often send their better scorer to the opponents court in order to get the ball and score more points.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1).

Can you give me some background on Perez v. Campbell,"Perez v. Campbell, 448 U.S. 420 (100 SCt 2790, 65 LEd2d 849) (1980) was a United States Supreme Court case that had to do with the right to a speedy trial.

The statute of limitations for a crime that is a misdemeanor has not been extended to misdemeanors. The petitioner argued that this delay violated the right to a speedy trial. The Supreme Court disagreed and ruled that there is no right to a speedy trial for crimes that are misdemeanors and punishable by a fine or short term in jail.","Perez v. Campbell, 402 U.S. 637 (1971), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that Arizona's law suspending a driver's license was unconstitutional due to its conflict with the federal Bankruptcy Act under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.

How reliable is public transportation?,"Public transportation is an important part of life in many cities in the United States. Although the cost of public transportation is often higher than other forms of transportation, it is often faster and usually safer than driving a car. The quality of public transportation can vary widely, however, and it is usually safe to assume that public transportation is less reliable and safer than driving a car in the majority of cities. In addition, public transportation can be more financially appealing than driving a car. When planning a trip, it is important to note that public transportation in the United States is the most expensive and least reliable form of transportation for trips of less than three hours.","Reliability of public transportation varies drastically depending on which city you are in and depends on investment and maintenance of existing infrastructure. For example, the public transportation network in Switzerland spans a wide network that comprises of trains, trams, busses, and ferries, runs timely on a schedule to the minute, and is used as a primary mode of transportation for many residents. In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car.

What are some board games that involve strategy?,"Some board games can be very strategic, and involve a combination of card and dice based play.  Some of the games below will appeal to different types of players, as well as different ages and skill levels.

Scenario

Squad Leader

On the game board, each player has a squad of four soldiers.  Each soldier is numbered 1 through 4.  The objective is to capture the objective square on the board, which is numbered 1 through 7.  Each player begins by drawing two cards.  The first player to capture the objective can remove a soldier from play and add him to his squad, and the winner of that round is the player who captures the objective first.

Scenario is a card game that requires players to take turns placing cards face down on the game board.  Each turn, the players take turns adding new cards to their deck, adding soldiers to their squads, and moving soldiers around the game board.  Once a player has taken their turn, they can then play cards that affect their turn.

Action

An Action card is used to indicate the next player's turn.  The Action card is face down on the game board.  The player who drew that Action card will play that Action card and take their turn.  If the Action card is a Manipulation card, that player will use the Action to move soldiers around the game board.  If the Action card is a Command card, the player will play that Action card and call out the opponent's action.  The opponent will take their turn by following the same rules as the player who drew the Action card.

Scenario is a strategy game with a war theme, where the objective is to capture the objective, which are numbered 1 through 7.  The winner is the player who captures the objective first.","Catan, Diplomacy and Dune are some examples of board games that require strategy to win.",0.30825,0.997717,13.192148,0.802908,0.442367,3.148678,-5.242572784423828

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye,"Nuclear fission is the separation of a nucleus of an atomic mass from another nucleus of the same mass. The two resulting nuclei are identical to the original nucleus except for an extra neutron. This neutron is emitted along with the two neutrons emitted from the original nucleus. This results in the creation of two neutrons and an atomic mass, 2u+2n, which is less than the mass of either the original or the secondary nucleus.","Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.943854,0.994532,3.925165,0.797434,0.936479,1.519493,-3.8654258251190186

An optimisation problem can be categorised as continuous or discrete depending on the type of their variables. In a discrete optimisation problem, variables are discrete and countable. In contrast, continuous variables include infinitely uncountable values, for example, a variable over a non-empty range of real numbers. 

According to the number of objective functions, an optimisation problem is classified as single or multi-objective. A single-objective optimisation problem only involves one objective function to optimise. On the other hand, a multi-objective one considers two or more objectives simultaneously, which means the interaction between objectives has to be considered.",0.949464,0.994156,1.997015,0.120603,0.944727,1.001193,-3.3013415336608887

How do you make an iced matcha latter?,"I love drinking matcha. I've never been a big tea drinker. I've always just had a cup of hot tea. But when I first started drinking matcha, I was so hooked on it, I kept buying more and more. I ended up creating my own hot tea process, which I will detail in a future post. 

But I was always looking for an iced tea alternative, and I came across Matcha Latter, a matcha drip tea maker. I was skeptical, but my mom was a Matcha Latter convert, and I trusted her. I was also excited about the idea of making my own matcha. So I jumped in and I am so glad I did!

It took me a few tries to get it right, but I finally got it and I am so glad I did! It's easy to use, and it makes the perfect iced matcha. I also love that it doesn't require any straining. You just add water, and the tea goes through the drip mechanism and spits out the tea bag.

Here's what it looks like:

The best part is that it's affordable! I paid $14 for one. Not too bad, considering the price of matcha can range anywhere from $15 to $30. It's definitely worth it! I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves matcha and iced tea! You can also find more matcha drip tea makers on Amazon.

I hope you are inspired to try your first matcha! Let me know what you think of this post! If you have any questions, or suggestions to make this post better, feel free to leave them in the comments section below!

As always, thank you to Kate from The Gourmet Gatherer for hosting this giveaway!
