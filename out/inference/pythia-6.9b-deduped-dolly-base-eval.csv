Where is the best place to view the Northern Lights in Europe?,", Norway, Iceland and Svalbard yes, but it's a bit far from the cities.

A:

The best place to see the Northern Lights is in Arctic Norway. I have been there during the 20/21st of October, 2017.
I live in Denmark, so here I can only speak about Copenhagen. The city has a bus system, which allows you to go anywhere in the city center (not in the suburbs) for only a few euros.
The bus system has a bus route called ""Derailed"" (yes, it is a play on the word ""Dronningens gate""), which runs every 30 minutes from the city center to the North. The bus goes out to the open sea in the North and back to the city center.
This is the best way to get around the city.
It is not really expensive to take the bus, and it's a really nice way to see the city.
I don't have any travel agency experience, so I can't give you any recommendation. I am sure there are travel agencies in Copenhagen, that can help you with this matter.
I am looking forward to see the Northern Lights this winter, and I will go to Arctic Norway.

You are here

Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.

The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888; however, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky: from 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively. The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.

"What links Brazil, Uruguay, Mozambique and Angola"," the southern cone?

A:

I am not sure about this, but it might be because of the ""Southern Cone"" (aka ""Cone of Fire"" aka ""Fire-Bird""), an event that happened around 6000 BC.
The name ""Cone of Fire"" is connected to the fact that at the time, the whole southern hemisphere was a lot closer.
The idea was to have a new civilization in the southern hemisphere, so the first settlers would be more advanced, and the whole southern hemisphere would have a new culture.
You can read about it in this book.
Up to now the southern hemisphere has more civilizations (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, etc.) than the northern hemisphere (United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, etc.).
But the southern cone is the closest to the equator.
This is why the southern cone has the most advanced civilizations.

A:

As the other answers indicate, the answer is:

It's the Southern Cone

The southern hemisphere is the one with the most important and oldest cultures.

A:

Because at the time the southern hemisphere was the closest to the equator.
This is because the southern hemisphere was in a position to see most of the other hemisphere.
The northern hemisphere is the only one closer to the north pole.

It's true. If your pantry is full of nuts from the store, they're not going to be the best tasting. Your pantry will need to be cleaned out, and you should try and find some nuts that you can grow yourself.

Give me a list of pets that require low maintenance.,", neutered, etc.

I have a dog that has been in the same home for 20 years, and she is doing great! I have a dog that is very healthy and has no problems. I have a dog that is a little on the older side, and he is very healthy as well.

I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the owner of this thread... I also have a dog that has been with me for 20 years and he is in great shape. My dogs have stayed in great health throughout most of their lives.

I would be the first one to raise the alarm if something was wrong with one of my dogs, but I've never once heard anyone complain about their dog.

I think there are a lot of owners who have dogs who are unhealthy and that makes people think that all dogs are unhealthy.

My dog is an 8 pound lab mix. She is an absolute love and not nearly as lazy as some of the other posters claim. Her coat is shiny, it doesn't need to be clipped, and she is healthy. My dog has never had a serious illness. She is a great dog and she deserves to be treated that way.

I agree with the above posts about not judging an animal on how it looks. If a dog looks healthy, then it is healthy. My sister's dog is a large breed and I have seen her dogs in their final moments, and they all look just as healthy as the dog I have now.

I have a 7 year old dog and she is the healthiest dog I have ever had. She comes in from running and she has never had an accident and she is always very healthy.

I have a 6 month old lab/pit mix and he is just starting to get old. He is very energetic and has a very short attention span. He is the only dog that pees outside. He is also a very healthy dog.

My first dog was a 100 pound beagle. He was always sick and would vomit every time he ate. He was so sick that I nearly lost him. He did not live past 6 months. It was not a pretty sight.

I have a 6 year old dog who is a lab/lab mix. As other have said, you can't tell the difference between a healthy and unhealthy dog just by looking. I don't think my dog looks unhealthy. She is a very healthy dog.

The snow is falling slowly, and it's not thick enough to be a problem, but I do have one question. When I was in high school, we used to take the buses around town.

Planet Earth is a planet that has a unique set of properties, and so is our solar system. It's the only solar system that has a planet that can tolerate a very high temperature, that does not have all of its water frozen, and that has two planets that have atmospheres.
It's also the only solar system that has an ""Earth-like"" planet that's not Earth-like in the way that it's Earth-like. It's a planet that's a lot like Earth, in terms of its temperature and its gravity. It's also a lot like Earth in terms of its water content, and in terms of its atmosphere. It's a planet that's similar to Earth in almost every way that we can think of.

A:

Planet Earth is a planet that has a unique set of properties, and so is our solar system.

Not really, other planets in our Solar System do have unique sets of properties. In fact, that is one of the things that make them interesting.

It's the only solar system that has a planet that can tolerate a very high temperature, that does not have all of its water frozen, and that has two planets that have atmospheres.

Well, if you consider the Earth's atmosphere, you have a lot of oxygen, nitrogen and methane.

It's also the only solar system that has an ""Earth-like"" planet that's not Earth-like in the way that it's Earth-like. It's a planet that's a lot like Earth, in terms of its temperature and its gravity. It's also a lot like Earth in terms of its water content, and in terms of its atmosphere. It's a planet that's similar to Earth in almost every way that we can think of.

It is exactly like Earth in terms of water content. It's exactly like Earth in terms of gravity. It's exactly like Earth in terms of temperature. But it's not exactly like Earth in terms of atmosphere, because it has no ozone layer. In fact, it has no atmosphere.

So, if the Earth is a unique planet, how is it that it is ""almost"" like Earth?

I think the question is really about the word ""almost"", and its connotations. If you look at it in a vacuum, then it is a unique planet. But if you think about it in a real context, then it is not.

The world's second-largest marathon is on the edge of Thailand's bustling capital, Bangkok.

This year, an estimated 50,000 people will start the 26.2-mile (42-kilometre) route between the grand Royal Plaza and the historic Grand Palace.

Many will run in support of the Thai Red Cross Society, as well as the International Red Cross Society.

Some will run for charity, while others will simply enjoy the race's atmosphere.

The Red Cross Society said it would raise more than $760,000 for the disaster relief and rehabilitation efforts of the affected communities.

In addition to the $760,000, the Red Cross Society will also donate $1 million to the Thai Red Cross Society in the form of cash and goods.

""This is the first time that the Red Cross gets involved in this size of a marathon,"" a spokesman said.

""We received a letter from the International Red Cross Society last Friday, and after consulting with our board of directors, we decided that we could help the victims through the marathon.""

Thailand's prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, said that of the 50,000 runners, ""about a third are foreigners and the rest are Thai.""

He added that the organisers had not only made arrangements for the foreign runners, but also for the Thai runners.

""We have lots of volunteers, including some who will run for charity,"" he said.

The Red Cross Society will send a team of staff to cover the medical needs of the event, as well as the organising committee.

""The marathon will be divided into two sections, and the Red Cross Society will join the organising committee,"" said Mr Pornchai Krua, spokesman for the Red Cross Society.

He added that the organisers would pay for the costs of the Red Cross Society's team, and also for the medical staff.

""We are grateful for the assistance,"" he said.

Race director Chaiyapol Pongpaen said that this year's event would be",A marathon is 26.2 miles and 42.195 kilometers,0.205318,0.997955,4.697458,0.992899,0.204872,1.4197,-5.330984115600586

Q:

What is the difference between Timeout and continuationToken in a TRY CATCH

Is there any difference between Timeout and continuationToken in a TRY CATCH.
Can we use Timeout for both normal exception and FOR completed exception?

A:

Yes, there is a difference. The Timeout is used to quit the Try/Catch block when a timeout condition occurs. The continuationToken is the value that is returned by the Try/Catch block when it is exited.
If you want to catch exceptions that are not timeout exceptions, you should use the Timeout and not the continuationToken.
Example:
try
{
    // Code that can throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    if (ex is TimeoutException)

How do you subtract two numbers?,"

How do you subtract two numbers?

There are two ways to subtract two numbers. You can either subtract the smaller number from the larger one, or you can subtract the larger number from the smaller one.

To subtract the smaller number from the larger one, divide the larger number by the smaller number. Then subtract the result from 1. For example, to subtract 7 from 15, simply divide 15 by 7. Then subtract the result from 1. The result is 2.

To subtract the larger number from the smaller one, subtract the smaller number from the larger one. For example, to subtract 7 from 15, subtract 15 from 7. The result is 8.

**RANDOM","Subtraction is an operation that identifies the total count of objects in a collection of items after a specific count of items are removed from the starting total.

You can subtract two numbers by starting with an initial count, which represents the number to subtract from, and a second count which represents the number to subtract.  Then remove one from the starting count repeating this operation for the number of items in the subtract value.  

Subtraction is not associative, which means that the order in which subtraction is performed matters.  For instance, seven minus five (7 - 3) equals four (= 4) but four minus seven (4 - 7) equals minus three (= -3).",0.792164,0.997325,49.941701,0.995664,0.891635,10.723698,-9.76073169708252

I've been reading a bit about the MES-1 and the RE-1. I was wondering if any of you guys had any experience with either model. I'm interested in getting a good, reasonably priced preamp with decent power. I don't know how much bass I can expect from either of those two models, but I'm looking for a new preamp to keep my signal chain simple for a while. I've been using the Strymon Timeline for my bass rig, but I'm wondering if the MES-1 (or the RE-1) might be a good option for bass.

Thank you.

I've heard about the MES-1 and RE-1, but I haven't actually heard either of them. How do they compare to the Timeline? How many watt amps do they have? I'm looking for a high quality preamp that I can use with my main rig. I've been using a Lipstick 500, but I'm looking to upgrade.

I've also heard that the RE-1 has a similar high quality preamp, but that it's a little bit less powerful than the Lipstick 500.

I would say that the purpose of a piano is not only to play, but also to be an artistic creation. It should have its own personality. The story of the instrument is important as well.

Someone who is passionate about the piano should be able to pick up a new piano and be able to play it after a short while.

Pianos should not have to be tuned for the first time after being purchased.

Pianos should not have to be tuned for the first time after being purchased.

I find it interesting that you used the word ""first time,"" because that implies that pianos are supposed to be tuned every time they are played.

This isn't really a minor issue. The sound of a piano changes as it is played, and if it is not tuned properly, the tone will not be stable over time. Unless the piano is being played lightly, the tension on the strings should be increased to the point where the tuning pegs are at the proper tension.

This is a good thing to practice. Take a piano that has been played more often than usual and put a new tuning peg into the string. Then observe the tone. Is it stronger, or weaker? If the tone is stronger, or the note is sharper, it is probably due to the tension of the string being too high.

The sound of a piano changes as it is played, and if it is not tuned properly, the tone will not be stable over time.

That's because your piano has been out of tune and you haven't been able to keep it in tune. Sometimes a piano will not require tuning for several weeks or months.

Pianos should not have to be tuned for the first time after being purchased.

The short answer is that the piano is being played and it's not in tune. In this case, the piano should be tuned.

I find it interesting that you used the word ""first time,"" because that implies that pianos are supposed to be tuned every time they are played.

Who are the big six in EPL?,".com

There are a lot of teams outside of the top six in the EPL. How does one decide who the big six are?

There’s a lot of talk about the top six teams in the EPL, and it’s easy to see why. For one, it’s what everybody watches, and the big six are the ones everyone wants to beat, regardless of the quality of competition. It’s also a simple measure: the top six in the Premier League each year earn more than the other 19 teams combined.

But these six teams aren’t perfect. Chelsea, Manchester United, and Manchester City have all fallen victim to lowly seasons and drawn criticism for their lack of results. In contrast, the other four teams have all posted better records.

So, how do we decide who the big six are?

We took a look at points per game (ppg) in the EPL after the first six games of each season. We then averaged the top six teams together to get a new number, which we’ll call Point Per Game. We then compared the Point Per Game of each team with the league’s average ppg for that season. The teams with the best ppg are the big six, and we’ll use that number as a metric for who the big six are.

Below, we’ve used the same methodology to compare the Point Per Game of each team to the league’s average ppg in the EPL for the past five seasons. The table shows the top six teams in the league, and the average ppg for the teams in that group.

Were cars used for transportation in the 19th century in King Field?," and the cars are placed on a side-street which leads to the State House.

In the early days, the cars were used as taxis and were driven by men to the State House. The cars still exist and are preserved in the State House museum.

The cars have a large, comfortable interior and the driver sits in the front left seat. The driver's seat is higher than that of the passenger.

The interior of the car is built of wood. The front doors are similar to those of today's cars, but the rear doors are large, and are similar to those of today's buses.

In the early days, the cars were often outfitted with larger glass windows than are common today.

The State House Museum also has a small collection of early domesticated animals. These include chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, dogs and cats.

In this photograph, a horse is being led by a driver along the road. The horse is not being used for transportation, but for pulling a cart.

In the early days, the horses were not only used for pulling carts, but for leaping fences and for pulling wagons.

The horses were used for transportation and recreation, but were also kept for work as farm and field animals.

The horses were not used for transportation until the end of the 19th century. In 1914, the first horse-drawn car was purchased for public transportation in King Field.

The photo below shows a horse being hitched to a carriage. In the early days, horses were hitched to carriages or wagons, but were seldom hitched to carts.

Name the Chinese satellite launched for Mars which failed?,"iousness.

A:

I would say that's a very good and an interesting question.
The first one is from the Encyclopedia Britannica:

In the English language, we lack the word ""parallax"" to describe the apparent displacement of one celestial body relative to another. The word ""parallax"" comes from the Greek παραλλαξ, which means ""returning,"" from παραλλαγή, which means ""change"". So parallax is the change in the angle of a celestial body as seen from Earth due to the relative motion of Earth and the observed body. However, because the Earth is rotating, the apparent angle of a celestial body seen from Earth is not the true angle.

To answer your question, the name of the Chinese satellite is called the Chang'e 3.
The second one is from the Wikipedia:

Pluto is the only member of the Kuiper Belt to have had its orbit confirmed, and it has been the only object in the solar system to have had its orbit confirmed by multiple methods. Its orbit is sufficiently well-determined that Pluto could be used as the basis for a hypothetical follow-up mission to the outer planets, a similar mission to the Voyager program.

To answer your question, it is a mission named after Pluto.

What is a spatial network?," it is a network of interactions among individuals that occur at the same place and time. This is a complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous network that interacts with the environment and develops according to environmental and social circumstances. The network derives from socialization, as well as from the emergence of social ties, and is influenced by the physical conditions of the place, including the dwelling characteristics, the infrastructures, and the availability of natural resources.

A spatial network is a network of interactions among individuals that occur at the same place and time.

Spatial networks can be analyzed using network theory. The basic elements of a network are individuals or places. Some of these individuals or places are connected to each other by means of relationships: they are related either by a physical proximity (through proximity networks) or by some kind of interaction (through interaction networks). The quantity of relationships between individuals or places is called the degree of the element. In a social network, the degree of each node is proportional to the number of relationships established by it. In a spatial network, the degree of each node is proportional to the number of relations that node can establish with other nodes.

In a social network, the degree of each node is proportional to the number of relationships established by it. In a spatial network, the degree of each node is proportional to the number of relations that node can establish with other nodes.

We analyzed the spatial network of the main cities in Mexico that, according to the 2013 IPC census, have more than a million inhabitants. The degree of each node is proportional to the number of relations that node can establish with other nodes. Thus, we can distinguish a core, which is the set of nodes that have the highest number of relations with the other nodes. The leafs (or leaves) are the set of nodes that have the highest number of connections with the nodes in the core. The leaves are the most densely connected places in the network and they are the most central. We can also distinguish an intermediate region (the core of the network). Nodes that belong to the core of the network are the most central places of the network.","A spatial network (sometimes also geometric graph) is a graph in which the vertices or edges are spatial elements associated with geometric objects, i.e., the nodes are located in a space equipped with a certain metric. The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.",0.627286,0.994275,21.73698,0.994774,0.642634,4.99919,-3.800337791442871

"Given this paragraph about e-readers, what is the e-reader designed and marketed by Amazon?"," (in Chinese, it translates as “paperbook”).

Amazon’s Kindle, the first e-book reader, was released in 2007. The Kindle is the best-selling e-book reader, with over 1.5 million sold as of June 2009. The Kindle is an electronic book reader that can display text, images, and other content on a 7-inch color display.

The Kindle is compatible with over 200 e-book formats and can display e-books in landscape or portrait mode. It has been criticized for having a high price and a low reading speed.

The Kindle Store offers the largest selection of e-books and newspapers in the world. The Kindle Store includes over 1 million titles, most of which are free. Amazon does not charge a fee for accessing the Kindle Store.

Amazon has also been criticized for its usage of Chinese labor. Many reports have pointed out that much of the manufacturing for the Kindle is outsourced to China.

Amazon also has been criticized that it uses the United States Postal Service (USPS) to ship its products. For example, the USPS is the principal carrier of the Kindle and many other Amazon products. Amazon has been able to lower shipping costs by using the USPS.

Amazon also has a program in which the US Postal Service offers free shipping for Amazon products to US customers. For example, the USPS will ship a Kindle to a customer for $0.00 US. Amazon is also using the USPS for shipping Kindle products in the UK.

Amazon has become the largest Internet retailer in the world. Many people have criticized Amazon for not paying taxes to the United States, and for using below-cost shipping for its products.

Did You Know?

The word magnet is derived from the Greek word ""magnes"" which means ""iron"". Magnets are created when a type of iron called ferromagnetism is present. The iron atoms are aligned and attract one another.

What are Magnets Used For?

One of the most important applications of magnets is in the manufacture of electrical devices. Magnets are used to make the electrical connections in motors, transformers, and generators. Magnets are also used in television sets and radios. Magnets are also found in a variety of household items such as paper clips, compasses, and the lid of a medicine bottle.

A magnet is an object, composed of two plates of different metals, which are polar in nature. This means that they are attracted to one another when placed in the same direction. When placed in opposite directions, they repel. For example, iron and steel are polar.

A magnet is attracted to iron because iron has a magnetic field. A magnet is repelled from iron because iron has a non-magnetic field. Iron has a magnetic field because most of the iron atoms are aligned in the same direction.

What is the History of Magnets?

The discovery of the magnetic field began with the Greek scientist, Thales, who is believed to have been the first person to use magnets in a practical way. He used magnets to hold together the pieces of a sundial.

Magnetism was also known to the ancient Chinese. It is believed that the Chinese used magnets in the first wheel of a cart to assist in guiding the cart.

The Greeks and the Chinese also wrote about magnetism. However, the first book that was published on the subject of magnetism was by the English scientist, Michael Faraday, in 1831.

In 1857, the French scientist, Antoine-Emile Becquerel discovered that when he allowed a piece of uranium to heat up, a small amount of radiation was emitted. His discovery led him to believe that the uranium had the ability to produce electricity.

In 1949, the American scientist, Henry Perkin, discovered that if he heated a mixture of aniline and potassium iodide, he could produce a bright blue coloured compound. He realized that this compound was a new type of pigment made up of two elements that he had never encountered before.

The discovery of the first permanent magnet took place in 1820 when the German scientist,","Items that are strongly or weakly attracted are called ""ferromagnetic"" and ""paramagnetic"", respectively. These include: iron nail, paper clips, a tin can, a compass.
Items that are repelled by a magnet are either ""paramagnetic"" or themselves permanent magnets of the opposite polarity, including: a magnet of opposite polarity, pyrolytic carbon sheet. Items that are not affected by a permanent magnet are called ""nonmagnetic"" and include: a plastic cup, a glass window, a leather wallet, a brick.",0.041366,0.167252,21.993145,0.616988,0.029888,4.569728,-5.2117695808410645
5 fruits more healthy than apples," control with no added sugar sweetens the outcome, and apples are also a good source of fibre, which is helpful for digestion.

Dairy-free: almond milk

I’ve found that almond milk can be used as a dairy-free alternative in a number of recipes. You can make it with water or use the recipe below.

1 cup almonds

1/2 cup water

1/4 cup coconut sugar

1/4 cup sunflower seeds

1 tbsp almond butter

1 tsp vanilla extract

Soak the almonds in the water overnight, or for at least 6 hours, or for about 8 hours if you can.

Drain the almonds and grind them in a blender or food processor until they’re very finely ground. Add the sugar, seeds, and almond butter and blend to make a thick paste.

Transfer the paste to a bowl and mix in the vanilla.

I use this almond milk with apples in a number of recipes. It can also be used with bananas or peaches. Here’s a recipe for banana ice cream with almond milk, or you can add almond milk to other ice creams.

Fruit smoothie with almond milk

1 banana

1/2 cup almond milk

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

1/4 tsp ground nutmeg

2 heaped tbsp rolled oats

1/2 cup chopped frozen berries

2 tbsp cacao nibs or cacao powder

1/2 tsp stevia, to sweeten

Dash of sea salt

1/4 tsp cinnamon

You can add other fruit to the smoothie: I like to use frozen peaches and raspberries, and I add a couple of handfuls of spinach. Just add to the smoothie when you blend it.

Coconut milk

If you don’t like the taste of almond milk, you can try coconut milk. I like to use this in place of almond milk in recipes that call for almond milk, and you can also use it in a number of ice creams and puddings.

Coconut milk is made from the water and flesh of a coconut, so it’s a very healthy drink, and it has a wonderful, creamy texture and flavour.

Tell me a few highlights about Madonna's impact on pop music.,".

Madonna: It was a completely different time, and it was a time that I treasured, and when I first started, I was very much influenced by the art world, and I was very much influenced by other artists in the art world. I was very much a part of that whole, and I got to know many artists like Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. I was also very much influenced by the New York City art scene and the music scene in New York City, and I was very much influenced by the artists and musicians that were there. So that was a lot of the sense of who I was. I didn't have a choice on the music side of things, I had to do what I couldn't do in the art world. I didn't have a choice of what I wanted to do. I knew what I wanted to do, but it was very difficult for me to do in the art world, whereas in music I could just do what I wanted to do. I was very lucky to have that freedom.

What kind of an impact did Madonna have on the music scene when she first hit the scene in 1984?

Madonna: She was a great influence on the music scene, because she was so fresh, and so new, and so different. And she had this whole concept of music and what it meant to her, and her son had died and that was a very personal thing. I think it was an extremely difficult time for her, so I think she was in a lot of pain, I think she felt like she had to find something that would help her make it through that period of time. So I think she started her career with that kind of attitude, and she put a lot of herself into her music. She was a very strong woman, and she felt like she didn't have any options, and she was a woman in a man's world. So she used that to inspire herself and used that as a strength.

You've talked about the early days of listening to other artists like Prince and Yes. Were you involved in the music scene at all at that point?

Madonna: Yes, I was very much involved in the music scene when I first started. I was very much involved in the music scene when I first started. I was in the East Village, and I was part of the East Village scene. I was watching the music scene live, and I was a part of it, but it wasn't until later on","Madonna is known worldwide as the top-selling female pop artist of all time.

You could also do a paragraph explaining why an inverted yield curve was not a problem, and then a paragraph explaining why it would be a problem. The inverted yield curve is not a problem because the Fed’s securities are safe. The Fed is able to buy securities that are risk-free and also has the ability to print money to purchase those securities. Also, the Fed can buy securities outside of the United States to help keep interest rates low to help boost the economy.

Once you have all of the paragraphs on why an inverted yield curve could be a problem, you could write a paragraph explaining why an inverted yield curve is not a problem.

“The inverted yield curve is not a problem because the Fed’s securities are safe.

Lygodactylus gutturalis:

How does the Yangtze River Dolphin get its name? The answer may be that Yangtze River dolphins are named after the Yangtze River. Yangtze River dolphins are indeed different from dolphins in general. The Yangtze River dolphin has a slender body, distinctive white belly, and distinctive black spots on its back. These unique features make it easy for people to identify Yangtze River dolphins, which are found in the Yangtze River estuary, and that is why it is called the Yangtze River dolphin.

I am looking for a coffee method that is better then regular coffee in my opinion, I am trying the pour over method, but I would like to know if there are any benefits to this over regular coffee?

Re: what are the benefits of pour over coffee?

From what I understand, the pour over method is a method of preparation that is done in front of the user, rather then the user brewing their coffee at a standard coffee pot or coffee maker. Therefore, the taste is accentuated and the coffee has a lot more texture to it.

I was told that the pour over method produces a very smooth cup of coffee. I have yet to see any research or articles on this. I understand that it is supposed to give the coffee a more pleasurable taste and texture.

I currently use the pour over method and I enjoy it. I also buy and grind my own beans.

Re: what are the benefits of pour over coffee?

I have a pour over coffee maker and love it. It is the most delicious coffee I have ever had. I have never had a coffee before that tasted so good and rich. I love it. I am a coffee drinker and have had many coffees but this is the best coffee I ever had. It is like drinking a hot chocolate on a cold day. I think it is a wonderful way to drink coffee.

I use a Hario V60, which is a $60 French press. It is a very simple and easy to use method of preparation. There are a lot of benefits to this method.

You can get a very flavorful cup of coffee. I use a 1:1 ratio of beans to water. I don't grind the beans, so I use the grind setting on the scale. A more traditional method would use fresh ground beans. This gives a much more flavorful cup of coffee.

Is pan-genomics a synonym for human pan-genome?

No, pan-genome is a term that describes the entire set of genes that are shared by a group of organisms. Pan-genome also refers to the size of the pan-genome, which is the total number of genes in the pan-genome. Pan-genome refers to the size of the pan-genome of all the organisms in a group, not to the number of organisms in the group.

What is pan-genomics?

The term pan-genome refers to the collection of genes that are carried across multiple strains of the same species. The pan-genome is the entire gene repertoire of the species, and there are no genes that are unique to a single strain of the species. The pan-genome is the size of the pan-genome, which is the total number of genes in the pan-genome. The pan-genome can also be referred to as the core genome, since it includes the genes found in all strains. The pan-genome also refers to the size of the pan-genome, which is the total number of genes in the pan-genome.

Very nicely said, I am a ukulele player and I agree with you. Besides the tuning, a ukulele is easier to play than a guitar. I have a pedal steel guitar and the uke is in the same range, so I can play the same songs on them. The fretting hand is more relaxed, the time to get used to the fretting hand is short. The ukulele is very easy to play and the songs are easy to learn. It's good for beginners.

A guitar has 6 strings and a ukulele has 4 strings. Because of this, the sound range of a ukulele is narrower than a guitar.

Looking from the front of a guitar, the thickness of the strings increases gradually from right to left. For a ukulele, the two outmost strings are the thinnest and the second left string is the thickest.

The Last of Us is a brutal, brutal game. I have never, not even once, in my 40 hours with the game, had to turn in my controller. The Last of Us is a game that features the death of a woman (Ellie) and her subsequent recovery, and the destruction of her family. This is a game that contains the death of a child. This is a game that features the death of a black man in the context of a game that is supposed to be set in a post-apocalyptic United States. This is a game where the player is never allowed to forget the death of a man, played by a white man, who is in the game, because he is the only “black” person on screen. The game is filled with racism and sexism and violence. It features the rape of a woman. It features the murder of a child. It features the rape and murder of a black child.

The Last of Us is a game that feels like it is trying to tell us something, and it is trying to tell us something that is best avoided. It is a game that I avoid playing. It is a game that I avoid helping me make sense of, because it is a game that makes me feel like a terrible person, and that my approval of its message is justified. I have played a lot of games that I have liked, and I have played a lot of games that I have not liked. I have played a lot of games that I have not liked playing, and I have played a lot of games that I have not liked but felt a need to play through, because I am a flawed person, and I have been told that the message of those games is what I need to hear.

It contains many of the same elements that I love: a compelling story, an original setting, and (most importantly) a compelling, original voice.

Hello. This is my first visit to your blog! We are a team of volunteers and starting a new initiative in a community in the same niche. Your blog provided us valuable information to work on. You have done a marvellous job!

I and also my friends ended up checking out the good helpful hints on your web blog and so at once I got a horrible feeling I had not thanked you for those tips. These people had been certainly very interested to see them and have in effect surely been taking advantage of those things. Appreciation for being simply kind and for figuring out this kind of important things millions of individuals are really desperate to understand about. My very own honest regret for not expressing gratitude to you sooner.

Write more, thats all I have to say. Literally, it seems as though you relied on the video to make your point. You clearly know what youre talking about, why waste your intelligence on just posting videos to your weblog when you could be giving us something enlightening to read?

Hello, Neat post. There is a problem with your site in internet explorer, could check this¡K IE nonetheless is the market leader and a good component to people will pass over your excellent writing due to this problem.

I have been surfing online more than 3 hours today, yet I never found any interesting article like yours. It is pretty worth enough for me. In my opinion, if all web owners and bloggers made good content as you did, the web will be a lot more useful than ever before.| I couldn't resist commenting. I 've spent 1 hour searching for such informatіon. I'll also share it with a couple of friends interested in it. I have just bookmarked this website. Right now with the job done, I going to enjoy some model material. Gracias!! Greetings from Florida!

Hey there would you mind letting me know which webhost you're utilizing? I've loaded your blog in 3 different browsers and I must say this blog loads a lot quicker then most. Can you recommend a good hosting provider at a fair price?Kudos, I appreciate it!

I am extremely impressed with your writing skills and also with the layout on your weblog. Is this a paid theme or did you customize it yourself? Either way keep up the nice quality writing, it's rare to see a great blog like this one today.

I would just tell my mom straight up that I'm going to take my money and go spend it on myself. Nothing else matters. I'm not going to live my life to provide for my family. I'm not going to get a job I hate, I'm not going to get a job I love, I'm not going to get a job I have no passion for, I'm not going to keep trying to find a job I hate, I'm not going to live my life like a slave for my family. I'm going to live my life the way I want.

I'd probably get some furniture for my room (and probably a new computer for my room, too) and then I'd probably go to Venice Beach and hang out.

The rest of the days, I'd spend doing things I love and being with my friends.

I would buy a bike and ride it all over the city. I would spend a lot of time at the pier and at the beach. I would get a really cool tattoo, and I would have a lot of fun, and I would probably get a dog. I would travel a lot, probably to Europe and Africa. I would spend a lot of time with my family, my friends, and my boyfriend. I would probably go to school, but I would take a lot of time off to travel the world.

I would of course buy a new car, and a new apartment, and probably get a lot of expensive clothes. I would spend a lot of time with my family and friends. I would also buy a lot of school and art supplies for my younger brother who is still in high school. I would buy a lot of books for my younger brother and I. I would probably really enjoy going out to eat with my family and friends and enjoy eating good food. I would also probably spend a lot of time with my friends.

I would get a new car, buy a new apartment, and live in it all by myself. I would spend a lot of time with my friends and get a dog. I would travel alot and actually live abroad. I would get an art degree. I would also buy a lot of books for my younger brother.

Then I'd put aside 1 million for my retirement savings, putting it in a longterm investment account. With the remaining million, I'd use another 500k for short term savings, and put that in a more aggressive investment.

Who is the greater footballer of all time?,"pajor

What is the best goal you've ever seen?

I saw this guy playing for Spurs in the Premier league a few years back and he scored a goal that was, for me, the best goal of all time. I couldn't quite believe it when he did it, it was so unbelievably cool.

What has been the most memorable moment of your life?

The moment I won the 2006/07 Premier League title with West Ham. It was the most memorable moment of my life as I wasn't even born when I first played for West Ham. It was such a proud moment and to see my club lifting the Premier League title for the first time in 43 years was amazing.I know people have called me a Luddite and all that stuff but I've just always done things myself and I've never really been one for modern technology.

I didn't have any access to Twitter or Facebook so I never really experienced the rise of social networking sites. And I think it's just a good thing that I never had the chance to experience it as there's no doubt that they would have been a distraction.

I've always been a big believer that you have to work hard and sometimes that means missing out on some things.

But I do think that technology is a great tool and it can be used in a way that is helpful.

What is the best thing that has happened to you since you started using Twitter?

My Twitter account has been a great way to stay in contact with the people who I have a lot of mutual friends with.

I've been able to stay in touch with my friends and family when I've been away and I've been able to talk to people about things that I wouldn't normally say.

Obviously the content that people post on Twitter isn't always that great but I've been able to read things from people who I've never met before.

The most interesting thing to me is that Twitter is one of the only great ways that you can stay in touch with people who have completely different life experiences to you.

What has been the most challenging thing about using Twitter?

I think the most challenging thing about Twitter is just getting started with it.

I've found it to be a bit of a minefield of a thing to start with, with so many different accounts and so many different ways of using Twitter.

But I've learned a lot over the last few","There is no universal consensus on who the greatest footballer of all time is.

Which is better - skiing or snowboarding","I prefer skiing over snowboarding. For three reasons: safety, reliability, and expediency

Safety - snowboarding can be a very dangerous sport. I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. 

Reliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. 

Expediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately.",0.159039,0.738698,45.900947,0.949791,0.128219,9.575339,-12.515341758728027

"What is a ""frunk"" in an electric vehicle?"," is a frunk, it's where the trunk of a car opens

A:

The term is used when referring to vehicles that have a limited amount of storage space.  Electric vehicles are not the only ones that have frunks.

A:

The term is one of many ""one-word"" names for a feature that is common in the design of automobiles, but is not specific to electric cars. 
Frunk is defined as:

A small trunk or compartment for storing smaller items such as suitcases, golf bags, or bicycles.

In most models of automobiles, there is a compartment above the rear axle line that is referred to as a trunk.  It is not a huge compartment, but it is more than adequate for storing items such as the spare tire.
In the design of electric cars, the battery box is located deep within the car and usually empty.  So, the term frunk was coined to refer to the compartment above the rear axle line.  The name is not meant to imply that the compartment is a trunk, but is just a generic name for a compartment.  
The term is commonly used on the internet and when referring to the rear compartment of a car.  I believe the term frunk was created before the phrase electric car was coined.

A:

It's a local term in Vancouver, BC.

What is the best way to recover from a shoulder SLAP tear?," is no different than a rotator cuff tear. But, a SLAP tear causes additional damage to the biceps tendon and the rotator cuff tendons. Therefore, it's important to consider the entire shoulder complex when treating an SLAP tear.

The best way to treat a SLAP tear is to first perform a physical therapy program that addresses the patient's underlying cause of the tear. If the shoulder trauma was severe enough that it caused the patient to experience a shoulder dislocation, a SLAP repair should be performed. If the shoulder trauma was mild enough that the patient did not have a shoulder dislocation, a SLAP repair can be performed after a physical therapy program has been completed.

What is the best way to determine if a SLAP tear is an emergency?

The best way to determine if a SLAP tear is an emergency is to determine if the patient is having a sudden onset of shoulder pain. If this is the case, the patient should be taken to an emergency room immediately. Following this, the patient should be referred to a shoulder surgeon for evaluation and a diagnosis.

How is the SLAP tear diagnosed?

The SLAP tear can be diagnosed by observing the patient's shoulder motion. This is done by creating a false position of the shoulder. The patient is asked to perform a certain amount of flexion, abduction and external rotation. If there is pain or tenderness, the patient's shoulder will not be able to be moved in the desired manner. This is the first clue that the patient may have a tear in the shoulder.

How is a SLAP tear diagnosed?

The shoulder is examined by visual observation, with the patient supine on the examining table. The arm should be in the neutral position. The examiner will then depress the patient's shoulder with one hand, and the arm should be moved in the direction of the involved shoulder. This should be done slowly, and any pain or tenderness should be noted. The examiner will then move the shoulder in the opposite direction, and again note any pain or tenderness. The shoulder should be moved in the center of the range of motion. Any pain or tenderness should be noted. Any restrictions in motion should be noted, and the range of motion should be recorded.

What is the best way to obtain an accurate diagnosis of a SLAP tear?

The best way to obtain an accurate diagnosis is to perform a physical examination, which includes the shoulder's range of motion, and the patient's ability to move the shoulder","Non surgical interventions include physical therapy to strengthen the surrounding muscles and increase range of motion as well as steroid and PRP shots. It is recommended to try non surgical interventions first, and if the problem persists then meet with a surgeon to discuss alternatives.",0.28658,0.99452,26.036157,0.947349,0.462357,5.745393,-3.9330549240112305

Vary your workout routine. There are many different forms of exercise, and no one routine is right for everyone. If you are a beginner, you may not be able to complete a full workout routine. If you have a sedentary lifestyle, you may not require a workout routine at all.

If you are not sure how much you need to exercise to lose weight, you can start by doing very light exercise. Then, as you get stronger, you can add more exercise to your routine.

Pace yourself. If you try to do too many exercises at once, it will not work well. Instead, take a break every once in a while. You can also do more than one exercise, but do not do them back to back.

For example, yoga is great for increasing blood flow, reducing stress levels in the body, and improving flexibility. If you're interested in these benefits, as well as losing weight, I recommend exploring ""Hot Yoga"" as a more intense variation. Another method of getting into shape is through strength training. This type of workout is focused on lifting weights to put stress on your muscles. This stress leads to micro-tears in your muscles, which heal to become even stronger than before! Some great strength training workouts include; Squats, bench press, and bicep curls. If you are looking to begin a workout regiment that you can do rather independently, running is a great option.

What is Lean manufacturing,"?

Lean manufacturing is a manufacturing process, which is a set of processes that help a business to work more efficiently while also creating a higher quality product.

Lean manufacturing is an attempt to improve the quality of manufacturing processes by eliminating waste and unnecessary steps.

In the manufacturing industry, it is widely known that waste is the biggest cause of workplace accidents and also a major reason for the loss of productivity.

The aim of Lean manufacturing is to eliminate waste and also create a continuous flow of good quality products.

In Lean manufacturing, the key focus is to eliminate waste at each stage of the process by adopting a set of measures to do so.

In this process, raw materials go through a sequence of processes, which are planned to remove any unnecessary steps.

These steps are further divided into two types, which are the waste elimination and waste minimization.

The Start-up of Lean manufacturing

The start of the Lean manufacturing process was initiated by Toyota. The company started implementing the process in the mid-1980s. The process was then adopted by the other companies, and formed into a standard.

While meticulously looking over house balls with fingertip grips to feel like the pros, Jeff found one that caught his eye. The beautiful blue ball, with pink swirls and matching holes, already somehow had his same initials carved in.

As the two began to bowl, Jeff started with a strike. ""Oh, I like this one,"" he thought. Another strike! ""I could get used to this,"" he told himself.

Kyle was also bowling well, notching a strike and a 9-spare but nothing like what Jeff was doing on the lanes this fateful afternoon.

As Jeff lined up for his 3rd roll, his palms started sweating. The dreaded Turkey is where he got stuck so many times. But not today... ANOTHER STRIKE! Jeff jumped for joy. 

The two would go on to bowl their best games ever, a perfect 300 for Jeff and 279 for Kyle",0.160176,0.995958,17.855606,0.977831,0.197449,4.037404,-2.477266788482666

How was the Iraqi embassy in Beirut destroyed?,": Iraq was trying to get weapons of mass destruction - it was not defending against an attack, it was defending itself against a siege. The U.S. State Department openly told the terrorists that if they attacked the Iraqi embassy, they would be supported.

Extract the ingredients in bee pollen from the text.," the bee pollen from the text.

EtymologyIn 1798, a Group of bees at Cambridge University, under the leadership of John Stevens Henslow, with the help of naturalist William Ayrton, discovered the pollen-collecting habits of bumblebees. The word bumblebee derived from the first letters of their names, though ""bumble"", the common term for bumblebees, came later, probably after the species of bumblebee was named.

Origin and distributionBumblebees are common in the British Isles and on many of the surrounding islands, including the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Wight, the Isle of Arran, the Lizard Peninsula, the Orkney Islands, Shetland, and the Hebrides. The species, however, is absent from the Hebrides and the Outer Hebrides.

DescriptionBumblebees are relatively small insects, with a body length of approximately 2 cm (0.8 in.), a width of approximately 0.8 cm (0.33 in.), and a wingspan of approximately 0.5 cm (0.2 in.). The body is covered in hair, and the antennae are quite short. Bumblebees have three pairs of legs. Their forewings are slender and compressed, and their hindwings are very long and narrow. Bumblebees are generally yellow or black, and their coloration is often varied, with some species being reddish, or greenish, or blue.

Bumblebees have a stinger, which is located in the abdomen at the end of the hindlegs. The stinger contains a poison called venom. Bumblebees are capable of delivering this venom to their prey by forming a tube, called a bumblebee sting, into which the venom is injected. Bumblebees do not sting people, but they do sting other insects, or their own larvae. The sting of a bumblebee is usually painful, but it is rarely fatal, and bumblebee stings are also usually not life-threatening in small children or the elderly.

Ecology and behaviorBumblebees are found in a wide variety of habitats, including urban environments, woodlands, scrub, gardens, and fields. They are often observed visiting flowers, and in particular visiting the flowers of the daisy family, such as dandelions. Bumblebees are therefore often considered a","Bee pollen consists of simple sugars, protein, minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and some other components.",0.450208,0.971973,18.236616,0.860772,0.470231,4.19796,-4.377027988433838

They also develop new skills based on the content of the books.

Describe the quantitative easing in 3 bullet points or less.,"Describe the quantitative easing in 3 bullet points or less.Reverse-engineering of a consumer product can be an interesting task. When I was a kid, I had an orange-shaped, plastic-covered, plastic-framed, plastic-buttoned, plastic-flapped, plastic-snapped, plastic-screwed, plastic-lanced, plastic-rubbed, and plastic-screwed-in portable transistor radio. The plastic buttons for volume control were easy to replace and had the advantage of being short and easily accessible. A few years ago I visited a friend at his University campus. He had a radio that looked very similar to mine. I asked him how it worked and he told me that it was manufactured by a company called Philips. I asked him how he got it and he told me that he purchased it from a department store. I could not imagine why he would purchase it from a department store. I had no idea what a department store was and I assumed that it was a place where I would go to buy many different things that I could not afford to buy. A few years later, I learned that a department store is a store that sells clothing and other items as well as toiletries. I used to go to a department store once every two weeks and often bought all the toiletries that I needed. I had to think about it for a while to figure out why I had purchased my radio from a department store.

In the 1970s, I had a friend who worked in a factory that made plastic buttons for radios. My friend was mad at me because I was not going to buy one of his radios. I told him that I would buy it anyway because he earned it. I found a factory that manufactured the plastic buttons for radios and bought some from them. My friend was upset. He said that I was not going to buy one because he was selling it. I told him that I would buy it from him. He said that I would not get it for a while because he had to sell some to pay for the other buttons. I told him that I would buy all of it. He said that I would not get it all. I was angry. I bought all of the metal buttons from him and the plastic buttons from a different factory. I told my friend that I was not going to buy any more buttons but he said that there was a factory making the buttons that I wanted and they would make it for me. I told him that I did not want to","1- Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy action in which the government buys bonds and other assets to keep long term interest rate low to stimulate the economy.

What should I consider before taking a job with a lot of travel?,", and work/life balance?

A:

Take it in context.
Is it a one time deal (ie. a contract assignment)? Or is it an ongoing consulting project that you expect to be doing for the next few years?
If it's just a one time deal, then you may find that you would be much happier working for a company within your own country (or a few hundred miles away). So you might not mind the travel, and it may be a good opportunity for you.
If however, you expect to be working with a company for a while, then maybe you should look at some of the other questions here that talk about the long term prospects for a career.
I find that there are some great opportunities for people who are willing to travel. I think that once you've worked in a few places and know what you can do, then you can make a great case for yourself.
Once you've been in a few places, then you can start with the company you want to work for and try to make a case for yourself, in your own way. The more your case can stand on its own, the more likely it is to be accepted.

A:

I am a firm believer in working abroad. I have worked for 3 companies in the past few years and am currently employed at a company that is based in a country that I have never visited.
The main reason I have found for this is to gain experience, to have more work and to get away from the routine and expectations of a home country.
If you are under the age of 30, I would recommend visiting the country you are going to if you can. If you are older, then it is more difficult to gain experience but it is possible. 
A few things to consider:

How much you want to travel.
How much you want to spend on living expenses.
How much you want to invest in a new car.
How much you are willing to learn a new language.

If you have a choice, I would recommend putting together a budget and a list of things you want to do. Then do both of these things before you leave.
My first short trip was to Thailand. I traveled for 5 days and spent $50-75 USD/day (including travel and food). I used my saved up money and bought a car. I would recommend this as a way to get away from the routine.

Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?

"Given this paragraph about Thanjavur paintings and its origins, what are the typical features of Thanjavur paintings?","

Answer

I'm not going to get into details, but many people dismiss the importance of preparing their home for the winter, they just leave it empty, they don't do anything. I don't think that's a good idea. It's just as simple to make a few simple changes to your home and have a nice warm home as it is to just walk away from your home.

Not true at all. I think it is a good idea to go through and remove the unnecessary. Things which are not used and just collecting dust takes up space.

I have to say that I have been on the fence about this topic for some time. I think that people should prepare their homes for winter. I don't think that I have ever experienced a winter where it was warm enough to go outside. So, when I say don't prepare, I mean don't prepare your home.

How did the state legislatures change the number of lanes on them?

add the following paragraph:

In the Great Recession, the U.S. economy went into freefall, and states began to cut funding for road maintenance and construction. This resulted in even greater congestion, as new interstates were designed to include only a single lane in each direction, followed by a minimum of 3 lanes in the future.

This paragraph should be inserted between the two above paragraphs.

Consider revising this paragraph to emphasize that underfunded transportation systems contributed to the creation of the five interstates, as follows, and add the following paragraph:

Commuters and travelers in the United States rely on roads for their daily commutes and for quick trips to work, school, or the store. They travel on highways and roads to save time and money. The interstate system was conceived in the 1950s as a way to provide better interstate traffic flow and a faster trip for commuters.[6] The first Interstate highway was completed in 1956, connecting New York City to Cleveland, Ohio. The original system had ten interstates: I-90, I-95, I-70, I-90, I-95, I-75, I-76, I-84, I-70, and I-95.[7]

What is the oldest type of flight technology?," is an important part of the history of flight. The first aircraft was designed and built by the Wright brothers. They used a fixed wing design. The wings are fixed so that the airflow over the wing is stable. The success of the Wright brothers' flight was due to the use of their powered glider, not to the fixed wing design. The first powered aircraft was the Montgolfier balloon. The Montgolfier brothers used their balloon to help them reach the first public flight. The last type of aircraft was the dirigible, which is used as a means of transportation. It is a large hot air balloon without a motor. A dirigible is used in the movie ""Men in Black"" and in the movie ""Cast Away"". The first aircraft was designed by Leonardo da Vinci in the late 1400's. He designed an ornithopter, which was a flying machine with a propeller. The first flight of a propeller-driven aircraft was made in 1678.

One of the most efficient ways to do this is to use a bitmask.

The trick is to use bitwise operations to test for prime numbers.

"Which is a bird or fish: Yellow-legged gull, Yellowfin tuna",", Shark, or a seabird?

I just watched a video clip of a yellow-legged gull attacking a shark.

I could not find any information about whether these birds are fish-eaters or not.

I know that Yellow-legged gull is a seabird, and I know that Yellowfin tuna are fish, but maybe someone can help me.

A:

From the Cornell Lab of Ornithology:

Yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) are seabirds. They eat fish, but
  generally only as a supplement to their primary diet of small
  invertebrates and crustaceans.

So they are fish eaters.

This week, the internet has been abuzz with a new report from a Chinese state magazine, which claims that the Trump administration is preparing to impose tariffs on $267 billion of Chinese goods, including cellphones and computers. The report, which has since been discredited and removed from the State Council’s website, was meant to “provoke a trade war.”

The report was roundly criticized and quickly debunked, and even the Chinese government has since denied it. But it’s not the first time that a report from China has been taken seriously in Washington. It’s a familiar story in the Trump era: an allegation from a foreign government, which is either denied or quickly dismissed, only to be repeated over and over again with each new president.

President Trump has a penchant for believing reports from China.

In April, Trump alleged that China had been ordering the arrest of American citizens in Hong Kong, in apparent retaliation for the Trump administration’s arrest of a Chinese executive at the request of the Chinese government. A month later, the Trump administration held a summit with China’s president, Xi Jinping, at which the two sides “reached a consensus” on trade issues. Trump told reporters that China “was going to be opening up their markets to us,” and China’s president promised to “work with the president to reach the same results.”

Then, in May, Trump claimed again that China was sending “tens of thousands” of people to the United States with the intention of targeting his supporters.

“They are trying to influence our elections. They are trying to influence other governments. They are trying to influence other companies,” Trump said in a speech at the Values V","Yellowfin tuna is a fish, Yellow-legged gull is a bird",0.424093,0.994218,7.004358,0.986596,0.520676,1.985988,-5.325606822967529

Which major league baseball season is considered Sid Gordon's breakout year?,"a

Rodrigo Díaz was the Yankees' best prospect heading into the 2017 season. However, he struggled with shoulder soreness and didn't break out until late in the year. Could he be ready for a big breakout year in 2018? Thanks to the help of our prospect experts, we will find out.

The Yankees are very much in the market for starting pitching, but their rotation is still looking like their biggest weakness heading into the 2018 season. A good portion of the Yankees top prospects are in Double-A or Triple-A right now, but we have a few experts who believe one of these young pitchers could break out as a top-of-the-rotation starter in 2018.

The Yankees are a complicated team. They have a ton of prospects in Triple-A and Double-A, but a number of them are not ready for the majors. This leads to a lot of frustration for Yankees fans, and there is little doubt that the team is struggling to find its footing.

After a dismal 2017 season, the Yankees are looking for the 2018 season to be a reset year. With a number of prospects in Triple-A and Double-A who have not yet broken out, the club is looking to make some changes in the upper levels of the farm system.

The Yankees have a number of prospects in Triple-A and Double-A who are locked in as potential back-end of the rotation starters. However, the club is well aware that some of these pitchers will need to move to the bullpen in order to remain in the majors.

The Yankees have a number of prospects on the way up, but they are also looking to make some transactions in the upper levels of the farm system. One of the players that may move up this offseason is right-hander CJ Abrams.

The Yankees have a number of starting pitchers on their 40-man roster, but none of them are locks for a big league spot in 2018. The club will look to make a couple of transactions in order to improve the depth of the starting rotation.

Free-agent starting pitcher Michael Pineda will likely need to sign a one-year deal, but the Yankees may also want to look to sign him to a multi-year deal. The club is also looking to add some bullpen help before spring training.

The Yankees are in the market for starting pitching, but they might be interested in adding a veteran starter or two in the middle","Sid Gordon during his second stint with the New York Giants in 1948 had one of the best all around hitting performance seasons in mayor league baseball history.

       A jury found defendant John Joseph Martin guilty of assault with force likely to

cause great bodily injury (Pen. Code, § 245, subd. (a)(4))1 and the trial court found true

a personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon allegation (§ 12022, subd. (b)(1)).

The trial court found true an allegation that defendant had a prior conviction for assault

by means likely to produce great bodily injury (former § 245, subd. (a)(1)). The trial

court denied a defense motion to strike the prior conviction allegation and sentenced

defendant to an aggregate term of six years in prison.

involuntary intoxication as a defense to assault with force likely to cause great bodily

injury. We conclude the court did not err; the court instructed the jury on voluntary

intoxication. However, we conclude the court should have instructed on involuntary

intoxication sua sponte.

I personally wouldn’t let a young child go to see these. These are classics for adults, not kids.
I believe the only one that is really meant for kids I would say is Aladdin. But what I really want to watch is the new version of Jungle Book, but that is not the same movie.

At present, paper and other sheet products are tested in a number of ways. For example, a sheet of paper may be folded, stuck on a piece of card, and the resulting stack of folded sheets or cards may be manually inspected. Alternatively, a sheet of paper may be inspected by an optical scanner, and the resulting image may be visually inspected or the image may be analyzed using a computer. However, the manual methods of inspection are time consuming and the optical scanners are expensive.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,325 discloses an apparatus for testing the quality of sheet products that is capable of automatically inspecting the quality of a sheet of paper. The apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,325 includes a sheet handling apparatus for feeding a sheet of paper into engagement with a pair of sensors which are movable back and forth along a pair of parallel paths. The sensors are adapted to detect and analyze image information obtained by scanning a sheet of paper placed between the sensors. Each sensor produces a signal indicating the quality of the sheet of paper detected by the sensor.

"Given the reference text below, what is Air Jordan?",", A. So, we are going to focus on the last part of this verse, worship, which is the third part of the Hebrew word, shalom. The word shalom is the most commonly used word in the Christian Bible. It is a word that means peace, wholeness, harmony, well-being, comfort, and safety. In the New Testament, the word shalom is used to refer to the peace that comes from being a Christian.

Air Jordan 3 for sale, In the New Testament, shalom is used in a very different way than it is used in Hebrew. In Hebrew, shalom is used to refer to the peace that comes from being in relationship with God. In the New Testament, shalom is used to refer to the peace that comes from being in relationship with each other.

However, you can see that the two meanings of the word shalom are very similar. In fact, in the Old Testament, shalom is used the same way in both Hebrew and English. In the Old Testament, the word shalom is used to refer to the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is the place where God dwells among His people. The kingdom of God is a place where God’s presence and power are felt and enjoyed.

Air Jordan 3 for sale, The kingdom of God is where heaven and earth come together. It is where the peace that comes from God’s presence is felt. It is where the peace that comes from being in relationship with God is experienced. It is where the peace that comes from being in relationship with one another is experienced.

What are the potential source of energy for an engine?,"

A:

There are many different ways to generate energy, but one of the most common is burning fossil fuels (like gas, oil, coal).  Other sources of energy include solar (like panel/solar panels), wind (like wind turbines), nuclear (like nuclear reactors), hydroelectric, and biofuels.  
An engine uses fuel to create useful work.  When you burn fossil fuels like gasoline, the molecules are broken down into simpler molecules that can be carried by the engine to create useful work.  The energy for this comes from the fuel itself, but it takes a lot of energy to break down the molecules of a fossil fuel, so the engine needs to be able to work hard to keep the fuel fed in for it to work.  The work that is done by the engine is the useful work it can produce.  The useful work is measured in horsepower (hp) and torque (in lbs or kg).  The engine is designed to convert the useful work into the power it needs to run the thing.
As for the potential sources of energy for an engine, you can imagine that if you had a nuclear reactor to power your engine, that would be a pretty good source of energy.  It would be easy to produce, and could be a useful way to produce a lot of useful work.
The potential sources of energy are the energy that that you can get out of a system that is doing useful work.  The faster the system does the useful work, the more energy can be extracted from it.  
For example, if you have a solar panel, you can generate electricity for your engine.  The electricity is the useful work that is being done by the solar panel.  The more useful work the solar panel does, the more electricity it can produce, and the more useful work a nuclear reactor can do, the more electricity it can produce.

Decentralisation of power is a great idea. But we need to be careful that the Central government does not abuse this power and become the centre of the development in the country. What the government should do is to encourage decentralisation of power in such a way that it does not bring corruption in the system.

There is a need to strengthen the system of checks and balances. With the introduction of the concept of transparency in the system, corruption levels will automatically reduce. Another important aspect that needs to be improved is that the system of checking on the implementation of projects should be done more effectively. This will help in checking the corrupt practices that bring several projects to a standstill.

The Indian political system has evolved to a certain extent. But the system has still to evolve further to bring about a change in the country. The country has to move towards a more democratic system where power is shared among the people of the country. In the current scenario, the government has to be more responsive towards the people. The government should be more transparent in its functioning. The implementation of the projects should be effective and the corruption level should be reduced.

What is the origin of the name of the herb Rosemary?," (rhóse-äm)

A:

I figured this out after a little bit more research. Rosemary is named after the Latin word ros marinus, which means ""sea rose"". The plant is most commonly associated with the sea. The Romans would use the plant to make perfume and the perfume would also be used to scent linen. 
It is still associated with the sea today, and the plant is sometimes called ""sea rosemary"" when used for scented linen.

Q:

Is it possible to view the size of a file in Terminal?

I recently ran into a problem where I forgot to give my pictures a name. Since I was working from a flash drive, I just assumed that it would save the files as ""IMG_0000.jpg"" and that the file size was the same as the name. But when I checked the file size in Finder, it didn't match what it was supposed to be.
Now, I know how to find the size of a file in Terminal by using du. But is there a way to view the size of a file in Terminal?

A:

It's called ls -l. You can find it in the man page.
$ ls -l file

If you want to know the size of a file in one command, you can use du, in combination with --apparent-size.
This will report a size of the file, but it does not take into account what it really takes up on the filesystem.
$ du -sh file
28K file

$ du --apparent-size file
28K file

Note that this will not work with the -a option, which will report the size of the files, including hidden files.
$ du -sh file
28K file

$ du --apparent-size -a file
28K file

There is a command called du. It pretty much does what you want.

How to display image in fragment

I am developing an image sharing app. I have a fragment that displays the image.
I have a button that opens a new activity to share the image.
I have two different ways of doing this.
In the first way I use the intent to open the new activity, and I add the image file to the new activity by using the intent. This is the way I do it :
Intent shareIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
shareIntent.setType(""image/png"");
shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, imageURI);
startActivity(Intent.createChooser(shareIntent, ""Share Image""));

In the second way, I open the new activity by clicking the image, and I get the URI directly from the image (the imageUri variable).
How can I do this in both ways?

A:

The other way is:
Intent shareIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
shareIntent.setType(""image/png"");
Uri imageUri = FileProvider.getUriForFile(ShareActivity.this, ""com.example.mycompany.fileprovider"", file);
shareIntent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, imageUri);

""Well, we had to know that one. But why do you think that is?"" I asked.

What are some things to remember when buying a new pair of headphones?,".alibaba.com/en/blog/2017/08/what-to-be-careful-when-buying-headphones

In order to make the right choice, it is important to understand the differences between the various types of headphones.

The three main categories of headphones are closed-back, open-back and over-ear.

Closed-back headphones totally seal off the ear canal and the ear, so all the sound is directed back into the headphones. This helps to minimise hearing loss in the long run.

Open-back headphones do not completely seal off the ear, but only partially block out some of the sound. This type of headphones can help with hearing loss, but is not recommended for prolonged listening.

Over-ear headphones completely cover the ear and seal off the ear canal. This helps to reduce ambient noise and makes it easier to hear yourself when you are on the phone or in a noisy environment.

Most people find these headphones to be uncomfortable to wear for long periods. This is because they make it uncomfortable to have a conversation with someone who is nearby, and because they are also heavy and hot.

Some people like to have their headphones with them when they are on the move, but they can cause a great deal of damage to your ears if you are listening to music for long periods of time.

On the other hand, many people find that they are not comfortable wearing headphones when they are sitting down, watching TV, or reading.

The main reason for this is that they make it difficult to hear what is going on around you.

For this reason, many people find that they prefer to listen to their music using Bluetooth headphones, which allow them to listen to music without wearing headphones.

There are a number of different brands that sell Bluetooth headphones.

There are also some brands that focus on producing sports headphones. The main difference between these and regular headphones is that they are designed for use in exercising.

For example, the Bose SoundSport headphones are designed for use while running, and the Beats by Dre Studio headphones are designed for use while exercising in a gym.

Most of the products on the market today are comparatively cheap, and they do not tend to last very long.

For this reason, it is important to get the best quality headphones for the money.

The right headphones are usually made of high quality material such as aluminium, titanium, or some other metal that","There are many criteria when one can keep in mind when purchasing headphones.
1. Purpose: the purpose of usage should be clear in mind, i.e., whether it's for hearing good quality music or for work like taking video calls.
2. Price Performance: Money is always an important consideration when it comes to any sort of purchase.
3. Active Noise cancellation (ANC): Although noise cancellation is coming with most headsets nowadays, the quality of ANC might vary from one piece to another. So it's always good to read some reviews around it.
4. Mobile application and features: It is almost a norm now that every major headset company has developed the corresponding mobile application with some add-on features. But some companies offer much for fine-grained controls than others.
5. Carry case: If you are a frequent traveller, then a compact and robust headset carry case might be good to have in certain situations.",0.071966,0.991105,20.807591,0.911092,0.074644,4.57128,-5.150519847869873

The 29-year-old man told police he was walking down the street when he was approached by a man he knows.

The two men argued and the man said the man punched him in the head.

The man was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Police said there were no signs of other violence.

A witness at the scene told CP24 he saw the two men arguing and then the man who was punched walk away.

Police said the investigation is ongoing.

Rideau-Vanier ward Coun. Mathieu Fleury said he thinks the incident is isolated.

He said the home where the incident occurred is a nice area with lots of homes and businesses, and is not known for being a high crime area.

“I think, overall, this is a very safe area,” Fleury said. “I don’t think it is the type of area that is known for criminality.”

As for the victim, police said he was released from hospital.

Who composed the theme song for the movie Marvin's Room?,"

Answer

He did. A song called ""The Time Has Come"" by the band ""The Time."" He also performed and recorded several other songs on Marvin's Room. Check out the answers to the previous question.---
abstract: 'We study the existence of some families of non-decreasing functions $f$, $g$ with $f(x) < g(x)$, for $x \in [0,1]$, such that $f(a) = g(a)$ for some $a \in (0,1]$. This question is motivated by the fact that the existence of such a function $f$ with $f(x) = g(x)$ for $x \in [0,1]$ is equivalent to the existence of an $f$-invariant set in the interval $[0,1]$. We prove the existence of a non-decreasing function $f$ such that $f(x) < g(x)$, for $x \in [0,1]$ and $f(a) = g(a)$ for some $a \in (0,1]$ in the following cases: (i) $f$ and $g$ are non-constant on $[0,1]$, (ii) $f$ is non-constant on $[0,1]$, $g$ is constant on $[0,1]$, (iii) $f$ has a local maximum at $a \in (0,1)$, $g$ has a local maximum at $a \in (0,1)$, (iv) $f$ is non-decreasing on $[0,1]$ and has a local maximum at $a \in (0,1)$. We obtain the same results for non-decreasing functions $f$ and $g$ with $f(x) < g(x)$, for $x \in [0,1]$, such that $f(a) = g(a) = 1/2$ for some $a \in (0,1]$. In this case we prove that such a function $f$ exists if and only if almost all intervals in $[0,1]$ have a positive measure. We also obtain the same results for non-decreasing functions $f$ and $g$ with $f(x) < g(x)$, for $x \in [0,1]$, such that $f(a) = g(a) = 1/2$ for $a \in (","The musician that composed the original music for the Marvin's room was Rachel Portoman, and Carly Simon wrote and performed the song.",0.512088,0.99613,3.635311,0.579964,0.416838,1.228066,-5.951556205749512

A:

The answer is:

 The entire universe is a book.

This is sort of a trick question, as the book is part of the universe. So ""The universe is a book"" is an answer.

 With the above in mind, it is probably easiest to explain the answer by first telling you the meaning of the words, and then giving the definitions.

The ""Galaxy"" is, of course, the galaxy next door, while ""Milky Way"" is the galaxy we live in, the one we see every day. ""Asteroid Belt"" is the belt of asteroids, ""Sombrero Galaxy"" is the galaxy that looks like a sombrero, and ""Spiral Galaxy"" is the galaxy that looks like a spiral.

 For the second half of the answer, we will first define ""Asteroid Belt"" and then define ""Spiral Galaxy.""

Asteroid Belt:

 An asteroid belt is a region of the Solar System that is defined by the orbits of the major planets of the Solar System. The asteroid belt is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The asteroid belt is known to be composed of many different types of asteroids, ranging from rocky asteroids to metallic asteroids. There are many smaller asteroids in the asteroid belt as well.

Spiral Galaxy:

 A spiral galaxy is a galaxy in which the stars are organized in a rotating disk around a central supermassive black hole. The structure of a spiral galaxy is similar to that of a spiral galaxy in the Universe. As a galaxy rotates, the stars inside the galaxy orbit the equatorial plane of the galaxy.

The book is the entire universe.

"Some families get rid of TVs and smartphones for the proper growth of children, but are those things desirable?",". It’s not TV that’s hurting kids, it’s the lack of family time that’s hurting kids. I used to be a fan of the TV-less house. But then I realized that it’s more important to spend our time together, playing, talking, and just being together. Now I can’t imagine our life without TV. I also am the first to admit that there are some shows that I would never get rid of, but those shows aren’t hurting me or my kids. I just have a hard time watching them. I’m sure you have a few shows that you watch that you wouldn’t get rid of, but maybe we can all agree to put those shows on hold until we have dinner or until after the kids go to bed.

I’m not saying we’re going to stop having time together. But maybe we can start re-evaluating how much time we’re all spending with our kids. I don’t know about you, but I would rather be playing with them then watching them play.

10. Don't get me started.

So, back to that little girl with the big smile. It has been a long time since I saw a child who is so happy. She is happy all the time. And that’s what it’s all about.

What’s the Difference Between Social Media and Content Marketing?

Social media is a tool that can be used to spread your brand’s content. Content marketing is a strategy that can be used to share content and increase traffic to your website.

When you use a social media tool like Facebook or Twitter to share your content, the content is shared with the users of that platform. When you use content marketing strategies, your content is shared across the web with users who come to your website.

What makes a Korean corn dog different from an American corn dog?,".comShopping for Korean corn dogs in the states is not easy. There are few stores carrying them, and even when they are available, the selection is limited. Even in Korea, the selection is limited. In Korea, corn dogs are not a national food, they are a regional food. They were invented by the Americans. They were a part of the American military culture. The Americans started serving them to their troops in the Korean War. They are served at the same time as fries, and every time I go to the Korean War Memorial, I stop at the hot dog stand and get a corn dog.

While most of the corn dogs served in the US are hot dogs, there is a wide variety of types. One of the most popular is the grilled corn dog, which is a grilled hot dog wrapped in a corn dog dough. The dough is made out of flour, water, and corn starch. It is rather sticky, so it takes some time to wrap the hot dog.

While Korean hot dogs are grilled, the typical American hot dog is boiled. (The hot dog vendors in Seoul boil their dogs in a large pot of boiling water.)

Korean hot dogs are also served with various toppings. I like the spicy mustard, but I have also tried the kimchi. Some people like the black bean sauce.

While it is possible to find Korean corn dogs at a few restaurants in the US, they are not widely available. Some of the best corn dogs I have eaten were at the Corn Dog Stand in Cleveland, Ohio.

For my first visit to Korea, I wanted to try one of the corn dogs from the Korean War Memorial. I was surprised to find that the Memorial was open only on the weekends. I am not sure when the Memorial reopens, but I am going to check it out on a weekend when it is not crowded.

If you are in Seoul and want to get a corn dog, here is the address:

The Memorial is open from 10 am to 5 pm on the following dates: May 15 to June 14, July 11 to August 14, September 13 to October 12, and November 10 to December 9.

  A friend of mine in the business of selling pre-paid cell phones and prepaid gift cards to college students, is looking for a new phone to replace his Blackberry.  I cannot think of a legitimate reason to spend $500-$1000 to replace a phone, unless the phone is defective.  Perhaps he feels that his Blackberry is his most personal electronic device?  If so, his feelings are legitimate, but not necessarily good for his business.  Can you please tell me why a business should not be focused on making its employees happy?
  He has a good relationship with his suppliers and customers, and does a fine job of making the phones.  Perhaps he should not be spending so much money on his personal phone.  He does not seem to have a problem with his employees.  He is open to ideas about improving the business.  
  I am sorry, but I cannot think of any legitimate reason to spend $500-$1000 on a phone, unless it is defective.
  I understand that people are emotional about their smartphones and that it is difficult to think of a legitimate business reason to spend that kind of money.  But I have to hear a convincing business argument that spending $500-$1000 on a phone is good for the business.  Please provide a business case.
  I do not like the phrase “the way we do things here”.  It makes me think that something is wrong with the way we do things here.  I do not like the phrase “do not put that in the bank” either.  It makes me think that something is wrong with the way we do business.  I do not like anything about the phrase “on the house”.  It makes me think that the business is trying to get something for nothing, which is not good for my business.
  I understand that capitalism is a tough business, but I believe that there is a fundamental difference between a good business and a bad business.  The difference between a good business and a bad business is that a good business is focused on making money and a bad business is focused on making people happy.  We produce good products and good services, and we try to make our employees happy.  That is the right way to do business.

accomplishments yet pursuing improvements (Haidt, J.) Putting that together, then, who is responsible for writing this story?

San Francisco's Fillmore District

The Fillmore District is a neighborhood in the South of Market area of San Francisco, California, located between Mission and Potrero Hill. It is roughly bounded on the north by Hayes Valley, on the west by the Port of San Francisco, and on the south by the Transbay Terminal. It extends from San Francisco's Civic Center to Golden Gate Park in the east and Mission Street to the Fillmore District in the west.

The Fillmore District was first referred to as ""SOMA"", an abbreviation of San Francisco's Mission and Ocean Park neighborhoods. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the neighborhood was a haven for artists and alternative subcultures, with the likes of CBGB and Throb Records. It became a center of the San Francisco punk rock movement, and was the scene of many concerts by bands such as The Ramones, The Dead Boys, The Cramps, X, The Mumps, and The Vibrators.

The Fillmore District has become a tourist attraction in its own right, as a","Analog signal- radio waves, television waves, sound waves

Where can I find more information on Tau?,"arama.com/tautravel.htm)

I'm really not a fan of the ""adventure"" sort of travel, so I'd really like to see more details on what they're doing.

To me, adventure travel is made up of different types of travel:

1. an already established route2. one that was established in the past, but has been updated to keep up with the times3. one that is completely new to the area4. a combination of 1, 2, and 3

I saw the ad on the front page of the website, and I was interested in the first travel type, but I'm not sure if that's what they offer. I know I've seen things on the site about new routes in the past, but I don't remember the details.

The site is really easy to navigate. The one thing that strikes me as a bit odd is that they list the ""places"" that they have visited, but not the ""places"" they're exploring. I know that there are a lot of places in Argentina that they haven't been to yet, and I don't know if they're planning to cover those places in the future or not.

I think that it's a good idea to be able to see the places that they've visited so far, but I would also like to see the places that they are planning to visit.

I'd also like to see more details on the expedition itself, such as the people who are involved, how difficult the route will be, etc.

I'm looking forward to seeing the details. Thanks for your feedback.

Give me ideas how I could become more productive.,"@gmail.com

A:

I would suggest a two-pronged approach:

Get to know the ins and outs of your chosen language. This will help you approach the task at hand with a greater understanding of what is actually happening. Reading blogs, books, or (better) even the source code is a great way to learn the language.
Find a way to practice. It doesn't have to be a full-blown application, but even something as simple as implementing a method, or writing a few lines of code is a good way to improve your skill.

I would also consider trying to avoid repeating the same mistakes, as that could potentially be a sign of a lack of understanding.

A:

Any time you feel like you've hit a wall, look for the root cause. If you feel like you're losing your mind in a language, look at your code. If you're not quite sure what you're doing, look at the code you're writing. If you're not sure what to do and you can't find the answer anywhere, you're not trying hard enough.
As for what to do, I have a few suggestions:

Read the source code for the language you're working with. Make sure you understand the idioms and common patterns that the language uses. This helps you understand the language better, and will help you when you're trying to write it yourself.
Read the source code for other projects. Keep your eyes open for common patterns and idioms, and look for ways you could reuse their techniques.
Review your design. Look for places you're repeating yourself and looking for ways to reduce the number of lines of code you need to write.

For Java, I would suggest looking at the code in the JDK.

A:

I can't help much with the specifics of Java, but I can comment on how I approach things.
I'm a self-taught programmer. I was not a CS major or anything like that. I picked up programming as a hobby. I've been working as a programmer for about a decade. I've worked on (and written) a lot of code, a lot of it self-taught, and a lot of it through other tutorials and books. In all this time, I've learned a lot of techniques and methods which I hope will be helpful to you.
I find that the most productive way to get things done is to take a few","Here are a few things you can try to become more productive:
1. Limit multitasking: While it may feel more productive, you can easily get distracted and spend more time on those tasks overall. Instead, try to complete one task to a higher standard in less time.
2. Set small goals: Large tasks can feel overwhelming which can in turn lead to procrastination. Try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and complete them one by one.
3. Take a break: It is scientifically proven that brain productivity increases after having a short break. Consider scheduling frequent short breaks of 10-15 minutes. Make sure you step away from your work environment. This will help your mind to have a rest and come up with new ideas after the break.
4. Complete the hardest task first: The most complex or hardest task can be intimidating to start with and we tend to avoid them therefore. Try to start with one of these tasks. It can energize and motivate you throughout the day, helping you accomplish a lot of smaller tasks.
5. Delegate: If you are part of a team, consider collaborating with team members more closely. Delegation",0.060367,0.879743,24.029217,0.943792,0.035457,5.189715,-5.008742809295654

Vanessa's assessment would be considered her baseline test since she has no prior experience with resistance training. Vanessa would perform the tests one at a time. She would start with the sit and reach test, which measures shoulder flexibility. She would perform the sit and reach test to the limit of her range of motion, which would be 5.5 inches. She would then perform the push-up test, which measures upper body strength. She would perform the push-ups until she cannot any further. She would then perform the curl-up test, which measures upper body endurance. She would perform the curl-ups until she cannot any further. Vanessa would then perform both the bench press and the leg press. The bench press is a chest press and leg press combination. The leg press is a leg extension and leg curl combination. Vanessa would perform the bench and leg press until she cannot any further. Vanessa would then perform the bent over row test. The bent over row test is a row using a barbell.

This is because she has experience with lifting weights. To start, she should warm up by completing several submaximal repetitions.

The final weight lifted should be the absolute 1-RM.

How to get this smoothness in the image

I have the following picture:

I have some issues with this picture.
The first is that the borders between the pictures are not smooth, they are jagged.
The second is that the red dot is not in the center of the picture.

At a simplistic level, it might appear that throwing the ball to the end zone at every opportunity is the straight forward strategy. 

However, if one did that, then the defense would adjust and accordingly defend. Also, typically the team has to move the ball 75 to 80 yards to the end zone. Only a few strong armed quarterbacks can throw that far. Even fewer can do it under pressure. The other main issue is that there is a very low chance of completing the pass. 

So, smart teams and coaches, use a variety of strategies of both throwing the ball different distances, running the ball, and based on distance, kicking field goals.

The arguments in your function are not pointers to the string.
It is just a char array.
So you need to pass the address of the array in the function.
But since you are passing a pointer to an array as the argument, you cannot use that pointer to access the elements of the array in your function.
So you need to copy the contents of the array to a new array and pass the address of that new array as the argument.","The five main centers of Sufism are India, Persia, Baghdad, Syria, and North Africa.",0.165281,0.993532,1.028528,0.083922,0.152104,0.484674,-12.17614459991455

Q:

How to access a property of an instance of a Dictionary?

I have a Dictionary where I'm storing some data of type A. I want to access the property of an instance of type B
var dict = new Dictionary<int, A>();

I want to be able to access the property of type B from the instance of type A. Is there a way to do this?

A:

You can cast the key to type B, and then access the property of type B of the instance of A that the key is mapped to.
var dict = new Dictionary<int, A>();
var b = (B)dict[1];
b.property = ""the value"";

A:

You can use reflection to do this.  The code below prints ""2"" to the console:

class A {
    public int Value { get; set; }
}

class B {
    public string Property { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var dict = new Dictionary<int, A>();
        var a = dict[1] as A;
        var b = (B)dict[1];
        b.Property = ""Whiskers"";
        Console.WriteLine(a.Value);
        Console.WriteLine(b.Property);

Extract the names of the teams Alexandra Oquendo was a part of from the text. Separate them with a comma.," them together and build a string. Then read the string as a JSON.

team1,team2,team3,team4

The team names, comma quoted.

team1,team2,team3,team4

The team names, unquoted.

**This is the JavaScript code. It searches for team names in the text, then builds an array of the results. As you add new team names to the teams array, the JavaScript running the code will update the names in the teams array.**

**The JavaScript code uses the** **.replace()** **method to replace the team names with a comma.**

**The JavaScript code uses the** **.split()** **method to split the comma-quoted team names into separate strings.**

**The JavaScript code uses the** **.join()** **method to build a comma-delimited string of the team names.**

**The JavaScript code uses the** **.match()** **method to do a regular expression match of the comma-delimited string. The** **.test()** **method returns a Boolean value (true or false).**

**The JavaScript code uses the** **.replace()** **method to replace the comma with a comma-and-space. It also uses** **.split()** **to split the comma-and-space string, and** **.join()** **to put the results back together.**

If you replace the team names in the text, the JavaScript will update the names in the teams array.

The JavaScript code is very easy to write. It is simple, and the code is relatively easy to read, too.

The JavaScript code is not very efficient. It calls the** **.split()** **method, which is slow. It calls the** **.replace()** **method, which is slow.

It also uses regular expressions (regexes), which are slow.

### Note

Regular expressions are a powerful tool, but they are an advanced programming technique. If your goal is to write fast JavaScript, you should avoid regular expressions.

Drinkers like IPAs for their complex flavors which can vary depending on style from East Coast or West Cost, dry hopped or hazy.

What is the Barkley Marathons?,"

The Barkley Marathons is a series of running events around the world, and in the United States, that aim to raise money and awareness for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and the Sickle Cell Disease and Allied Disorders Association, two of the largest organizations dedicated to the study, treatment and cure of blood diseases. Each event is named after the late Dr. James B. Barkley, a leukemia surgeon and one of the founding members of the Blood Center, who served as its first president. Over the course of the events, thousands of runners run across the country, all to raise money and awareness for the organizations that Dr. Barkley helped to found.

The Barkley Marathons began in New York City in 1987, and have since spread to other locations around the world. The Marathons are held in the spring and fall of each year, and are broken down into shorter events throughout the year. The Marathons are run exclusively on public roads. A number of the races include a race walk, which is a race in which participants run in a manner similar to a marathon, but walk at a speed which is less than the average pace of a marathon. The walk portion of the race is for charity, and generally funds the charity in question.

History
The first Barkley Marathons was held in 1987 in New York City. The first running event was held in a park near the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's headquarters. The event was named in honor of Dr. James B. Barkley, a leukemia surgeon and the founding member of the Leukaemia Research Fund, who served as the first president of the organization. It became a yearly event in 1988, and has since grown to be one of the largest events of its kind.

In January 2015, the Barkley Marathons held its 50th running. The Marathons were held in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

In the United States, the Barkley Marathons are usually held in the spring or fall. The first Barkley was held in April 1987, and the first running event to feature a walk was held in August of the same year. Since the inaugural event, the Marathons have been held in New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

The Barkley Marathons have been held in other countries as well. The first events to occur in other countries have been held in Austria in 1987, and Australia in 1990.","The Barkley Marathons is a foot race created by Gary Cantrell and Karl Henn, and named after a friend of Gary's, Barry Barkley (who died in 2019). This race was inspired from James Earl Ray's escape from the Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in 1977 (he was in-prisoned there for the murder of Martin Luther King Jr). During his 54.5 hour escape, Earl Ray could only cover 12 miles. Cantrell thought he could have done 100 miles in this time, which gave him the idea to organise a foot race in this area.

However, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial.

The first step in the design of a new inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is the identification of a binding site on the enzyme. The binding site is the binding site for the template-primer and nucleotide analogs.

The second step is the design of a binding site for these analogs on the enzyme. This site should be sufficiently large to accommodate the analogs and sufficiently small to bind the analogs strongly.

In the third step, the binding site for the analogs is transferred to the RT-inhibitor complex. To accomplish this, the analogs are linked to the RT-inhibitor complex by using a linker.

In the fourth step, the binding site for the analogs is transferred to the wild-type RT-inhibitor complex. The linkers are designed to hydrolyze in the presence of the wild-type enzyme, thereby releasing the analogs. The analogs are redesigned and linked to the wild-type RT-inhibitor complex.

Like Armstrong, Aldrin spent just over two hours outside the lunar module, conducting experiments and collecting samples.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was both exhilarating and challenging. He described the lunar landscape as ""magnificent desolation,"" with vast, barren plains and towering mountains in the distance. Aldrin also noted the difficulty of moving around in the bulky spacesuit and the constant hissing sound of his oxygen supply.

Despite these challenges, Aldrin managed to conduct experiments and collect samples that would later be used to study the Moon's geology and history. He also took photographs and planted the American flag on the lunar surface.

Aldrin's experience on the Moon was a testament to human resilience and the spirit of exploration. He, along with Armstrong and the rest of the Apollo 11 team, pushed the boundaries of what was possible and opened up new frontiers for science and discovery.

Is tempeh a vegetarian food?,"I'm a vegan! but I don't eat tofu or tempeh. Do I have to avoid these foods too?Yes, some people who are vegan for ethical reasons may choose to avoid tempeh and tofu. But it's important to remember that one or two of these foods won't make a huge difference to your diet. Most of the foods that vegans eat are really tasty and are available in a variety of convenient forms. So you can enjoy a nice meal every day and still be a vegan!

What is soy?Soy is one of the most common foods that vegans have to avoid because it contains a plant product (soybeans) that is produced from a species of plants in the legume family. If you avoid soy and other legumes, you'll still be able to eat a wide variety of foods. You can find more information on soy and other legumes in the nutritional information box at the back of this book.

What about eggs and dairy?Most vegans eat a diet that includes both eggs and dairy. Eggs are a good source of protein and contain all the essential amino acids (which are necessary for building and repairing your body). Dairy has a good balance of protein, calcium, and fat and, like eggs, is a good source of essential amino acids. The recipes in this book use both eggs and dairy. If you choose to avoid either of these foods, you may find it easier to make substitutions like beans and nuts.

Who was Thales?,".com

“…Because of the apparent lack of evidence, it is possible that Thales did not exist at all, or that he was a fictional character with no historical basis.

“…The most common theory is that Thales was a real person, but that he was a leader in the Athenian navy during the early part of the 5th century BC.

“…The account of Thales’ discovery of the water-clock is mentioned in the work of the philosopher, writer, and critic Xenophanes (c. 570-480 BC).

“…The philosopher Heraclitus (c. 535-475 BC) stated that Thales was the first person to have brought knowledge of the world.

“…Heraclitus was the first to write about the nature of change. Thales, on the other hand, was the first to discover that water is H2O.

“…The differences between Thales and Heraclitus were becoming more apparent, and in the 4th century BC, the philosopher Plato (c. 428-347 BC) created the story of Thales and his discovery of the world’s first water-clock.

“…Plato was a great philosopher and writer. He wrote about the nature of truth, the nature of justice, and the causes of change.

“…Plato’s theory of “Forms” helped to define the concept of the Platonic universe, which is still used today.

“…Plato’s theory of the Forms is based on the concept of The Idea (ἰδέα).

“…The concept of the Idea (ἰδέα) was developed by Plato. The Idea (ἰδέα) is an eternal form that exists as a universal concept.

“…The Idea (ἰδέα) is a perfect model of a thing.

“…The Idea (ἰδέα) is a concept that is based on the perception of the heart and the soul.

What public health inventions did Louis Pasteur contribute to society?,".

Answer:

Louis Pasteur is one of the most important medical research scientists in the world today. He developed important germ theory, which revolutionized the medical field, and is credited with saving millions of lives. Pasteur's work with rabies and anthrax is credited with saving thousands of lives. He is the founder of pasteurization and is responsible for many other medical advances.

Pasteur is one of the most important figures in the history of medicine. His work on germ theory revolutionized the world, and he became a hero of the scientific community. He was a very important figure in the early days of bacteriology, and he created the first germ theory of disease. He is also credited with developing methods of preventing and treating rabies and anthrax. These methods are still used today, and he also discovered that heating milk could kill harmful bacteria. Pasteur is considered one of the fathers of microbiology, and he is credited with saving many lives in the early 20th century. Pasteur is known as one of the most important medical researchers of all time.

He was able to learn quickly, and he became famous for his ability to talk to many different people about their work.

Pasteur was well known for his work with rabies, and he was a key figure in the development of this disease. He discovered that the disease could be treated with heat, and he was able to use his knowledge of germ theory to help scientists treat the disease. He invented a method of treating rabies with heat, and he developed a vaccine to treat people who were bitten by a rabid dog. This vaccine is still used today, and it is one of the most successful vaccines ever developed.

Despite growing to 17000 employees, Salesforce managed to retain its core culture. It also responded to external challenges, especially against the competition, as Salesforce today competes in the CRM industry and emerged as a viable alternative to AWS. Salesforce relies more heavily on bureaucratic control mechanisms than clan and market control. Salesforce divided itself into functional units, namely, Product, Customer, People, Strategy, and Revenue. It does have some core focus areas, like the public sector as an industry vertical. Even though Salesforce, when viewed through a rational lens, is a bureaucratic organization, it is designed for flexibility, i.e, organic design. The decision-making is pushed down to the business unit rather than being driven by the top management. Salesforce’s Tableau and Slack acquisitions are adaptive, quick, innovative, and much required in a changing and complex environment. With Slack and Tableau, Salesforce has an edge against other cloud providers in the platform space.",0.014561,0.089959,51.149556,0.834078,0.013741,10.420379,-6.722992897033691

What was the Hundred Years War like?

Why did Edward I order the building of castles?

Edward I was a very powerful king. He was very successful in war, and he conquered most of France. When he conquered the country, he took over the government and made it a part of England. He made his son the king, and he began to rule that country as well.

Who was Edward V?

Edward V was the son of Edward IV. He was a very powerful king. He was successful in war, and he conquered most","The English and French fought from the mid-14th century well into the 15th century. The English king reigned over not only the British islands but in Normandy, France. (Read up on William the Conqueror for the story of how that came to be.) The result of this continental foothold meant that the English fought mostly in France, from Brittany to the south of France, and east towards Flanders.

Fighting in this time was particularly brutal. ""Men at Arms"" were knights, wearing full suits of armor. Supporting these Men at Arms were crossbowman (on the French side) and archers, using the English War Bow, on the English side. The War Bow was an extremely powerful weapon.",0.621671,0.996086,31.054349,0.996112,0.649135,6.863471,-5.022574424743652
What is the average interest rate for a 30 year mortgage in the United States?,"ter:

this is a very easy question. The interest rate on a 30 year mortgage is a function of two things. The first is the interest rate you are offered and the second is the down payment you make.

The down payment is the portion of the mortgage you pay that goes toward the principal. It is the amount the lender reduces the loan by before it is approved for the mortgage.

The interest rate is the rate you are charged for borrowing. It is calculated by multiplying the number of months in the loan term by the interest rate.

So, let’s take an example of a hypothetical mortgage that has a rate of 4% and a term of 30 years. The interest rate is 4% x 30 = 120%

(4% x 30) / 100 = 120% / 100 = 1.2%

The total interest paid on the mortgage is 120%

so that is 12% of the principal. That is the total interest paid on the mortgage, so it is the number that is divided by 100.

The down payment is the amount that is paid toward the principal.

In this example, the down payment is 20% of the mortgage.

(20%) / 100 = 20% / 100 = 0.2%

Now, we’re ready to compute the interest rate.

120% / 100 = 120% / 120% = 1.2%

So, the interest rate is 1.2%

Let’s take a look at another example. Let’s say you are offered a mortgage with a rate of 4.5% and a term of 20 years. The interest rate is 4.5% x 20 = 90%

(4.5% x 20) / 100 = 90% / 100 = 9%

The down payment is the amount that is paid toward the principal.

So, in this example, the down payment is 5.5% of the mortgage.

(5.5%) / 100 = 5.5% / 100 = 0.055%

So, the interest rate is 9% / 100 = 0.09%

Now, let’s take a look at a third example. Let’s say you are offered a mortgage with a rate of 4.5% and a term of 30 years. The interest rate is 4.5% x 30 = 145%

(4.5% x 30)","The average interest rate for a 30 year mortgage in the United States as of Tuesday, March 28th is 7.9%.

What is the difference between ""zum"" and ""zu"" (""zu"" = ""to, in"")

I have seen some sentences where the verb is ""zum"" and some where the verb is ""zu"".  Do they have the same meaning?

A:

zum is used to refer to the point in space that is in the direction of a point in space.  It is used for example in ""Ich bin zur Situation geraten, um zu meiner Mutter zu gelangen"" (I'm in the right place to get to my mother).
zu is used to refer to the point in space that is in the direction of a point in time.  It is used for example in ""Ich bin zur Zeit zu einem Punkt gefahren, um zu meiner Mutter zu gelangen"" (I'm at a certain point in time to get to my mother).
So, they are not used to refer to the same thing, but they are used in the same contexts for similar meanings.  

A:

zu is the past tense of the verb zubereiten, which means to prepare, or to prepare in advance, to cook.
zum is the past tense of the verb zumachen, which means to arrive, or to arrive in advance, to get there.

Give me some ideas to manage my manager.,"
I have a manager that is really a pain in the butt. I don’t know how to
manage him. I have tried to tell him that he needs to go and get a life,
but he won’t listen. He is constantly complaining about the lack of
food in the office and how we are not doing anything. I don’t know what
to do. I have tried to tell him about the problems in the office and how
we need to work together, but he doesn’t seem to care. I have also tried
to tell him that we need to talk to our boss about our problems, but he
seems to be afraid of him. I have tried to tell him how many times he
has asked us to do things and we haven’t done them, but he seems to think
that we have done them. How can I manage him?

Dear Little Man,

I have a friend at my office. We are both in our 40’s and
have been working here for 10 years. We have a great rapport with each
other, but he recently started to act very differently. He won’t let me
in on the joke, and he even told his wife that I had been talking about
him behind his back. He seems to think that I am trying to sabotage him
and take credit for his ideas. I am not saying anything behind his back.
I am just sharing the ideas that I have. How do I get him to let me in
on the joke?

Dear Witty,

I have a friend who is from India and he is a very
religious person. He has some friends who are not as religious, and they
have been having a lot of fun teasing him. They have made some comments
about his religion, and he has been getting very angry with them. I know
this guy doesn’t really mean it, but he is upset. How do I intervene to
stop the teasing?

Dear Gorgeous,

I have a friend who is very religious and is always
giving me advice. He is always telling me how to live and what to do.
I know he isn’t trying to control me, but I am getting tired of hearing
his advice. I hate to be rude, but I don’t like his advice. What do I
do?

Dear Noses,

"Make a list, using dot points, of the five foods I might find in the dairy section of a supermarket"," (I'd say no to maple syrup) and then make a list of the five foods I'd never put in my shopping basket. That way, you can concentrate on the foods you actually eat.

**3. Remember, just because something is low in carbs doesn't mean it's low in calories.**

Again, it's a matter of what you know about the food. There are many high-carb foods that are also high in calories, so just because a food is low in carbs doesn't mean it's also low in calories.

**4. Don't think in terms of a single food, think in terms of a meal.**

The best way to count carbs is to think of a meal. Think of a plateful of pasta, pasta with tomato sauce, or a plateful of pasta with a little bit of tomato sauce and some cheese. Anything that's not a single food can be part of a meal. For example, if you eat a slice of toast with jam on it, then you have eaten a small amount of fruit, which is fine. But if you eat two slices of toast with jam, then you have eaten two small portions of fruit. So, if you haven't eaten fruit, then count the carbs from the bread and jam. To work out the number of carbs from the other foods in the meal, add them all up together.

**5. If you're really worried, use a food diary.**

If you have a food diary, write down everything you eat. It's the only way to accurately work out your total carb intake. If you really, really want to get to grips with counting carbs, though, a food diary is not the way to do it. A food diary will only give you the illusion of accuracy.

* * *

* * *

**A FOOD DIARY is NOT the way to do it.**

**6. Don't look for the lowest carb products. Look for the lowest calorie products.**

Low-carb products are often high in calories. For example, some low-carb products are high in fat or protein as well as carbs. This is because the manufacturer has replaced some of the carbs with fats or proteins. So look for products that are low in calories, not just low in carbs.

"According to Hofstadter what is the theme of the book Gödel, Escher, Bach?"," and the limits of human understanding.

A large number of people have already read the book. The basic theme of the book is the nature of knowledge. The book is divided into three main sections.

In the first section, Hofstadter discusses the limits of human understanding. For example, he discusses the inability of humans to have an exhaustive understanding of various subjects. Hofstadter also discusses the limits of human understanding of the self. Hofstadter also argues that there is a fundamental difference between the way humans perceive reality and the way reality is perceived by machines.

In the second section, Hofstadter discusses the role of the unconscious in human behavior. He discusses a number of different phenomena associated with the unconscious and concludes that the unconscious is not a single unit of behavior, but rather, that the unconscious is comprised of a number of different mechanisms.

In the third section, Hofstadter discusses the relationship between music and mathematics. Hofstadter argues that the relationship between music and mathematics is an example of the way in which the unconscious and the conscious mind work in concert to produce human behavior.

In the beginning of the book, Hofstadter discusses a number of different theories of human behavior and argues that none of these theories is adequate. Hofstadter argues that language is the only method that human beings have to communicate about their thoughts. Hofstadter argues that humans are incapable of having an exhaustive understanding of reality. Hofstadter also argues that humans are incapable of having an exhaustive understanding of the unconscious.

What did Britain swap Havana for with Spain in 1763,"

The Castilian colony in the Caribbean town of Havana was the last destination for Christopher Columbus before he reached the New World. The Spanish Crown gave it to Britain in exchange for Havana, then the capital of the colonies of Florida and Louisiana. The agreement was made on March 2, 1763, to end a war between the two nations. The return of Havana to Spain in exchange for the colonies, which was signed on January 20, was the last transaction between the two countries.

The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714)

Britain and Spain were at war in the first years of the 1700s. In the British Isles, the Hanoverian dynasty, which was the rightful heir to the throne, was challenged by the House of Bourbon, which claimed the throne through the French king. The French monarch, Louis XIV, supported the Bourbons and Spain, while the British had France and Spain on their side.

The War of the Spanish Succession was the first of several wars between the two countries. The first battle of the war was fought on March 16, 1702, near the city of Culloden, in Scotland. The second was in 1704, near the city of Oudenaarde, Belgium. In 1705, the Spanish army commanded by Philip V of Spain defeated the British army led by the Duke of Marlborough and the Duke of Ormonde at the battle of Blenheim. The fighting continued until 1709, with no overall winner.

The War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718-1748)

In 1718, King Philip V of Spain, who had been defeated in the War of the Spanish Succession, was aided by England, France, and Holland in an attack on Naples. The Spanish army defeated the Neapolitans and seized their capital. The British alliance, which was formed in 1718, was the first of many in which England and the other European countries were allied against a common enemy.

The War of the Polish Succession (1733-1739)

The War of the Polish Succession was a conflict between the Austrian Habsburgs and the Kingdom of Poland, which was ruled by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Habsburgs claimed the throne of the Commonwealth through the intermediation of the Holy Roman Empire, which held the title of emperor.

Cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in the US. No other illegal drug comes close to its usage.

The use of cannabis, sometimes known as marijuana or weed, has been an important part of American history. Cannabis was first discovered in the Americas in 1535 and was used to treat ailments. Early on, the use of cannabis was outlawed in the US. Cannabis was used widely by the Native Americans and was also used by the American soldiers during the American Revolution.

While cannabis was once illegal in the US, it became legal again in America with the passing of the 2014 Marijuana Justice Act. The law legalized the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. This allowed people with certain illnesses to use cannabis.

Cannabis is also very popular in the medical field and is used for treating conditions such as cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy, HIV, and chronic pain. Many states have legalized the use of cannabis for medical purposes.

What are some common software pricing models?,".com

Pricing models are a means to calculate the price of software. They are designed to help companies provide software at competitive prices, while also making sure that the company is making a profit.

There are two main types of pricing models:

  *  **Cost center pricing model** : This pricing model is used when the software is installed and used by a specific department within the organization. In this model, the cost of the software is allocated to a particular department based on the usage of the software and the amount of money that department is responsible for. For example, a department's cost of software usage is calculated by multiplying the number of hours that the department uses the software by the cost of the software license.

  *  **Per-user pricing model** : This model is used when the software is used by multiple users. In this model, the software is licensed for each user in the organization. The cost is calculated based on the number of users and the usage of the software.

You can see a more detailed explanation of pricing models on Wikipedia.

## What is an example of a cost center pricing model?

For this example, we will use a project management application as an example.

### Note

For the purpose of this example, we will use the term _project management application_ to refer to a software product that has a set of tools for project management. We will not use the term _project management tool_.

Let's say that you are developing a product that has a cost of $5 per user. Your project management application has three features:

  *  **Project planning** : The feature provides the project manager with a user interface to create and maintain a project plan.

  *  **Project tracking** : The feature provides the project manager with a user interface to track the status of the project.

  *  **Issue tracking** : The feature provides the project manager with a user interface to track the status of the issues in the project.

These features are used by the project manager to manage the project.

Each of these features is used by the project manager. The feature is used by the project manager in the following ways:

  *  **Project planning** : The project manager uses the project planning feature to create a project plan. The project planning feature also calculates a number of times that the project manager uses the project planning feature during the course of the project.

  *  **Project tracking","There are many types of software pricing models, but broadly they can be divided into three categories: perpetual, subscription, and consumption.

Perpetual software pricing models, also known as perpetual licensing models, allow the software to be purchased for a one-time fee.  Typically the buyer has nearly unlimited use of the software in perpetuity.  If updates to the software are required, a separate software maintenance package may be purchased.

Subscription software allows unlimited use of the software for a predetermined period, often 1 year or 3 years, for a price.  Updates to the software are often included in the price of the subscription.  At the end of the subscription term, the buyer usually has the option to renew their subscription.

Consumption-based software allows the buyer to pay for their actual usage of the software during a period of time, for example monthly.  In this type of arrangement, the actual usage can vary from period to period, resulting in customer charges that vary as well.  Some customers like knowing that they will only pay for what they use, while other customers dislike the unpredictability of their bills.",0.05085,0.935833,16.856096,0.96554,0.038421,3.769348,-5.369380950927734
Tell me about the career of David Allen Laycock,"_test@yahoo.com

""In his new book, ""The Future of Marriage and the Family,"" David Allen Laycock argues that the institution of marriage in America has been severely weakened by the decline of marriage as an exclusive economic relationship and by the rise of a new family structure, the cohabiting couple.

He argues that there is no social or economic advantage to marriage that justifies the subsidy which the American government throws at it. He also explores the question of whether children raised by parents who are cohabiting have any advantage over those raised by married parents.

Laycock, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was a co-founder of the pro-marriage-equality group Freedom to Marry and was the chief legislative lobbyist for the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). He is an expert in constitutional law and serves on the legal advisory board of the National Coalition to Reduce Class Size.

Laycock is the author of five other books, including ""The Future of Parenting: How the Rise of Single Mothers Can Set Your Kids Up for Success, ""Why Marriage Matters,"" ""The Family: The Story of Man's Search for Meaning"" and ""The Case for Marriage.""

Laycock was born at Woolwich in east London in 1847. He first played for Kent's Second XI in 1966 and went on to make his first-class cricket debut in August 1969 against Leicestershire at Canterbury.

Lol you have a point. I looked it up on the internet. The jet stream is a west to east current. The Pacific jet stream is further east than the Atlantic. The California jet stream is very cool. It is odd that the western coast of the US is colder in the winter.

Yes, you are right. I guess it's a common misconception that the Pacific is always cold off the West Coast. I remember reading about how the jet stream, the wind currents, etc., can make the Pacific much colder, sometimes, than the Atlantic.

The Gulf Stream is warm because it is fed by the Gulf of Mexico, which is one of the sunniest areas in the world. The Pacific has more land mass, so it is colder, and it is generally colder in the winter than the Atlantic.Q:

A lawyer’s background and experience are important factors in determining the quality of their legal work. A lawyer’s education, training and experience help them to develop skills and knowledge that allow them to provide legal advice and services in the area of your legal concern.

The law is a field of study in which an attorney is trained to analyze the legal effects of an event or action. The process of becoming an attorney has become significantly more difficult, with passing the bar exam, but this has not eliminated those who are incompetent and not qualified to practice law.

The first step in finding a lawyer for your legal needs is to rely on your network of friends and family. These individuals will know what type of lawyer you need and may recommend a particular attorney based on their experience or a specific area of law they specialize in.

Your local bar association has a referral service that can help you locate a local attorney. The referral service will provide you with contact information for an attorney that is local to the area in which you live or work.

The firm’s attorneys can be contacted directly by calling the firm’s main office number or by email.

You can also post information about your legal needs on the firm’s website, or on a message board or bulletin board for lawyers.

You should be aware of the fact that a lawyer’s practices are defined by the laws and rules of the state. A good rule of thumb is that a lawyer should be praised for their work if they win but criticized if they lose.

With the goal of clarifying the causes of climate change, NASA, the European Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, and the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Spain are jointly operating the Atmospheric Composition and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (AM2I, pronounced “AM-2-ee”), which will run from Sept. 1 through March 31, 2008, at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.

The project involves a number of high resolution and state-of-the-art Earth-based and space-based observation systems that will provide information on the composition and state of the atmosphere and climate, including:

The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE), which will measure the abundance and distribution of ozone and other molecules in the atmosphere. ACE also will measure trace gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methane.

The Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), which will measure the properties of clouds and aerosols, including their size, shape, and optical properties.

The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO), which will measure aerosol, ozone and methane concentrations, and their spatial and temporal variations.

The Polar Aerosol and Gas Experiment (PAGES), which will measure the chemical composition and size distribution of particles in polar regions.

The Airborne Laboratory for the Study of the Earth’s Atmosphere (ALMA), which will measure atmospheric composition and temperature profiles in the lower atmosphere.

The International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), which will provide global observations of clouds and their effect on climate.

The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) in Boulder, Colo., will measure the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere.

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, scheduled for launch in 2009, will measure the amount, type, and timing of rain and snow, and will provide the first global measurements of rainfall from space.

It depends on the health care provider.

The law states that no person can be denied medical care or health service based on a patient's inability to pay.

The law also states that if a person is seeking medical care or health services and has no insurance or the insurance does not cover the services received, the medical care or health services shall not be charged.

However, the law also states that if a person is seeking medical care or health services and has insurance, all charges for medical services or health services, including charges that would be paid by the insurance company, must be paid by the patient or the patient's legal representative.

If you have no insurance, you cannot get care at any health care provider. If you have insurance, the provider can charge the patient. It will be up to the provider to seek payment directly from the insurance company.

Setting:
A clinic, such as a minute clinic, is a small healthcare facility that provides basic medical services, including vaccinations. It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.
A pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.

Fees:
Both clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.

What is Mozart’s contribution to the music?,".com

05/25/2016

Mozart’s music has often been described as “pure” or “simple” in comparison to the music of his contemporaries, and in a way this is true. It isn’t just that his music is not as complex as that of his contemporaries, it is also that it is not as complicated as that of his contemporaries. Mozart’s music can be very rich in the sense of emotional content, but it is not especially complex in terms of the amount of detail in it.

We can see this in the first movement of his Piano Concerto No. 21. If we listen to the first movement of this concerto we can see that it has many details, and these details are not just of a musical nature, but of a linguistic nature. If we look at the words to this movement we see that they are very rich in content and detail.

The first movement of the Piano Concerto No. 21 begins with a very simple beat (1) which is soon followed by a very simple beat (2). The music of this movement is not terribly complex, but it does have a number of details, and we can easily see this as we listen to it. We can also hear these details in the words of the movement:

In the second beat (3) we have a short repeated note that is NOT the first note in the phrase (the first note in the phrase is the note A). The first note of the phrase is the note B, and the second note of the phrase is the note C. The second note of the phrase is a perfect fourth, and this is the note that the composer moves to a new note (the note D) in order to start his next phrase. The note D is not even the first note of the new phrase, it is the note E. The phrase that the composer has just started is ABABCD, so the first note of this new phrase is the note A. The composer then repeats the phrase (ABACDE) once, and then again for the last time.

In the third beat (4) we have a short repeated note that is NOT the first note of the phrase (the first note of the phrase is the note B). The first note of the phrase is the note A, and the second note of the phrase is the note C. The second note of the phrase is a perfect fourth, and this is the note that the composer","Mozart contributed more than 800 pieces of music that are known for melodic beauty, elegance and richness.",0.654798,0.999618,10.74431,0.999859,0.64902,2.809521,-3.8475124835968018

I'm just like, 'How are they not like, the worst people ever in the world?' And then I realized—they are the worst people ever in the world. I was on a ride-along with the police escorting the football players' buses, after a game in Nashville, and the boys were just so nice and respectful and humble and into the girls. And then the girls were just so... The Bachelor. It is just a show designed to put people in a bad mood and make money. I mean, I'm not saying it's bad—I'm just not saying it's good.

""","Skateboarding has been through quite an evolution since its first inception, when it came from the waves to the street. As a sport, skateboarding has always had a special attitude towards rules and pushed boundaries. Think of where one is supposed to skate (in the park) and where the best spots can actually be found across town (particularly where it's forbidden). In contrast to the waves in front of the coast, the asphalt one usually lands on when falling is pretty hard and rough - a circumstance felt by bones and skin. Skateboard riders usually fall quite a bit and despite all, the important thing is to get up and try again, and again, and again. It is just like in life where one grows with their challenges and needs to get up again until the goals are achieved. As humbling and painful as falling onto plain asphalt can be, it can also stimulate resilience and a relieving patience when the goal is in sight.

Here's a video of how to use those tools correctly.

The first step is to remove the safety screws on the bottle so you can lift it off the bottom.

You can see a picture of the underside of the bottle here, and the safety screws are the four black screws on the right side.

You can also see the rivet that is holding the bottle on here.

You can see where the lid is still stuck and you can also see where the rivet is.

Now you can get your fingers under the lip of the lid and just pull it up.

Now you can see the rivet that is stuck in the center of the lid, and the rivet that is still holding the lid in place.

What is the difference between bikepacking and bicycle touring?,"_bikepacking_bicycle_touring_04

During a typical bikepacking trip, I have had the opportunity to bike through some of the most spectacular places on earth. Some places I have been able to bike because of the existing infrastructure, but most of the time I have had to scrounge for a place to stay, and even then, I am often not able to bike the whole way. Bikepacking is an opportunity to take an extended trip, usually a multi-week trip, with a small group of cyclists. At the end of the day, biking is what I do.

What is bikepacking?

bikepacking is the combination of cycling and backpacking. It requires a bike, camping (usually off-season), and a backpack. Most bikers have a tent or two as well.

What is bike touring?

bike touring is a long trip, usually a multi-week trip, in which you bike the whole way. The goal is to get as far as possible in a given timeframe. You usually stay in town-like accommodations.

Why would I do bikepacking?

bikepacking is dangerous. You don’t have the luxury of being able to stop and rest when you need to. You have to make each mile count.

New to bikepacking?

Here are a few things to consider:

bikepacking is for everyone! Everyone should try it.

bikepacking is not about racing. It is about enjoying the journey.

bikepacking is about community. You will ride with more people on a bikepacking trip than you would on a road trip.

bikepacking is about self-sufficiency. You will be on your bike for the majority of the trip.

bikepacking is about being in the moment. You will be in the mountains, among the pine trees, and take in the beauty around you.

bikepacking is about biking. You will be riding your bike, every day.

How do I go about bikepacking?

I have been bikepacking for over 15 years. I have been on over 300 bikepacking trips. These are the things I have learned along the way.

Get a bike. You need a bike to do bikepacking. You will be carrying your own gear and food","The bikepacking movement became popular in the 2010s.

Q:

git - merge two branches without a common ancestor

I have a situation where I'm trying to merge two branches without a common ancestor.
So I have a master branch and a dev branch. I'm trying to merge dev to master without dev having a common ancestor with master.
I tried:
git merge dev

and 
git merge --no-ff dev master

but both of these approaches result in the dev branch having a common ancestor with master.
Any ideas on how I can achieve what I'm trying to do?

A:

You can't merge a master branch into itself. You can merge master into a merge-tracking branch (e.g. dev), but you can't merge dev into master.
You can merge dev into dev, but you can't merge dev into master.

Why is backcountry skiing fun?,".com.au

Backcountry skiing is a great way to get away from it all. Whether you’re looking for a day’s backcountry skiing or heading into the backcountry for an extended stay, we can help you find the right location for your trip.

How do I get the best backcountry skiing?

There is no set formula for backcountry skiing. It’s entirely down to the individual, as everyone has different needs and goals. There are some basic things to consider, though.

The right location for your trip depends on your skills, the area you’re looking to ski and the length of time you’ll be away.

If you’re new to backcountry skiing, you’ll need to build up your skills, as you won’t be comfortable in the wilderness if you haven’t skied for a while. If you’re an advanced skier, you’ll want to choose a trip that’s close to your level of skiing ability.

Your trip will also depend on the weather. If you’re planning a backcountry ski trip for the summer, you’ll want to choose a location that has decent snow and a reasonable chance of being snowed in.

If you’re heading to an alpine region, you’ll want to choose a place that has good snow and is close to a road for transport.

How much does it cost to ski backcountry?

The cost to ski backcountry depends on the location, the length of your trip, the facilities and the number of people.

Skiing backcountry is a great way to get away from it all, but it’s not cheap. You’ll need to budget for accommodation, food and transport. It’s a good idea to take a guide with you to help you pick the right location for your trip.

The price of accommodation will vary from place to place. You can check with the backcountry operator you’re planning to use for a current list of costs, or you can do your own research.

The cost of food will also vary. The more you spend on food, the more you’ll have to spend on accommodation.

If you’re planning to spend a lot of time in the backcountry, you’ll need to be prepared to pay more for accommodation and transport.

Square One

Square One (foaled 1 February 1992) is an Australian Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted from 1995 to 1999 he ran eight times and won two races. In July 1995 he won a race over 2000 metres at Warwick Farm Racecourse and was then exported to Europe where he won the Prix Jean Prat in France. In the following year he was beaten in four of his nine races, including the Group One Matriarch Stakes but he did win the Group Two Glorious Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. He was then retired to stud where he had limited success as a breeding stallion.

Background
Square One was a bay horse with a white blaze bred in New Zealand by his owner Garry Allen. He was sired by the Australian horse Wildfire who won the Derby Stakes in 1982 and the Molecomb Stakes in 1983 before becoming a successful breeding stallion.

Racing career

1995: two-year-old season
Square One made his racecourse debut in a 1400 metre race over 1800 metres at Randwick Racecourse on 8 September and finished fifth of the eight runners behind City Nights. Two weeks later he was moved up in class and distance for the Group One Matriarch Stakes over 2000 metres at Flemington Racecourse and finished second to the French colt Tornado in a race won by the colt's trainer, Steve Tincknell.

So many writers, of course, are wonderful. So many are completely brilliant. The blazing stars of the entire genre are John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway.

They have certainly made people think about their lives, and their worlds, and their characters, and their lives. But they have also done so much more.

Alaska's Oil Production Cut in Half

Back in May, Alaska's oil production, at a record high of 1.7 million barrels per day, was cut in half. At the same time, the harsh winter that Alaska experienced, which included a huge drop in the amount of oil produced, just put Alaskan oil production at 1.2 million barrels per day.

The production cut was due to the fact that oil is hard to reach and refine during the winter months. Alaska's oil production is extremely dependent on the weather, as we have discussed before.

The fact that the cut was only temporary is interesting, and should be of great concern to everyone who is interested in energy prices. In the United States, we have a dependence on oil for heating, and the oil that we import from Alaska comes at a high price.

I'm sure that the media will be all over this story, and I'm sure that the Obama/Lieberman ticket will be making hay in the next couple of months.

The story is a good one for Obama, as it shows him as tough on energy and as a man of action. I'm sure that it will also be an excellent story for Lieberman and for the Democrats.

Of course, it may be a bit too early for such an issue to be a big issue in our elections, but I don't want to be too sure. The more attention this gets, the more likely it is that it will become a major issue in the campaign.

What are the three main states of matter and how does it transition between them?

3 main states of matter

States of matter

There are three main states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. It is the change in the state of matter that allows the matter to move from one state to another. There are different terms and names used to describe the states of matter. However, in this article, the terms used are solid, liquid and gas.

The three main states of matter

Solid

A solid is a form of matter that does not flow and does not change shape. When solid matter is pressed and put into a liquid it will float on top.

Solid state

A solid is a form of matter that does not flow and does not change shape. When solid matter is pressed and put into a liquid it will float on top.

Liquid

A liquid is a form of matter that moves easily and will flow.

Gas

A gas is a form of matter that does not move easily and will not fill up a container. Gas is made of particles which are very small.

Transition between states of matter

The changes between the states of matter are caused by the different energy levels. At the lowest energy level (absolute zero), all the particles are in the same energy level. This will make the particles of the same energy level repel one another.

This will cause the particles to stay in the solid state. However, as the temperature of the system increases, the particles will become more energetic. The particles will gain enough energy to break up the solid and move onto the liquid state.

The change from the solid state to the liquid state is called melting. This is because there is a change in the solid state to a liquid state.

However, at very high temperatures, the particles will gain enough energy to break up the solid and move onto the gas state.

The change from the liquid state to the gas state is called boiling. This is because there is a change in the liquid state to a gas state.

Liquid state to solid state

At very low temperatures, the particles will gain enough energy to break up the liquid and move onto the solid state.

Liquid state to gas state

At very high temperatures, the particles will gain enough energy to break up the liquid and move onto the gas state.

Solid state","The three main states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter consumes energy as it changes state from solid to liquid and liquid to gas. When matter changes from gas to liquid or liquid to solid, it releases energy. Temperature and pressure changes are the key influencers of these state changes.",0.246961,0.998393,25.669089,0.988163,0.165001,5.613521,-7.248704433441162

The invention provides a method for detecting and correcting faults in pipelines as well as the equipment suitable therefor, which can be realized as a system comprising at least two pipelines which are at least partially connected together.
The method according to the invention can be used in particular for detecting and correcting faults in pipelines of the type having a pipeline which is at least partially formed by iron tubes. The pipelines can in particular be pipelines for the transport of fluids, such as oil, gas, water, etc.
In the case of such pipelines, it is possible that, in and along the pipelines, there may be faults, such as coal-bed methane, especially methane containing inclusions, which can cause the pipeline to leak at corroded points.
In the case of pipelines of the type described above, the present invention is distinguished by the fact that the pipeline can be inspected in a non-destructive manner.
An inspection system according to the invention for inspecting pipelines as described above comprises a continuous optical fiber cable which comprises at least one optical fiber and is arranged such that, when the cable is advanced in the pipeline, the optical fiber is scanned with light pulses.
The scanning of the optical fiber is effected such that the light pulses are reflected by the moving cable and detected as a function of the distances between the light pulses and the scanning position. The result of such a scan is a signal which is used for the analysis of the quality of the pipe wall.
The optical fiber may be a single fiber or an array of fibers.
The light pulses may be generated by means of a light emitting diode which is arranged in the cable.

We decided to group the movies together by genre, a wide range of genres, so we could separate movies that were terrible (like “The Last Airbender”) from movies that were simply average (like “The Thing”).

So, without further ado, here are the best movies of 2011.

Best Horror Movies of 2011

“Let the Right One In”

“Let the Right One In” is a very unique movie, and it’s one of the best horror movies of 2011. It is a story about a vampire, and the lengths he will go to in order to find a human to suck his blood. For a movie about a vampire, it’s surprisingly touching and it’s surprisingly well done. It’s a film that has plenty of blood and gore, but it’s definitely one of the more emotional horror movies of the year.

Best Action/Adventure Movies of 2011

“The Dark Knight Rises”

It’s hard to say if “The Dark Knight Rises” is the best movie of 2011, but it’s certainly up there. It’s what every Batman movie should aspire to be: the best movie of 2011. It’s an intense movie, and it’s a movie that has everything you could ask for. It’s a movie that’s not only great to watch, but is also a great movie to talk about afterwards. It’s a movie that will definitely go down in history as one of the best movies of the year.

How is it that some high net-worth individuals are able to avoid paying taxes completely?," a business that is actually owned by the spouse of the owner, how is it that tax evasion is not a criminal offense?

He is right. Tax evasion is not a crime. It's not even a misdemeanor. It's not even a civil violation. It is simply a failure to pay taxes. Only if the IRS can show you have used your money to purchase something you cannot afford to pay for, or to pay for something that violates your religion or is contrary to your political views, are you liable for civil proceedings.

Others have already pointed to the case of the US Supreme Court ruling in the 1960's that the Sixteenth Amendment is not a grant of taxing authority, but merely a statement that Congress has the power to tax incomes. This was, however, just part of a larger argument that the Constitution's ""necessary and proper"" clause gave Congress the power to enact laws that are necessary to execute its other powers. The Court ruled that the power to tax incomes was necessary to fund the Commerce Clause, and that Congress has the power to enact laws necessary for the execution of its other powers.

A long time ago, the Founding Fathers understood the commerce clause. They understood the need to tax imports in order to fund the military. However, the Founding Fathers also understood the need to set up a system of checks and balances that would prevent Congress from becoming too powerful. The Founding Fathers were trying to create a system of government that would allow for a balance between the branches of government. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 10: ""if men were angels, no government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.""

The Constitution is not a grant of taxing authority. The Constitution is a grant of power.

And the power to tax incomes was necessary to fund the military.

The Constitution is a grant of power. The Constitution is a grant of power.

That's right, but the Constitution was written in a time when the technology of tax collection was very limited. It is a codification of pre-existing power. It is not a grant of authority.

The Constitution is not a grant of taxing authority. The Constitution is a grant of power.

In the case of the Sixteenth Amendment, the Court, in","The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes regular income and investment income differently. For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all.",0.037183,0.993018,11.035306,0.866307,0.044681,2.595299,-4.727661609649658

This can be seen in a prism or a rainbow, where sunlight is separated into its component colors. When all these colors are combined, the result is white light.

In terms of pigments, white can be created by using a substance that reflects all colors and absorbs none. This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.

Hi Mandy,
I just discovered your blog and I love it! I love dogs too, and I have a huge soft spot for your old boy dog (who is now a very old boy dog, so I wouldn’t say he’s young). I’m sorry I don’t have a picture of my own dog, but I would love to post one on your blog if you’d let me. I think it would be great to see how he’s changed, and I’d love to see how he’s changed now compared to when you took him home as a puppy. Please let me know if you want to. 🙂

Hope you’re having a great day.

Although the spelling of ""sneaker"" is more common than ""sole,"" the term ""sneaker"" is most often used to refer to fish of the genus Lepomis, while ""sole"" refers to fish of the genus Solea.

Sneakers are a family of small freshwater fishes in the subfamily Lepomisinae. There are about 30 species worldwide. They are found in many habitats, including rivers, lakes, ponds, and ditches. In the United States, they are found in the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, and many small rivers, and they are found as far north as New York. They are small to medium-sized fish. They have black spots on their sides and a light spot on their dorsal fin.

5 Responses to “The Holy Grail of Wines”

I have a feeling that the actual Holy Grail is a myth. After all, I read that the Holy Grail was discovered in the 12th century in France, and that it had something to do with the King’s search for wisdom. I have also read that the first King of France had a wine cellar. Is it possible that the wine cellar and the actual Holy Grail are one and the same?

Hmm, that’s a good point. I don’t know whether the Holy Grail was the wine cellar or the King’s search for wisdom. But I’m sure that the King was quite pleased to discover the wine cellar, because it was likely just what he needed to keep his sanity during the long search for the Holy Grail.In recent years, a digital-to-analog (D/A) converter is employed in a wide variety of electronic equipment and is used for the purpose of audio signal processing. Particularly, a digital-to-analog converter (hereinafter, referred to as “DAC”) is used in the front end section of an audio device since it is one of the most important devices for processing audio signals.
Meanwhile, an audio device is often equipped in a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone. In the mobile terminal, there is a demand for a DAC to be implemented in a limited space.

Please summarize the causes and cure for color blindness given in the passage?,"Please provide the number of the passage with the answer to the question.

Answer(s):

Answer:

Please provide the number of the passage with the answer to the question.

Answer:

The color of a person's skin is determined by the amount of melanin pigment in his skin. People with the same amount of melanin pigment in their skin can have different skin colors. For example, someone with one unit of melanin pigment and someone with nine units can have the same amount of melanin pigment but can have very different skin colors. People with very dark skin can have less melanin pigment than those with very light skin.

Question:

Discuss the impact of color blindness.

Answer:

Color blindness is a genetic condition in which a person has a different color perception than most other people. People with this condition may have difficulty seeing some colors, such as green, red, and violet, or they may have trouble telling the difference between colors. People with this condition may have difficulty seeing some colors, such as green, red, and violet, or they may have trouble telling the difference between colors.

Question:

What are the causes of color blindness?

Answer:

The causes of color blindness are genetic and can range from mild to severe. Some people with color blindness can still see colors and have normal color vision, but they may have difficulty distinguishing colors. In this case, they may have trouble seeing colors as the same color or as different colors. They may have difficulty distinguishing colors.

Why is the SEC the best football conference in America?,"2.jpg

""The SEC is the best football conference in America.""

I agree, but for a different reason.

Some of the best quarterbacks play in the SEC.

Some of the best quarterbacks play in the Pac-10.

And some of the best quarterbacks play in the Big Ten.

I'm not saying the SEC is better than the Pac-10 or Big Ten. In fact, I believe the Pac-10 and Big Ten are the best conferences in America. But I do believe the SEC is the best football conference in America.

Why? Because the SEC and Big Ten play a significantly higher percentage of their games against top-notch opponents than the Pac-10 and Big 12.

Based on the SEC's average win-loss record in conference play this year, we'll see a lot more SEC teams in the BCS top 10 than we would if the SEC played more games against lesser opponents.

The Pac-10 and Big 12 have the same record in conference play as the SEC, but their average win-loss record is 20-46. Alabama, for example, has a better record in conference play than Oregon, which has a better record than Ohio State, which has a better record than Wisconsin, which has a better record than Oklahoma.

The Pac-10 and Big 12 have more good teams than the SEC, but the SEC plays a higher percentage of its games against good teams.

Some of the best teams in America play in the SEC.

And some of the best teams in America play in the Pac-10.

Some of the best teams in America play in the Big Ten.

And some of the best teams in America play in the Big 12.

The best teams in America play in the BCS top 10.

The SEC is the best football conference in America.

The SEC is the best football conference in America.

You're not going to get any argument from me about that.

You can't argue with the SEC's record in league play, which is a record of 16-6. But I think the SEC is second in the country in terms of the percentage of its average games played against top-level opponents.

I also don't think the SEC is the best football conference in America in terms of winning the national championship. I think it's the best conference in terms of having the most teams in the BCS top",The SEC is the best conference for several reasons. The National champion has come from the SEC 13 times since 2006.

Word order is all about determining the function of words and phrases and how they relate to one another.

Here are some examples of word order:

The first one is a sentence. The second is a phrase. The third is a clause. The last one is a sentence.

Learn to spot the differences between the three.

Here’s what you need to know.

(1) Sentence Structure: Sentences

A sentence is a complete thought. Sentences can be simple sentences, compound sentences, or complex sentences.

(2) Compound Sentences:

A compound sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses. Each clause in a compound sentence must have a subject and a verb.

In the sentence, “The man cut his finger,” the two independent clauses are the subject and the verb.

So, we can see that there are two independent clauses in the sentence.

(3) Complex Sentences:

A complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses. Each clause in a compound sentence must have a subject and a verb.

In the sentence, “The man cut his finger,” the two independent clauses are the subject and the verb.

So, we can see that there are two independent clauses in the sentence.

(4) Clauses:

A clause is a group of words that expresses a complete thought. Clauses are made up of a subject and a verb.

In the sentence, “The man cut his finger,” the two clauses are the subject and the verb.

So, we can see that there are two clauses in the sentence.

(5) Simple Sentences:

A simple sentence is a sentence that contains only one independent clause.

In the sentence, “The man cut his finger,” the independent clause is the subject.

So, we can see that there is only one independent clause in the sentence.

Player of the Order of Canada, Order of Ontario

James Pressdee was the first Canadian to win a World Cup, but he was also the first Canadian to lose a World Cup. In 1961, Pressdee, a member of the Canadian Alpine Ski Team, won the overall World Cup title in the giant slalom, becoming the first Canadian to do so. He also won the silver medal in the slalom and placed third in the combined.

Pressdee’s first World Cup win came at the age of 20 in 1960, and he became the youngest to win a World Cup overall title later that year. He won two more World Cup overall titles in 1961 and 1962, the first Canadians to do so. He was also the first Canadian to win a gold medal in one World Cup event – the giant slalom. He finished fourth in the giant slalom at the 1961 World Championships in Kitzbuehel, Austria and became the first Canadian to do so.

Pressdee won the overall World Cup title in the giant slalom in 1961 and 1962, becoming the first Canadian to do so.

Pressdee was born in Victoria, British Columbia, on April 2, 1943. He was a member of the Canadian Ski Team from 1960 to 1971. In 1967, Pressdee won the gold medal in the downhill at the World Championships in Grenoble, France. He was also the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in alpine skiing, winning a bronze medal in the downhill at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. Pressdee was also a member of the Canadian Olympic team in 1964. He also won a silver medal in the slalom in 1964.

Pressdee died on November 26, 2014, at the age of 71.

"Given this paragraph on LeBron James' early career, when did he win his first NBA MVP?","iveThe quick answer is not soon enough. He won it in 2015, a year in which he led the league in scoring. But LeBron's first MVP was one of the most controversial in NBA history.

He still doesn't have it. He's not a lock for the award, despite leading the league in scoring for the sixth consecutive season. He's a three-time Finals MVP, true, but he's not a lock for an MVP award.

Why the MVP award is so hard to win

This is in large part because the MVP award is an imperfect award. It is weighted toward the most valuable player on a team, but that doesn't mean it is the best player. It doesn't even necessarily mean it is the most valuable player on the best team. There are a lot of factors that go into an MVP award, and determining who the most valuable player is is not necessarily easy.

MLB.com's Gary Sánchez wrote a piece after the 2015 NBA Finals that explained this. The popular narrative is that LeBron James is the MVP, and that's not necessarily true.

""LeBron James has the hardware, but he's not the MVP,"" Sánchez wrote. ""He's the guy who took the 'best player on the best team' award to a whole new level. But he should not be the MVP.""

Sánchez's point is that James isn't the most valuable player on the best team. The Cavaliers have won the NBA title in the past two seasons. They have the best record in the league this season. James has been a terrific player, but he's not the most valuable player on the team.

James has made the MVP award his goal since the end of the 2016 season. He has made the Finals four consecutive years, but it's hard to say he is the most valuable player on any of those teams.

James is the most valuable player on the Cavaliers, but the Cavs were the best team in the NBA this year.

How do you make Crawfish bread?,"

A:

For a single shrimp, I'd remove the head and back and leave the tail intact.

Plunge the shrimp head-first into boiling water for a minute or two. 
Remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and rinse with cold water.
Using a knife, remove the shell and the vein with the black dot.
Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off the head and the tail and discard.

For a crawfish, I'd do the same, just cutting the head at an angle, rather than straight down.

I'd consider it necessary to get a crawfish that weighs at least 5-6 pounds.

A:

I don't understand why people do this...

You cut the head off the shrimp:

Remove the head from the shrimp (cut the back off completely).
Remove the black dot from the tail by cutting it straight down.
Cut the tail off the shrimp (cut the tail straight down).

You can remove the claws at the ends of the legs by cutting them off at a 45° angle:

Cut the claw with the black dot off at a 45° angle.

The rest of the steps are the same as for a crawfish:

Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut off the head.

You can also remove the ""red flesh"" at the tail by cutting along the back, just like the recipe says.

I am new to ruby on rails. I am going to create a simple app on which the user will be able to add,delete,update and view the records. I have created the model, a controller, a view and a model as well. The model is as follows:
class Record
  include ActiveModel::Validations
  attr_accessor :name, :email, :address, :password, :phone, :email_address, :mob, :home_page_url, :status, :company

  def validate
    if not valid_email?

1/4 cup grated Parmesan
1/2 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 loaf French bread

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
2. Rinse the crawfish. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, Cajun seasoning and crawfish. Saute for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. 
3. In a bowl, mix together the cheeses, mayonnaise and parsley. Add the tomato and crawfish mixture to the mayo mixture. 
4. Cut the loaf of bread in half and then cut the bread lengthwise. Spoon the mixture on the bread and bake for 10 to 15 minutes. Then broil for an additional 3 to 5 minutes. Watch closely, as not to burn.

How well establish is the Cuban red-tailed hawk as a species?," and It was a little unsettling to think that those words were coming from someone who had been intimately involved with the species for the past few years.

The hawk was taken by my friend on the morning of the 20th. It was not easy to bag the bird, as the hawk was aware of the human presence and kept trying to get away, but eventually my friend and I got it. It was the second time I’d seen the bird, as it was the same bird I’d seen in a few months prior.

I can only speculate as to the hawk’s fate. I am certain that the hawk, like the others, was brought to the United States and then released somewhere in the Florida Keys. In the past few months, I have heard reports of hawks sighted in the Florida Keys, but none had been confirmed. I hope the hawk made it back to its native range in Cuba and simply decided to stay in the Florida Keys for the winter.

The Cuban red-tailed hawk is an interesting bird and I’m glad I got to see it. Although I have no idea what happened to it, I hope it made it back to its native range in Cuba for the winter.

The Avian Rescue and Rehabilitation Center (ARRC) in Naples, Florida, has been busy all year, welcoming many birds of prey.

I had the opportunity to visit the ARRC twice this year. My first visit was in June when I brought in a Great horned owl that had been struck by a car. The owl was in critical condition and had to be put on an IV and given fluids. I was able to collect blood samples, but the owl was not eating well and had lost a lot of weight.

I was able to visit again in October when I brought in a tufted titmouse that had been struck by a car. This time, the bird was in much better condition and was eating and drinking.

The ARRC is a great place to visit and is a great resource for bird rescue. I encourage anyone in the Naples, Florida area who finds a bird (or any animal) to contact the ARRC. You can visit the ARRC website at www.naplesbirds.com

"Given this paragraph about kubernetes, what is the storage layer of Kubernetes control plane?","/storage is the thing that is responsible for managing the persistent volume volumes. The storage layer is responsible for creating and managing persistent volume volumes for the control plane.

So does that mean that you could use some of the best practices of managing persistent volumes for the control plane (like the one described in this article) for the data plane too?

Yeah, in fact, the PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims are the only two types of volumes you will ever use. But it's worth noting that they are very different in behavior. PersistentVolumes are for storing data, and PersistentVolumeClaims are for creating and managing persistent volumes.

Yea! Thanks a lot. Could you please elaborate on the concept of volume mount? How do I create a volume mount on my pod?

A volume mount is a way to mount a volume into your container. You can think of it like a folder in Finder, except instead of writing to the file system, you are writing to a separate block storage layer. You can think of it as a piece of the host's file system that is only visible to the container.

You can use the volume mount to access the volume that was mounted, or you can use it to mount a directory inside the volume that contains files or data.

How do I mount a directory inside the volume that contains files or data?

When you mount a volume, Kubernetes creates a subdirectory inside the volume that contains the actual files that were stored on the volume. So, for example, if you have a volume named ""myvolume"" that was created with the path ""/mnt/myvolume"", then you can mount the directory ""/mnt/myvolume/data"" into your container by running:

$ kubectl run ndc --image=nginx --volume=myvolume --mount type=bind,source=data,target=/data,readOnly=true

What does the _hostNetwork field do?

When you create a kubernetes pod, the value of the _hostNetwork field determines whether the pod will be able to access the host network.

The _hostNetwork field is a boolean flag that determines whether a pod can access the host network. If true, then the pod can access the host network; if false, then the pod cannot access the host network.

If you set _hostNetwork=false, then the pod can access the host network; if false",ETCD,0.826141,0.999274,17.099874,0.992556,0.851323,4.153834,-6.286894798278809

You are going to get some great advice here.

I've been in the same spot as you. I had been using my iPhone for years, but
ended up with a Nexus 5. It's fantastic. I can't recommend it highly enough.

If you want to get back to the iPhone, I'd recommend that you do the normal
things people do when they switch devices:

1\. Set up a mail account on your new phone.

2\. Drop all of your other email accounts and social media accounts. You'll
find that you'll be using your new device primarily for checking your email,
so you can then use Google's excellent Inbox app to manage all of your
messages.

3\. Switch your main phone number to your new one.

4\. Set up Chrome/Firefox/Chromium on the new device.

5\. Use whatever online banking services you have on the old phone.

6\. Set up whatever online payments you use on the old device.

7\. Download all your apps for the new device.

8\. Set up your Gmail inboxes to sync the two devices.

9\. Set up all your calendar events on the new phone.

10\. Set up all your contacts on the new phone.

11\. Enable two-factor authentication on the new device.

12\. Set up every password you need on the new device.

13\. Set up your new phone to automatically backup to Google Drive.

14\. Enable an additional Google account on the new device, and sign into
that.

Once you have all that configured, I'd drop the old device and wait for the
new one to arrive. You will then have a nice clean slate to begin again.

Well, I've been in this exact same situation. I had an iPhone 4S, and I loved
it. I never really got into the OS, and I quickly realized that the lack of
RAM was a huge issue. I purchased a Nexus 5 and I can't recommend it enough.
It's smooth, fast, and the battery life is excellent. I was never really a
fan of Android in the first place, but the Nexus 5 took it to the next level.

What are the unofficial forms of written Norwegian?,"?

I am a native speaker of Norwegian and I speak it everyday. I wanted to know the unofficial forms of written Norwegian. I mean what are the equivalent forms of Norwegian written in English or German?

A:

I'm not sure if there are any 'unofficial' forms in English, but you can use the 'simple past' form, as suggested by @Migration2000. The same goes for German, but I don't have any examples for that.

A:

As @Migration2000 mentioned, the simple past is the most common way to write Norwegian.
The official translations of the Norwegian language into other languages is through a specific process called ""Norwegianisation"" (or ""Norwegianisation"" in English), and this process is unique for each language. The process is based on changing grammatical and syntactical rules from Norwegian to the language it is being translated into.
In case of Norwegian, this process is called ""Norwegianisation"", and it is done by the Norwegian Government.
You can read more about Norwegianisation of English, here.
In the case of German, this process is called Deutschsprachigen Übersetzung, and is done by the German Government. You can find more detailed information on the process of Germanisation, here.

A:

The official forms of Norwegian are the standardized written forms in the language, and the written forms are always in the third person plural (persons).
If your Norwegian is good enough, you may use the full plural form, but it is not common.
The equivalent forms in the other languages are also standardized, but they are not necessarily in the third person plural. In English, it is often the first person plural (people). In German, it is often the second person plural (den, die, das, etc.)

What is the key to longevity?,".

How to lose belly fat The great thing about green tea is that it really does seem to help you lose belly fat. When it comes to green tea, it’s important to understand how it works to lose belly fat. Green tea is a type of tea that is made from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant.

Green tea has been called the ""the world's most popular beverage"",[6] and is the most widely consumed type of tea in the world. It is brewed from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, which are processed to remove the chlorophyll, and the caffeine content is significantly lower than in black tea.

Green tea is also known for its health benefits. Green tea has been shown to have antioxidant properties, and prevent cancer. The polyphenol antioxidants, catechins, are also found in plant foods such as green tea.

Green tea also has a lot of health benefits. It has been shown to lower the risk of stroke, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, and help prevent certain types of cancer. Green tea also has anti-aging properties, and may be helpful for people with wrinkles, and dry skin.

Consuming green tea is slightly better than drinking water to lose belly fat. In a study of overweight men and women, researchers found that those who drank about 2 cups a day for a period of 12 weeks lost about 3 pounds in the first three months, and about 7 pounds during the entire 12 weeks.

Green tea is loaded with antioxidants, which are substances in food that help protect you from disease. Scientists believe that antioxidants can help prevent cancer by fighting the free radicals that can damage cells.

The antioxidants may also protect against heart disease by reducing the damage caused by free radicals in the blood vessels. To get the full benefit of antioxidants, eat a variety of antioxidant-rich foods. Antioxidants are found in many fruits and vegetables, especially berries and dark-green leafy vegetables.

Your body makes its own antioxidants to protect it against the damage caused by free radicals. However, if you don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables, your body may not be able to make the antioxidants it needs.

There is evidence that green tea may protect against some types of cancer, and help prevent other types of cancer. There is not enough evidence to suggest that green tea is helpful for preventing heart disease or stroke, however, so it does not make a good substitute for medications.
","Researchers and doctors have been studying this for many years and a number of patterns has consistently shown to be true: It's a combination of nutrition, exercise and sleep. From a nutrition perspective, a predominantly plant-based diet is the way to go. The Mediterranean diet continues to outperform all other diets year after year. A plant-based diet can not only prevent disease but it can reverse cardiovascular illness and many others. We now also have enough evidence on the importance of movement, exercise and specifically a combination of resistance and endurance training. Muscle growth is not only positive for the muscles themselves but it also positively affects bone density (which we tend to lose as we age), as well as effects on your immune system, gut microbiome and even mental health. The positives are endless. Lastly, if we do not get proper sleep (typically 7-9hours/night), the other two factors, diet and exercise, will not be optimal. Consistency in going to sleep and waking up at the same time is crucial to overall wellbeing and recovery. 
Researchers of the Blue Zones argue that another crucial part to living healthily into old age is the social circle or community we are part of.

The city of Denton, Texas is in the midst of a budget crisis. The school district has laid off multiple teachers and that's not stopping. The school board is considering the reopening of the school book depository for the sole use of the district's custodial staff.

The school board has called for a teachers meeting to discuss the matter on Monday.

Superintendent Dr. Jeff King announced before the school board meeting that the book depository has to be closed.

""The goal is to use the school book depository to get it back up and running as soon as possible,"" King said.

King also confirmed that the school board will meet on Monday to discuss the book depository.

""I believe we will be meeting Monday to discuss the book depository,"" King said.

State Rep. Rob Eissler, R-The Colony, has proposed legislation that would help the school board. Eissler said he's not sure how much money the school district would need to reopen the book depository. The city of Denton has started a GoFundMe page to help the school district.

The school board will be holding a special meeting on Monday to talk about the book depository.

The school board is also expected to hold a special meeting regarding the layoff of the custodial staff. The school district laid off nine custodial staff members since the beginning of the academic year.

""Prior to the last meeting, I had an opportunity to meet one-on-one with the custodial staff in an effort to get some of the more specific details,"" King said. ""I am going to be meeting with the custodial staff this afternoon to discuss the layoff.""

The school board will also be discussing the on-going budget for the school district.

The school board is expected to use the special meeting for both discussion about the layoff of custodial staff and the budget.

The school board will also be discussing a new bond issue that would fund the construction of a new school building as well as the remodeling of three other school buildings.

Superintendent Dr. Jeff King said the school board is not in favor of the bond issue.

""I think a bond of this magnitude to just renovate three buildings is a bit of a stretch,"" King said.

The school district is looking at several options for the new school building.

Extract from the text who invented the Optophone.,", 2, 4, 6 and 8, respectively, are the color-reversal frequencies of the three primary colors, red, green and blue, and are commonly known as RGB colors. All the colors that can be made with these three colors have frequencies between 0 and 255, which are the levels that the computer monitor can display. The amount of light that a particular color absorbs in order to appear black is expressed in terms of its tint. For example, a color with a frequency of 65,536 (which is the maximum frequency that a standard monitor can display) is a pure black, while a color with a frequency of 256 (which is half the maximum frequency a standard monitor can display) is a pure white.

The RGB frequencies can be used to make each of the more than 16 million colors that a standard computer monitor can display. For example, the color red is made by using the RGB frequencies of 255, 0, 0 and is the color of the light that is reflected from a red blood cell. The same red color can be made by using combinations of the RGB frequencies of 65,536, 0, 0, 0 and 65,536, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 and 65,536, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

The RGB frequencies can also be used to make the colors and shades of gray that can be found in the shadows and highlights of an object or scene on a computer monitor. For example, the color white is made by using the RGB frequencies of 255, 0, 0 and is the color of the light that is reflected from a white piece of paper, while the shade of gray that is reflected by a white piece of paper is made using the RGB frequencies of 0, 0, 0 and 255.

The RGB frequencies are also used to make the colors and shades of gray that represent the various parts of a graphic image on a computer monitor. For example, the color white is made by using the RGB frequencies of 255, 0, 0 and is the color of the light that is reflected from a white piece of paper, while the shade of gray that is reflected by a white piece of paper is made using the RGB frequencies of 0, 0, 0",Dr. Edmund Fournier d'Albe,0.666445,0.985934,0.088542,0.995791,0.81758,0.710859,-3.7215967178344727
"Tell me whether these animals are a canine or a feline: French Bulldog, Siamese Cat, Sharpei"," Cat, Persian Cat.

Answers:

And an answer for the second part of the question, ""What is the difference between a Siamese cat and a Persian cat?""

The answer is that we can't tell because they look so much alike, they are so similar in appearance.

Now, you have to realize when you're going to take the test that you have to be able to tell the difference between these two animals.

So, if you're going to try to make it through the test, you've got to realize and understand that it's going to be very difficult, because these two animals are so similar, and they look so much alike.

So, you've got to know that you're going to have to try to tell the difference between the two of them.

So, the first thing is to get that little two-dimensional piece of paper, which is a 8.5"" x 11"" piece of paper, and put the animal on top of it.

The second thing is that you've got to try to tell the difference between the two of them.

So, you can't use the color.

You can't use the size.

You can't use the shape.

You've got to try to tell the difference between these two animals.

And the way you can do that is to try to match them up, to try to match up the feet and the ears and the head, and try to match up the tail, and try to match up the body, so that the body is more or less the same when you see one as opposed to the other.

And then you've got to try to match up the nose, and the eyes, and the ears.

And you've got to try to match up the whiskers, and the fur on top of the head, and the color of the fur.

And then you've just got to try to remember the shape of the body, the size, and the color.

The two-dimensional piece of paper is called a ""shape card.""

So, you're going to have to try to remember these things.

And so if you're trying to take the test, it's very difficult.

And it's very difficult to take the test.

But if you, it's very difficult to take the test.

It's very difficult to take the test.","The french bulldog is a canine, the Siamese Cat is a feline and the Sharpei is a canine.",0.065491,0.998668,13.536978,0.996081,0.076586,3.134761,-5.087164878845215
Why is film photography popular again?,"art

Throughout history, photography has been used to document and create memories.

"From the text provided, give me a summary of the most popular attractions in Yosemite National Park.","its answer

Yosemite National Park is located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in eastern California. The park covers roughly 5,000 square miles of wilderness and is comprised of several easily accessible areas. The most popular area of the park is the Yosemite Valley, which is the center of the valley floor. Other popular areas include the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia trees, the Yosemite Falls, and the Wawona Tunnel.

The Yosemite Valley is the main destination of Yosemite National Park. The valley contains many different types of trees, including the most famous, the giant sequoias. The valley is also home to a variety of animals, including many deer. The valley is home to the famous Yosemite Falls, which is the largest waterfall in the world. The falls are very impressive, and they can be seen from many different places around the valley.

The Mariposa Grove is home to the largest grove of Giant Sequoia trees in the world. The grove is located in the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoia National Monument, part of the park. The grove contains many different types of trees and is a popular stop for visitors to the park. The grove is also home to a variety of animals, including many deer.

The Wawona Tunnel is one of the largest tunnels in the world. The tunnel is located on the western side of the park. The tunnel was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1938 and 1940. The tunnel was originally used to carry park visitors in a funicular, a type of cable car. In 1955, the tunnel was converted into a vehicle tunnel. The tunnel was extensively damaged by fire in 1967, but it was repaired by 1984.

Lee's Ferry is located in the park. The ferry is the only public ferry in the park. The ferry carries passengers across the Merced River. The ferry takes about 15 minutes to cross the Merced river. The ferry is also located near the Wawona Tunnel, which can be accessed by foot, bicycle, or car.

Ahwahnee Hotel is the most famous hotel in Yosemite. The hotel was a favorite of John Muir, who wrote about his experience in the hotel in his book The Yosemite.

He didn't say why he wanted to sell it or how much he wanted for it. I drove it home and took it for a test drive. It was a very smooth ride. I got it in the shop and they said it was a good car. I paid $420 for it. I hope it works out well for me.

Give me a list of the best bikes for riding on roads.,"es.

matt

I have just acquired a 29er from a friend who is moving to the uk for work. I am looking to buy a road bike. The problem I have is getting the best road bike for my weight and budget. I am 185lbs and have had a lot of fun on my 26 inch MTB but I am looking to go for a bit more speed. I dont want to go down to a smaller bike. I have been looking at some 29ers and I am just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on what bike would be good for my weight and speed?

I think the 29er would be a good choice. If you can afford it, a used steel 'cross bike would be a good choice as it would be lighter and cheaper. I would say the best way to go would be to get a bike that is in your weight range.

I'm 6'2"" and ride a cross bike as my main commuter. I also ride the road with my wife (I'm a little shorter than her) and have a steel 'cross bike for that.

If you are tall and want to go faster, consider a smaller bike. I'm not tall, but I wanted to go faster than my bike at that time. I have average height and ride a 20 inch bike.

If you are only going to ride the road with your wife, then get a smaller bike. The smallest bikes are the most expensive.

matt

Thanks for the replies. I dont think I am tall enough to ride a cross bike. I am currently looking at a Cannondale CAAD9 and a Cannondale CAAD10. I am looking for a bike that is comfortable for long distances and would be good for a commute as well. I am also looking at a used steel 'cross bike that is about the same price as the Cannondale bikes.

I am 6'1"", about 180lbs and have ridden mostly MTB for the past 5 years, with a few road bikes thrown in for good measure. I am looking for a bike I can ride all day, ride on the road and also ride on the trails. I think the 29er would be a good choice, however I am not sure if I am physically capable of the handling of a 29er. I am also not sure if I would be comfortable on a bike that is a big difference in size from what I am currently riding.

"Tell me whether these states are in Eastern Time, Central Time, or neither",".

A:

The easiest way is to add the following to your code:
from time import gmtime, localtime

# ...

# for Eastern Time
if time_of_day == 'ET':
    time_of_day = timezone.localize(gmtime(time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"")))

# for Central Time
elif time_of_day == 'CT':
    time_of_day = timezone.localize(time.localtime(time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"")))

# for neither
else:
    time_of_day = timezone.localize(time.localtime(time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"")))

This will set the time_of_day variable to the current time for Eastern Time, Central Time, or for the 'Neither' time.
For example, if the time_of_day variable was set to ""10:30"", and the time of day was ""11:30"" (both in Eastern Time):
time_of_day = ""11:30""
time_of_day = timezone.localize(time.localtime(time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"")))
print(time_of_day)
print(time.localtime(time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"")))

The output is:
11:30 AM
11:30 AM

A:

time.strptime() returns a tuple (hour, minute, second).
The strptime() function always returns a tuple, and the timezone module only converts the value of the second component into a timezone object. So, if you want to get the timezone object, you have to convert the tuple into a string:
time_of_day = time.strptime(time_of_day, ""%I:%M %p"").zone
time_of_day = time_of_day.tzname

What are some examples of CPU architectures that do not use a dedicated flag register?,"1-e.com has great information on this.

A:

The flag register is not common in RISC architectures like ARM.  The flag register is useful for certain types of instruction and in certain situations.  It is not a ""must have"" in any general sense.  Other instruction types are not modified by the flag register in most of the RISC architectures.  (For example, the PUSH/POP are always independent of the flag register.)

A:

The flag register is useful for certain types of instructions.  If the instruction is an illegal instruction, the flag register is set to indicate this (if used), and the instruction is ignored (not executed).
If the instruction is data dependent, it is useful to be able to specify the operation to execute when the instruction is executed.  For example, one might want to increment a register twice in a loop.  If the instruction is data dependent, it is possible to specify that the instruction is executed twice.  If the instruction is not data dependent, it is possible to specify that the instruction is executed once.  But in some cases, it is useful to be able to specify both.
If the instruction is load-store instruction, it is useful to be able to specify that the instruction is executed if the memory is not yet available, or is written to after the instruction is executed.  If the instruction is not load-store instruction, it is useful to be able to specify that the instruction is executed when the memory is available.  
If the instruction is conditional branch, it is useful to be able to specify that the instruction is executed only if the condition is true.  If the instruction is not conditional branch, it is useful to be able to specify that the instruction is executed only if the condition is false.
If the instruction is a memory reference, it is useful to be able to specify whether the memory is accessed using the A register, X register, or Y register.
If the instruction is not a memory reference, it is useful to be able to specify the addressing mode.

A:

The flag register is useful for certain types of instructions, such as Load-Store.  Other types of instructions do not use the flag register.

How many plastic beads does it take to fill a ceramic duck?," to be able to elevate his game (we think) and make it a two-team race in the Western Conference standings. A huge trade later in the season could make things even more interesting.

After a rocky start to the year, and some push back from the coaching staff, the Kings found themselves in a rut. With their newfound chemistry and the return of Drew Doughty to the lineup, the Kings have found their footing. On Thursday night, they’ll have an opportunity to put all of the pieces together and take a crucial two points in the standings, as they go into Colorado to take on a Rockies team that has a lot of problems of its own.

The Kings won’t get points for having a great defensive game. They’ll get points for having a great offensive game.

The Kings are 11th in scoring in the NHL — ahead of only the Chicago Blackhawks, Buffalo Sabres, and Toronto Maple Leafs — and their top three scorers are all on pace to have career years.

Derek Forbort is doing what he does, scoring goals. Anze Kopitar is doing what he does, scoring goals. Dustin Brown is doing what he does, scoring goals. Ryan Smyth is doing what he does, scoring goals.

It’s a good thing the Kings are so good at scoring goals, because they’re not really good at anything else.

The Kings are 12th in goals against per game in the NHL. They’re in the bottom third of the league in points allowed per game, with a 31.6-point-per-game average.

They’re also dead last in penalty killing, at an abysmal 79.3 percent mark.

Sure, they’re still first in the Pacific Division, but they’re not making any noise in the Western Conference.

It’s not just the offense that’s struggling. The Kings are also 11th in the league in the power-play department.

The Kings have not scored a power-play goal in their last five games. On Thursday night, they’ll face a power-play unit that is 0-for-4 in their last two games.

And for good reason.

The Kings’ power-play unit is ranked 28th in the NHL, and there’s a reason for that. They’re 0-for-13 on the man","This is dependent on factors such as the size of the plastic beads, the size and shape of the duck and its hollowness, and what is considered ""full"".",0.414391,0.969943,0.027332,0.906862,0.485636,0.560833,-5.187145709991455

Teacher Tip: If you have a student who is having difficulty distinguishing between woodwind and string instruments you may try an exercise like this:

Students can be given a list of instruments and asked to identify which one(s) are woodwind and which are string. You can also create a listening activity in which students listen to a recording of the instruments along with the description.

Teacher Tip: If you are working with a student who is having trouble with the concept of the different modes of the piano (for example, a student may not know that a chord can be played in two different ways on the piano), you can have the student play the chords in the three different modes of the piano. This can be done in the following ways:

First play all the chords in the piano in the “Natural” mode. Then play the chords in the “Sharp” mode. Finally play the chords in the “Flat” mode.

You can also make use of the “Flat” mode by playing the same recorded piece of music in the piano in the “Natural”, “Sharp”, and “Flat” modes.

As you play the chords in the different modes of the piano, your student should be able to identify which mode(s) are being used.

Can I contact a lawyer and have the complaint filed without the officer?

Have you filed a complaint? If not I would suggest that you do so. I know that the Police are not to be taken lightly, but the fact is that you need to go to the police with a complaint and they need to investigate it.

You will need to contact the Police department informing them that you have a complaint against them as well as the other officers. You will need to be able to give a full account of the events that led to your arrest and a statement of what you want. If you have a lawyer, they will be able to help you with this process as well.

###### PINP levels by *GDF15* rs14338319 genotypes in European ancestry individuals","In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to",0.849456,0.997822,9.642657,0.999202,0.856292,2.669086,-12.030502319335938

Why did the Sahara experience a period of rapid desertification?,".org/article/faith/sahara.html

Sahara Sands, a powerful civilization that flourished in the Sahara, lasted for thousands of years. Sahara Sands was the largest and most powerful civilization in the region. Despite being relatively advanced for its time, Sahara Sands was ultimately overcome by the neighboring Aksumites, a group of people who incorporated the Sahara Sands culture and language into their own. The Sahara Sands culture was a combination of several cultures, and the combined culture of Sahara Sands influenced the culture of both present-day Egypt and Libya.

The Sahara Sands culture was highly advanced for its time, and it was very sophisticated in its architectural style. The Sahara Sands people built a large number of pyramids and tombs in the area. The pyramids and tombs of Sahara Sands are some of the largest in Africa and in the world. The pyramids and tombs were constructed using many different techniques and materials. The pyramids and tombs of Sahara Sands were constructed in a way that allowed the entire structure to be moved on wheels. The pyramids and tombs of Sahara Sands were also built using concrete. The Sahara Sands pyramids and tombs were built to last for thousands of years.

One of the most important aspects of Sahara Sands culture was agriculture. The Sahara Sands people were able to grow a variety of crops, including grains, vegetables, fruits, and cattle. The Sahara Sands people were able to irrigate their fields using water from the river Nile. The Sahara Sands people had a system of canals that allowed them to grow crops using irrigation. The Sahara Sands people were able to produce a variety of goods and they were able to produce a surplus of food.

The Sahara Sands people were a society that was very advanced, and their culture was incorporated into Egypt and Libya. The Sahara Sands culture was able to influence the culture of both present-day Egypt and Libya. The culture of Sahara Sands was eventually assimilated into the culture of both present-day Egypt and Libya. The Sahara Sands were eventually absorbed into the culture of Egypt. The people of Egypt were able to absorb the culture of Sahara Sands into their culture. The culture of Egypt was later absorbed into the culture of Libya.

Can any piece promote to a queen?,", a castle, a pawn, a queen, a knight, or a bishop?

I’m really excited about the next two books in the series. A book that is going to continue the story of the Gray Lords. A book that will be about the new queen of the Gray Lords. She is coming from a different place than the others. A daughter of the Gray Lords. But she is not all that she appears to be.

The first book has a very unique heroine…she is a thief. A trained thief. A thief who can steal a city.

“I’m here to steal your city, dragon slayer.I’m here to steal your city.”

And she is coming to steal it for her queen. I hope you’ll enjoy the series.

Now, I’ve already told you what the book is about. But I don’t want to leave you without knowing what it’s about. So here it is:

It is a story about the females of the Gray Lords. How they are faring in the world of the Gray Lords. How they are struggling to survive. How they are struggling to find a place to belong.

Each book is going to have a different focus. A different story. A different idea. They are going to show the struggle of the females of the Gray Lords. And I hope that you enjoy the story.

A:

The following list gives you an idea of the kinds of things you need to know.

Not all costly things are expensive.
There are two kinds of goods: expendable goods (e.g. air, gold) and non-expendable goods (e.g. rock, rocket, dream).
Expensive things can be cheap.
Expensive things can be cheap because they can be replaced by cheaper things.
Expensive things are not expensive because they can be replaced by cheaper things.

The second type is the key to the answer. It is obvious that rock, rocket and dream. are not expensive because it is possible to replace them with cheaper things. But rocket, rock and dream. are also not expensive because air and gold can be replaced by them.
You can also come up with some interesting examples of expensive and non-expensive things (for example, names of countries).

Q:

How to make a service that can be used from an Android application

I would like to create a service in my Android application, that can work independent of the main application. For example, the service could be used to write data to a file, or something, but I would like it to be independent of the application, so that I could call it from another application. 
So, I would like to have a service that could be called from an application, or even from another application. But I would like it to run independently. 
Is there a way to do this?
I am using Java for the service.

A:

You can also use the LocalBroadcastManager class.
This is the code for the service to broadcast data:
private class SampleReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        Log.d(TAG, ""broadcast received"");
    }
}

And this is the code to start the service:
LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).registerReceiver(
                    new SampleReceiver(), new IntentFilter(""BROADCAST_ACTION""));

I have no problem with the idea. I’m sure it’s controversial enough to get some people fired up. But I think it’s a more interesting question to ask why people are so passionate about some of our leaders, rather than which ones.

What is the difference between a ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ Ghost?

What is the difference between a ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ Ghost?

There are a lot of different types of ghosts and spirits out there. They are not all the same. Depending on how they came about and the circumstances of the person who died they might be good or bad, but a lot of them are just out for revenge.

We all know there are bad spirits out there, but what is a ‘good’ ghost? And what makes the difference between a ‘bad’ and a ‘good’ one?

There are different types of spirits and ghosts. Most of the time they are out for revenge and so they will do whatever they can to hurt the living. They might do this by trying to scare or haunt the living, calling to them from the shadows or even trying to hurt them in other ways.

The good type of ghost is actually seeking to make contact with the living and have a good relationship with them. They do this by appearing to the living in a manner they can see and hear them, they can also communicate with the living. This type of ghost is not out for revenge, but they are still out there, seeking to help and protect the living.

There is a difference between a ‘bad’ and a ‘good’ ghost and this is based on their attitude. They are still out there, seeking to harm, scare and hurt the living, but they have a different attitude, one that is more ‘giving’ rather than ‘winning’ and so they are more likely to seek protection rather than attack.

When they are seeking to help and protect the living they tend to do so in a manner that is not out to make themselves known to the living. They might not be able to touch the living, but they can still project themselves into their homes and give them a warning to stay away from the house or to protect themselves.

They might not appear to the living at that moment, but they might come back to visit them or send them a message. They are still out there, seeking to harm, scare and hurt the living, but they are more likely to do this in a way that is more subtle than direct.",Gmail,0.218094,0.998164,4.705642,0.97026,0.213037,1.421039,-4.400020599365234

To lose weight, one needs to create a build a mental model that they can follow. For example, one pound of fat has 3500 calories, one needs to reduce the diet by that much to lose a pound of weight.

Who is Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke named after?,": Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke named after:
Duke University, a major research institution in Durham, North Carolina, has named its new school of public policy after former U.S. Representative Sanford Bishop (D-NC).

The school's name was announced June 11, 2013, in a ceremony at the Duke University Chapel.

Bishop, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1953 to 1959, was a champion of civil rights and economic fairness for African-Americans.

He was also a member of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee, and was a member of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Bishop was also a leader of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and helped to organize the 1956 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He was also a sponsor of legislation to extend voting rights to African-Americans.

Bishop resigned from Congress in 1959 to become general counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1960 by President John F. Kennedy. In 1963, he became the first African-American to be elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.

Upon his election to the U.S. House in 1953, Bishop was the only African-American in the U.S. Congress. He was the first African-American to sit on the Judiciary Committee, and the first to serve on the House Committee on Appropriations.

Bishop said in a prepared statement that he was ""deeply honored"" to have his name associated with the school.

""Duke has long been a model of excellence in higher education, and I will be glad to have my name associated with this institution,"" he said. ""I am deeply honored to be associated with this school. Public service has been a central part of my life since I was a young lawyer, and it will be a major part of my life in retirement.""

The Sanford School at Duke is the first of its kind in the U.S. and the first public policy school in the United States to be named after an African-American public official.

""It is fitting that the school is named after Sanford, a Jew who rose to prominence in the civil rights movement and who championed civil and economic rights throughout his career. It is fitting, also, that the school is named after Sanford because he was a student at Duke and he","The Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University is named after former Duke president and Governor Terry Sanford, who established the Institute for Policy Sciences and Public Affairs in 1971.

Give me a few key facts from the paragraph below,". All the institutions of the state are bound to the law, and are equally bound in conscience. and that the law is a living law, which it would be sinful to violate. ... In like manner, the civil authority, when it is given to it by the majesty of the state, when it is introduced by the laws of the state, or when it is intrusted to it by the people, is held by the people to be a person, and is a person in its own right. And thus, though the civil magistrate is a person, it is not a person in the proper sense, and cannot be regarded as a person in its own right, until he has been invested with the civil power. ...

... The case is precisely the same with regard to the church. The church, as a religious society, is not a person in the proper sense, nor can she be regarded as a person in her own right, until she has been invested with the civil authority. ...

The above paragraphs from the Federalist Papers show that the Founders did not believe that the federal government was the source of all law. They believed that federal law was subordinate to state law. The Constitution itself is the source of federal law. The U.S. Supreme Court has made this clear in a number of cases that deal with the supremacy clause. In the case of Gibbons v. Ogden the U.S. Supreme Court wrote: ""There is no doubt that the police power of a State may be limited by the constitution of the United States, and that the constitution of the United States may limit the exercise of the police power of the States.""

Since the states are sovereign, and the federal government is subordinate to the states, the states and not the federal government have the authority to prosecute crimes such as murder, drug trafficking, and other crimes.

In these cases the U.S. Supreme Court has said essentially this: The states have the power to prosecute crimes, but the federal government does not have the power to prosecute crimes.

Thus, the states are the only real source of the law of the land. The federal government is merely the agent of the states. The federal government cannot make federal crimes, only states can make federal crimes.

If the federal government makes crimes, then the federal government is the creator of law. But the federal government is not the creator of law.

That is why you cannot create a federal crime by amending the Constitution, as you","The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established on April 4, 1949.

How to book a river cruise

Need tips on river cruises?

River cruises are a popular way for travelers to experience the natural beauty and culture of European countries, and they're not hard to book. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind to help ensure you get the best cruise possible.

Most river cruises are priced per person, and while you can save money by booking your own cabin, there is no substitute for the experience of staying on a river cruise ship. You can occasionally find bargains if you're willing to pay a bit more. And if you absolutely must have the best cabin, there are several classes of ships, the best of which are luxury ships.

Not all river cruise ships are the same. While luxury ships are the most expensive, they provide the best cruise experience. Smaller ships, often called deluxe ships, are the least expensive, but they're also the least spacious. Some travelers prefer the coziness of the smaller ships, but the best river cruises are provided by the largest ships out there.

The best river cruises are the ones that include not only the cruise itself, but also shore excursions. While you can explore ports on your own, the best tours are provided by the cruise company.

River cruises are great for families and children, but there's no guarantee that your kids will be able to take part in all the activities. While some cruises include activities for all ages, most require that you book off-site activities.

Since river cruises are a shared experience, the best cruises are those that have a good balance between passengers and crew. While the cruise line may provide an upscale restaurant, the crew restaurant may be much more fun. And if you're a first-time cruiser, you're likely to get a taste of the culture more quickly by learning from the crew.

While there are a few different cruise companies, they're all pretty similar: they include ports, a ship, meals,","There are many great river cruises available for Europe.

Why democracy doesn't works and in old times we had autocracy?,". The only way is to use the same old argument that ""the poor people have no voice"" and ""have no choice but to make the best of it"".

I see that the government is making a lot of progress. The good thing about it is that it works.

But just where is this progress? It seems to me that the government is doing what it was doing long ago. It's just that instead of doing that, it's doing other things. And that's not progress.

So, while I'm not very keen on the system that I live in, I am very keen on what they are doing.

It's not only the government but the opposition as well. In the last election, they promised not to hike diesel price. The government has done exactly that. Because they had promised not to hike diesel price, I can't blame them for hiking the price. But they have done that. And the opposition are blaming the government for hiking the price. But that's not the right approach.

Morena: I think that the government is doing a lot of things right. The problem is that they are not doing what they are doing.

Yes, the government is doing a lot of things right. But it is doing things that are not right.

For example, they are giving a lot of concessions to the farmers. This is a very good thing. But I think that they should not give any more concessions to the farmers. The farmers should get no more concessions. Instead, the government should come up with a law that says that nobody should give more concessions to the farmers.

Morena: My point is that they are doing a lot of things right. But they are not doing what they are doing.

The government has made a lot of things right. But it is not doing what it is doing.

Morena: Sorry, I have to disagree with what you are saying.

I'm sorry to hear that. I think that you are wrong. But I don't want to get into a long discussion.

Morena: I think that you are wrong. You don't have to agree with me but you have to acknowledge that you are wrong.

I'm only saying that you are wrong. Me saying that you are wrong does not make me right.

Morena: If you don't want to talk, then don't talk. But if you want to talk, then let's talk.","Corruption, polarization, and misinformation all have the potential to easily influence democracy, which is a complicated system with many moving parts. It additionally will in general be sluggish and wasteful because of the requirement for agreement building and split the difference among various groups.

On the other hand, because there is no need to engage in a prolonged decision-making process or accommodate divergent viewpoints, autocracy can be more effective and decisive in implementing policies. Singapore, where the government has been able to achieve rapid economic growth and development through strong and centralized leadership, is a good case for autocracy. The nation has an exclusive expectation of living, low degrees of wrongdoing, and a well-working public framework.",0.4785,0.909401,10.749969,0.936382,0.416031,2.698057,-4.692563056945801

What is a Stock Broker?

What is a stock broker? A stock broker is a person or firm in the business of buying and selling stocks. They are the middlemen between the individual investor and the corporate issuer which issues stock.
The stock broker works with the corporate issuer to help the individual investor buy or sell shares of stock.
Who are stock brokers? Stock brokers can be individuals or they can be firms. Brokers can be full-service, or discount. Full-service brokers provide all the services a brokerage firm does, including research and advice. Discount brokers charge lower commissions than full-service brokers, but they may be unable to provide the research or advice that full-service brokers can.
What do stock brokers do? Stock brokers help individuals and companies buy and sell shares of stock.
The stock market is the largest, most liquid market in the world. So it's a","The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money.",0.276002,0.987112,23.624594,0.99187,0.297228,5.235361,-6.342386722564697

Can you potty train a bunny?,"iastan/potty-training-a-bunny/feed/0What does a rabbit say?http://www.pets.ca/pets-care/fun-with-animals/how-to-train-your-rabbit/what-does-a-rabbit-say/

In my experience, rabbits are not by nature very talkative. In fact, they are quite shy and reserved. They don’t like to be handled, and they are seldom willing to walk around with their head held high. They are also very sensitive to the presence of other animals (especially dogs), and it can be quite a challenge to get them to interact with other canines.

That said, if you are willing to be patient and keep your bunny motivated, she will surprise you with her advanced communication skills.

I have a friend who has a rabbit named Wes. When Wes was a baby, he was quite the talker. He would try to hop up on my lap and put his head in my hand, and he would try to talk to me.

The most common phrase I heard from him was “moo”! He would moo at anyone who came into his room, and he would moo at anyone who passed by. He would moo at the door if he didn’t like the way you were looking at him, and he would moo at the door if you didn’t answer his “hello”. I always thought that was pretty funny.

However, one thing that Wes didn’t like to do was to be petted. I tried everything to get him to do it, but it just wasn’t happening. One day, we decided to try a different tactic, and we went to the local pet store and bought a treat, a piece of carrot, and a bag of dry food. We also bought some treats for Wes to eat when he was in bed.

When we went back to Wes’s room, I sat down near the bed and gave Wes a carrot and a piece of dry food. I then placed","Just like cats, bunnies can be litter trained, which is why so many bunny owners are able to let their buns run free in the house.

How many seasons of Survivor has there been?,": It is quite a while.

The newest season of the reality show premiered on April 23rd, 2000 with the castaways taken from a tribe of 22 people to form two tribes of 23 people each. The show has been ongoing ever since. The show is similar to the original Survivor, with some differences. The format is similar, with the contestants going to an island where they can build a shelter, gather food and resources, and can vote out one of their fellow tribe members at the end of each day. However, one major difference is that the castaways receive food and resources for their tribe instead of keeping it to themselves and trading it for other items.

The show has been very popular and has been watched by millions of people around the world. The show has won numerous awards and has been nominated for many more. The show is now in its twenty-third season, with a different cast of people each time. The castaways are all from around the world and have different backgrounds. The show has been very successful, and this season is no different.

The castaways are all in the Amazonian region of Peru, and the tribe is called The Hidden Tribe. The show is filmed in the Cusco region of Peru. The tribe is led by a tribal chief, named the Chieftain. The Chieftain is very protective of her tribe, and has been known to rip off the arms of people who are not in line with her.

The tribe is made up of five men and ten women. The men are the leaders of the tribe, and the women are the camp followers. The tribe has a very interesting ratio of men to women. The tribe is made up of a father, a mother, and their daughter. The daughter is the oldest daughter of the tribe. The tribe also has a brother, a sister, a cousin, and a friend.

The tribe is made up of five people. The men are the Chieftain, the leader of the tribe. His name is Francisco, and he is an engineer. The second man is Oscar, who is a farmer and a chef. The third man is the leader of the tribe’s second tribe, which is made up of five people. His name is James, and he is a former soldier. The fourth man is the tribe’s youngest man, named Sebastian. He is the youngest at just 18 years old. The fifth man is the tribe’s youngest woman, named Santiago.",There have been 44 seasons of Survivor.,0.57621,0.995777,7.229881,0.942257,0.564261,2.061677,-3.8301920890808105
Give a comma separated list of all the people listed in this passage about Jesse LaFollette,".

A:

The people listed are:

Jesse LaFollette
Jesse J. LaFollette
Jesse J. LaFollette, Sr.
Jesse J. LaFollette, Jr.

""(from the list of people given, or from the list of people that I deem worthy of being mentioned)"" is a comma splice. I'd suggest:

""(from the list of people given or from the list of people that I deem worthy of being mentioned)""

or

""(from the list of people given or from the list of people that I deem worthy of being mentioned)""

Also, ""a list of people"" is a typo, as is ""(that I deem worthy of being mentioned)"" (the latter is often called a ""parenthetical remark"" or ""parenthetical phrase"").

Lately, I've been reading a lot of nonfiction - specifically on the topic of books and reading. I've been re-reading Toni Morrison's Beloved, thinking about how she uses the conventions of the romance novel to tell a story that is both uniquely hers and transcendent. I've also been re-reading Morrison's short stories, which are more about the writer's craft","Jesse LaFollette, Joseph LaFollette, Jean LaFollette, Phoebe Gobel, George Washington, Casimir Pulaski",0.198379,0.993449,2.643881,0.516486,0.181427,0.906724,-7.027166843414307
When was the Tesla Factory in Fremont purchased by Tesla?,"?

It's been said that Tesla was given a tax break by the State of California. Can someone please provide the info as to when this was done and what this means for Tesla?

The answer is that the factory was purchased in 1998 by Steve Jurvetson (the guy who grew up on a farm and went on to become a successful venture capitalist). The factory was purchased for $20 million, and the following year the State of California gave the company a $1.3 billion tax break.

New: Tesla Motors, Inc. (Nasdaq: TSLA) and the California State Board of Equalization are jointly committed to achieving a net tax benefit of $100 million over the next ten years for the State of California. That equates to an immediate tax credit of $87.5 million and a net tax benefit of $12.5 million over the next ten years.

the tax relief was done before the factory was built in 1998.

The tax break was done AFTER the factory was built.

For Tesla, the tax break was the difference between a $0 annual tax bill and a $2.7 million annual tax bill, which was surely not the outcome the state intended.

In fact, Tesla was recently on the verge of collapse due to the tax bill. The company has no cash and is burning through its cash-flow. The only way to pay off the tax bill is to sell more products, and that's not going to happen if the company is already in the red.

A:

The Great Depression is a period of severe economic crisis in the United States that begins in late 1929 and lasts for about seven years. It was named the Great Depression because it was the worst economic depression in the history of the United States; the worst since the Panic of 1873.
It was a result of the stock market crash of 1929 that has been called the worst crash in the history of the United States.
The stock market crash was caused by the bank failures, which began in mid-October 1929.
It was also caused by the collapse of the U.S. economy, which was centered in the automobile industry.
The U.S. economy was already in a crisis in the early 1920s, and it continued to decline in the 1920s and 1929. The stock market crash was accompanied by a worldwide depression of business activity.

As you asked for a term, I would say that the Great Depression in its entirety lasted from 1929 to 1933.  It's also known as The Roaring Twenties (or ""The Jazz Age"") because of the prevalence of jazz musicians and other cultural advances in that decade.  The Great Depression is the most notable depression in U.S. history and is often credited with having been the catalyst for the start of the Second World War.  
While it was a worldwide depression, the U.S. was one of the hardest hit countries.  The New Deal was implemented in 1933, in part to counter the effects of the depression.  The New Deal changed the direction of the U.S. economy and resulted in the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.  The New Deal also created some social programs, such as ""The Works Progress Administration.""  The programs of the New Deal are the most well-known features of the Great Depression.
This Wikipedia article has an extensive list of the effects of the Great Depression, including many of the social and political effects.

Q:

What can I do if I see a scumbag community moderator deleting comments?

I flagged a post on this site that was a comment and was deleted. The comment contained a link to a question on another stack exchange site. The commenter was caught in a lie. I flagged it as offensive.
The person who deleted the comment was a moderator, and everything points to this person being the same moderator of the other site.
I'm wondering what I can do in this situation. The comments were not rude or abusive, but I don't like the idea of a known moderator deleting comments.

A:

You can flag as ""other"", and explain in the comment why you think the comment should be undeleted.
The moderators are not all-knowing, and a moderator may not have the authority to undelete comments.

I'm not sure how it will turn out but I'm going to try to write a story about the cool things that happen during the year, the good, the bad and the ugly.

Here's a random thought, but once you get it going you can write your own story.

Maybe the first thing you do is call your parents and tell them you've been accepted to a school you've never heard of before.

Then you go find out what the test scores for that school are compared to your school. Then you can research what kind of jobs you can get at that school.

You can work for a private company that makes missiles, or for one that makes food or the other one that makes clothes or even a factory that makes stuff that will be used by the military.

Or you could work for a private company that makes furniture.

My dad is a furniture designer and I've worked for him.

I think you can make your story interesting.

The Search for the Origins of Rock and Roll

.

Rock and roll, born on New York's Tin Pan Alley, has always been a pop phenomenon, with almost weekly new songs and artists being released. Despite the changes and growth in popular music over the years, the basic elements of rock and roll have remained the same. It was in the late 40s and early 50s that the main elements of rock and roll began to form in the minds of most teenagers, and it was that time that gave rise to rock and roll songs.

The first rock and roll song was recorded in 1951 by a rockabilly singer, George Edwin Cole. The song was called ""Rocket 88"".

Cole, who had been playing the piano in a juke joint, would later say that he was influenced by the jazz of the time. He continued to write songs and played in a band with fellow musician Billy Lee Riley. Riley was influenced by the music of country and western, and would later name his band ""Riley and the Renegades"".

When the two musicians first started playing together, they would play songs they knew, but would also perform songs they did not know. One of the songs they played was ""Rocket 88"". After that, they would write music together.

They would eventually get the chance to record their music. They recorded at the legendary Sun Records studio in Memphis.

""Rocket 88"" was a hit. It was well received in the 1940s and 1950s. But it was not until rock and roll came along that the song really took off.

Some of the biggest rock and roll songs of the early 1950s, like ""Rocket 88"", had very similar music. ""Rocket 88"" was a combination of a guitar, drums, piano, and trumpet.

Another of the songs that were most similar to ""Rocket 88"" was ""Wolverton Mountain"", which was recorded in 1949 by a group called ""Cotton Pickin' Daddy and the Young Men"" (a group that was very popular in the 1930s).

In the mid-1950s, the most popular music was being recorded by various artists. The most popular artists were Bing Crosby, Frankie Laine, and Pat Boone. They were all big hits.

The music of the era was very popular. Teenagers were listening to music, and many of the songs were being","Rock and Roll was derived from Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, and Country music that became popular in the mid 1950s in the USA.",0.09611,0.976398,20.94127,0.995433,0.1053,4.622902,-4.994738578796387

I am a newbie in the whole sleep improvement business.  I got up at 6:30am every day until I was 29 years old.  I was a pro at getting up at the early hour, then I changed jobs and worked in the late shift.  I got used to it.  Then I changed jobs again, and worked for a longer period of time.  I got used to that.  Then I got married and had a child.  I am now working at home and I am still getting up that early.  Then I got a job with a bit more responsibility and got used to that too.  Then it became a bit more difficult to get up early.  I am now working at home but I am running a business.

Dr. Fauci: I think we were all quite fortunate that we did not have the kind of spread that we had in New York. In New York and New Jersey, it was a very, very different story.

So, it’s just a matter of spread. There’s no reason that the virus couldn’t have been spread in London. The only reason I can think of that it wasn’t spread in London, is that it was contained in those initial two or three days. And then, we had a pretty strong lockdown in London.

But, you know, I think it’s just a matter of the virus not spreading as quickly in London.

The other thing that we didn’t see in New York and New Jersey is how sick people got. We saw how sick people got in London, and now, we see how sick people get in New York and New Jersey. So, it’s just a matter of whether the virus was present in all those places at the same time.

And again, that’s why I think we were fortunate to have what we saw in New York and New Jersey.

Dr. Birx: And, I heard you say that we wouldn’t do it again. Okay. We’ve done this once.

Dr. Fauci: Yeah, but I mean, we’ve got to look at it, but I think there’s a lot of lessons learned, and I think that you can learn from this. And I think that, you know, when you’re at the point — we’re in the — we’re now at a point where we’re starting to see, I think, more and more of the spectrum of the illness, and we’re starting to — we’re seeing some of the severe illness, and we’re starting to see how the virus affects people differently. And that’s what we have to learn from this.

Dr. Birx: Well, I think that we have to learn from this. And what I mean by that is we have to be very careful in the future and have a plan for the future, and that is that we have to be very careful in the future to not have a situation where this virus can be transmitted again.

An RV is a motor vehicle or trailer that includes sleeping quarters, kitchen facilities and usually a bathroom. RVs are a popular way to travel since they provide many of the comforts of home while vacationing. There are many types of RVs, including class A, class B, class C,travel trailers, and truck campers..

Class A RVs are large vehicles built on heavy-duty truck or bus chassis and look like large Busses. Class B RVs smaller are built within van chassis (often called camper vans). Class C RVs are built on van or pickup chassis but the back is cutaway and a larger structure is added. Travel trailers are campers that are towed behind a truck or car and can range in size from very small to very large. Truck campers are carried in the bed of a pickup truck and provide a small, enclosed sleeping space.

RVs are very popular in the United States, with an estimated 11M households owning an RV.",0.091729,0.972954,6.485811,0.78057,0.097633,1.685739,-5.349182605743408

There are a number of texts that discuss the various rivers of Yemen.  
The most obvious to me is the Arabic text al-Majmu'a al-Fawātihah by the famous Yemeni geographer al-Maqrizi (d. 1670), published in 1878.  The book has a section called ""Mudhayyalat al-‘Ibriyyah wa al-‘Ibriyyah"" (The Rulers and Cities of Yemen).  The first part of the book is a list of the major rulers of Yemen, starting with the Hāshimid dynasty and going through the various dynasties.  The second part is a more detailed list of the cities of Yemen, based on al-Maqrizi's personal experience, classification, and research.
In spite of al-Maqrizi's reputation, no other Arabic work seems to have been written on the subject.  There is a Persian text called al-‘Ibriyyah wa al-‘Ibriyyah (The Rulers and Cities of Yemen), written in the late 19th century by an Indian scholar named Muhammad Sulaiman al-‘Ibri (d. 1900).  The book is poorly edited, and I haven't studied it carefully, but it is the only other work that I know of.
The English-language Wikipedia article on Yemen has a brief section on the various rivers of Yemen.  This article is quite old, but the map on the right is from a more recent English-language work, The Geography of Yemen: An Orientation Manual, by Martin Lings (1984).

A geographical dictionary of the Hijaz and Yemen by John Murray (1861)

"Which of these animals are domesticated: Dog, Cat, Serval, Monkey, Ferret, Goldfish, Lion, Bear, Sable",", Llama, Antelope, Rabbit, Calf, Pig""

The animal that was least domesticated was the ferret. Ferrets were kept by humans for hunting small prey, but are not considered a domesticated species.

Domesticated animals have more in common with their wild ancestors than they do with other members of their own species.

A domesticated dog is more closely related to the wolf than to other dogs, and in fact, domesticated dogs are more closely related to wolves than to wolves that are not domesticated.

The domestication process has added to the genetic diversity among domesticated species. Domestication has sometimes resulted in increased genetic diversity, and sometimes in genetic depletion.

Domestication of wild animals has resulted in the loss of many of their characteristics. Wild animals that are domesticated have become less varied than they were before domestication.

The domestic dog is the animal that most closely resembles its wild ancestor, the gray wolf.

Domestication of wild species has also resulted in the loss of many of the characteristics that they had before they were domesticated.

Domestication of an animal can sometimes be beneficial. This is particularly true for large animals that are unlikely to be able to survive in the wild.

Domestication and the development of agriculture have been linked.

The domestic dog is the animal that most closely resembles its wild ancestor, the gray wolf.

Domestication of the wolf likely occurred over a long period of time. The first domestic dogs were probably developed from the gray wolf, but it is not known when grey wolves became domesticated.

How to get the first anchor tag on the page by using javascript or jquery

I am trying to get the first anchor tag on the page by using JavaScript or jQuery. I know how to get all the anchor tags, but I can't seem to find a way to get the first one. The code that I have does work, but I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it, so if there is a better way to do it, I'd be glad to hear it.
var hash = window.location.hash;
var anchor = $(hash);

if (anchor.length == 0) {
    console.log(""there is no first anchor"");
} else {
    console.log(""there is a first anchor"");
}

Thanks in advance!

A:

Simply use the first method on the jQuery object:
var anchor = $(""a:first"");

A:

You can use jQuery's first() method:
var anchor = $(""a:first"");

I'm not sure if it's the best way to do it, but this works:

I have no idea what I'm doing, but I'm not going to stop.

I've been on a long hiatus from posting GIFs because I have pretty much given up on updating my GIFs via digital camera. And I'm not buying a camera for this purpose, because this is the internet. I therefore decided that I would work with my Instagram photos and create GIFs from them.

And this is what happened:

This is a fair amount of work. I'm writing this entire post in MS Word, because I have no idea what I'm doing, so it's faster than trying to write on the blog itself. But I'm doing it. I'm going to show you the end result.

I'm not going to go on too long about this. I'm just going to show a few GIFs, then I'll explain what I did.

I was inspired by a blogger named Cat GIFs. These are GIFs of cute cats. I love cute cats. The more I look at them, the more I want to make them. I want to make these GIFs, but I don't know how.

I decided I would do it like I would a screenplay. I would start by creating a storyboard. I would write out a short version of the story, then I would write out the scenes.

I then started making GIFs from my Instagram photos. I started with my favorite image, which is from a time when I was visiting a friend in Portland.

I'm not going to say what this photo is of, because I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

Here is a GIF from that photo. It's cut into four pieces, so you can see the four cats.

p.s. it is also, by the way, totally pointless to cite the US Constitution to justify e.g. the current administration’s policies. the US Constitution was written in 1787. the US is now over 200 years old and the US is already very different than it was 200 years ago.

p.s. I am not a fan of the US Constitution and the separation of powers. but it is the current form of the US Constitution. and that is the form it is.

I am not a fan of the US Constitution. I am not a fan of separation of powers. I do not think it is a simple matter of which is better. I think it is a question of what the people actually desire.

If the people as a whole desire separation of powers, then separation of powers should be the way to implement that.

If, however, the people as a whole desire not to have separation of powers, then there is no need for separation of powers.

If, however, the people as a whole desire not to have separation of powers, then there is no need for separation of powers.

That’s a good answer.

I think the reason that separation of powers has become a paramount issue is because of the type of government we have here in the US. I don’t think we’ve had separation of powers in a long time. There are more branches of government and more people in government than there are in any other democracy.

I like the US Constitution because I like the idea of a limited government. I’m not sure that would work in practice because the country seems to be moving toward a more centralized government.

Your daughter is very small for her age. I don't have experience with NICU babies, but I imagine that she will need more care than your average newborn. Babies who are premature or have low birth weights often have a higher risk for jaundice.
Also, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of her having a genetic disorder, or a digestive issue.

Oxidation reduction potential

Oxidation reduction potential. Oxidation reduction potential (EOx) represents the potential difference between the reduction potential of a metal and that of an oxidizing agent. The oxidation reduction potential depends on the metals in solution, the solution pH, the concentration of oxidizing agent, and the nature of the oxidizing agent. The potential is usually measured using cyclic voltammetry.

","Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water.",0.081776,0.061328,7.058322,0.642713,0.087567,1.586341,-14.290200233459473

You can use get_class and get_parent_class functions.

class User {
   public $users;

   public function __construct($user) {
      $this->users[] = $user;
   }
}

class AnotherUser extends User {
   public function __construct($user) {
      parent::__construct($user);

The United States Supreme Court has found that the federal constitution
enumerates the rights and privileges secured by the Due Process Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment.

This list is not exhaustive, but it clearly shows that the rights are not
limited to those enumerated in the Bill of Rights.

This issue is now before the Georgia Supreme Court in State v.

It is a fundamental principle of the common law that every right, however
traditionally denominated, should be available to a person accused of a crime.

The denial of these rights may result in denial of the privilege to plead
guilty and receive the sentence that would be imposed if the person had
pleaded not guilty, or in a verdict not supported by the evidence or contrary

Is learning piano on a keyboard just as effective as learning on a grand/upright piano?,"·ly or adv.

I've been using the keyboard for quite a while now and I'm finally able to play some of the songs I've been practicing. But I'm now worrying if I should continue using the keyboard over the grand piano. I feel like the keyboard is simply too stiff and I simply cannot play the notes fast enough. It's frustrating because I know that the keyboard is not the best instrument to learn on, but I am still learning the basic notes. I want to be able to play some of the songs I've been practicing, but it's simply too much of a struggle. Any idea what I should do?

I am a newbie pianist, and I was wondering if it was better to learn on an electronic keyboard or a grand piano?

I was told when I started that it was better to learn on a grand piano because the keys are easier to play, and you get used to the sound of the piano. But I have also heard that it was better to learn on an electronic keyboard because it is easier and faster to learn.

What would you recommend?

I was also told that if you are learning the piano, you should not go to a piano store to learn as you will be overwhelmed by the number of choices. So I decided to learn on my own, by reading about the different kinds of pianos and learning how to play one.

I have an upright piano and a grand piano. The grand piano is very beautiful, but I don't know how to play it. I know the notes, but I don't know how to play them fast. I play the upright piano a lot and I know what the notes are, but I haven't been able to learn to play them fast yet. I do want to learn to play the grand piano.

The two are very different things. Books are written by authors and are therefore static. Books are a permanent record of what has been written. They are the equivalent of a diary. They are the record of what has been imagined, what has been thought and what has been said. Books are a record of the ideas of a particular person, a particular time and a particular place.

A movie is a record of what has been filmed. It is the equivalent of a photo album. Movies are a snapshot in time and exist only in the memory of the person who has seen them.

When is an object considered a planet?,"'

Introduction
============

The discovery of planetary systems around other stars is one of the most exciting recent developments in astronomy. The fact that planets are so common around other stars gives us a unique chance to study and understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as the physical processes that lead to their formation.

Some of the most important questions in planet formation are whether planetary systems are common, and what characteristics do systems with planets have compared to those without.

Some of the most important questions in planet formation are whether planetary systems are common, and what characteristics do systems with planets have compared to those without.

The existence of multiple planets around the same star is now well established. The most recent results from the Kepler Mission [@borucki2013] show that at least one planet is detected in around 60 percent of all FGK-stars [@fressin2013].

The Kepler Mission
==================

The Kepler Mission [@borucki2013] is a space-based observatory with the mission goal of detecting Earth-like planets with periods between 20 and 80 days. The data collected by the spacecraft are searched for periodic signatures of periodic starspots, which would cause transit-like signatures in the light curves of the target stars.

The spacecraft continuously performs photometry of a set of 115 targets, which includes main-sequence and sub-giant stars, as well as red giants, white dwarfs, and eclipsing binaries.

The Kepler Mission consists of a spacecraft which orbits the Earth and continuously monitors a set of 115 targets. The spacecraft continuously performs photometry of a set of 115 targets, which includes main-sequence and sub-giant stars, as well as red giants, white dwarfs, and eclipsing binaries.

The Kepler spacecraft is based upon the bus design of the Explorer 1 spacecraft, and is built in the US by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation. The spacecraft is launched on a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA, USA, and is operated from the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA, USA.

The Kepler mission has greatly improved our understanding of the formation of planetary systems. The measurements of the transit time-correlations in the Kepler data, as well as the analysis of the transit signals, have led to the detection of multiple planets in systems around some of the brightest stars in the Kepler data [@borucki2011; @batalha2013; @burke2015].","To be considered a planet the object must have an orbit around a sun, have enough mass to form a mostly round shape, and must be the dominant gravitational force in the area with no other similarly sized objects that are not orbiting the object in question.",0.085493,0.996979,9.618425,0.988429,0.099921,2.35785,-6.066073417663574
What is the Azure equivalent of EKS?,": Is it possible to use EKS on Azure?

A:

With K8s, you can use the Azure Kubernetes Service which is a managed Kubernetes service that provides Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. It provides a single interface to deploy, manage and scale your applications in containers.
You can find more information about how to use K8s on Azure here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough

A:

You have the option to use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to launch Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. As you have mentioned, it is now also possible to deploy Kubernetes clusters in Azure using the Azure Kubernetes Service.
Azure Kubernetes Service

Azure Kubernetes Service is a managed Kubernetes service that provides Kubernetes clusters in the cloud. You can deploy a Kubernetes cluster directly to the cloud service, or you can use a Kubernetes-based service, such as Azure Container Service for managing the lifecycle of your Kubernetes cluster.
Azure Kubernetes Service is an easy-to-use hosted Kubernetes service that allows you to deploy, manage, and scale your applications in containers.

Azure Container Service

Azure Container Service is a managed service that enables you to easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.
Azure Container Service supports Linux containers, and you can use the Azure Container Registry to store your container images, or use a container registry of your choice.

Where is the best place to get married,"?

I am in a dilemma. I want to take my wife to India as the wedding destination to get married. I have visited India two times for work related purposes. I have stayed in Mumbai for a month and then in Bangalore for a month.

I am thinking about getting married in Bangalore, India. What do you guys think? I have been to a lot of places in my life but never been to Bangalore.

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

I think Bangalore is a great option, however, as an Indian, it isn't necessarily the best one. I am an outsider, so I can only speak from my perspective. I thought I would offer up some suggestions for everyone else to read through.

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

well, i think you should choose the best place, as a tourist or as a newly married couple. i have been to bangalore with my wife and we had a great time, just like how you can have a great time in any other part of the world.

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

I was married in Bangalore last year. It was a great experience. The location was awesome and the food was amazing (mostly because I am a fussy eater). The people are very nice and helping.

We also got married in a temple in Bangalore. It was a wonderful experience.

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

City hall was also awesome. I've been to other weddings there and it was great. However, I think you can have a good personal experience at a temple. Personally, we did it at an old fort location. The food was great, the weather was a little chilly, but it was really good.

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

Re: Where is the best place to get married?

I got married in Bangalore and my experience was pretty awesome. I actually got married in a temple and then we had a reception in a banquet hall. The food was great and the weather was perfect. The only downside to this experience was that we had to use the same food for both the ceremonies and it was pretty expensive. The staff was also pretty rude, but since it was my first wedding, I was kinda disappointed.

What is the biggest passenger airliner?," and the biggest cargo airliner?po.

A:

It's a bit hard to tell, because in a sense, the biggest passenger airliner is the one that carries the most people, but the biggest cargo airliner is the one that carries the most cargo.
A cargo airline (such as a freighter) can carry more cargo than a passenger airline, but not vice versa.  For example, the Boeing 747-400F freighter holds about 25% more cargo than the Boeing 747-8F freighter.  
The largest passenger airliner is the Boeing 747-8F, which holds about 225 people.  The largest cargo airliner is the Boeing 747-400F, which holds about 81 people.

A:

The largest passenger airliner is the Boeing 747-8F, which holds about 225 people. The largest cargo airliner is the Boeing 747-400F, which holds about 81 people.

The Boeing 747-8F holds 225 people. The Boeing 747-400F holds 81 people.
However, the Boeing 747-8F holds about 25% more cargo than the Boeing 747-400F.
The Boeing 747-8F carries about the same amount of cargo as the Boeing 747-400F, but the Boeing 747-400F carries about 25% more cargo than the Boeing 747-8F.

A:

It is hard to say, as there are many different things that can be measured.
But the most common is passenger capacity for passenger airliners, as it is the number of people that can board.
For cargo airliners the most common is cargo capacity.
Here is a nice (and complete) list of the largest passenger airliners:

Boeing 747-8F - 225 passengers
Boeing 747-400F - 81 passengers
Boeing 747-8I - 178 passengers

How many percentages of people in London prefer to walk?," the answer with the help of this infographic. It shows how many Londoners walk to work, work to train, work to school, work to the shops, work to the pub, work to the cinema, work to the gym, and work to the pub. How many, you ask ? Well according to a new report by the Greater London Authority, the answer is 11%.

The report also shows how many people in London drive to work, use public transport, cycle and use a private car.

The report also found that nearly one in five Londoners are obese, with the average weight of a Londoner being 1.6 stone.

The report found that over one in five Londoners have a low level of physical activity, with one in six Londoners in the most deprived areas of the capital not getting enough exercise.

The report also found that one in four Londoners are suffering with diabetes.

The report found that one in four Londoners are smokers – with one in ten not making a conscious effort to give up.

The report also found that one in four Londoners are obese, with one in five Londoners aged between 16 and 24 suffering with excess weight.

There is a growing trend for Londoners to get more exercise, with over a quarter of Londoners regularly exercising. Nearly one in five Londoners walk to work and one in five walk to the shops.

But there is still a huge disparity between rich and poor, with the least affluent areas having the lowest level of exercise.

The report also found that the best way to get fit for leisure or exercise is to walk or cycle for transport.

This is because walking and cycling are the cheapest forms of exercise and are also the most effective ways to get fit.

The report found that only one in five of London’s boroughs allow people to walk or cycle for leisure or exercise.

So, my friend, who I had previously mentioned that I would be getting a job at, called me up a few days ago to tell me that they are no longer hiring. The whole reason why I got the job is because they were looking for an artist and I was the best artist in the group, and they wanted me to be the artist. So, I was pretty upset, but I tried to keep my cool and act like it wasn't a big deal.

I was on the phone with them, and I told them that I would keep looking for things, but they told me that they were gonna have to let me go. I don't know why they would make me feel like I was going to be let go if they were still looking for artists, but I guess that's the way business works. They said that they told me that I was a good artist before, but they didn't find anything in their search to keep me.

Now, here's the thing. I hate to admit this, but I'm one of those people who hate it when people tell me that something wasn't good enough or they didn't like something I did. I mean, it's not like they are trying to be mean or anything, they could just be honest and tell me that they didn't like something I did. But instead, they just look at me like I'm crazy, and they say things like ""You know, I like your work, but...""

That's why I'm going to try my hardest to keep looking for jobs, but I'm not getting my hopes up. I haven't gotten any calls from anyone yet, and I'm still looking through the paper in the next few days. I might get a job, I might not, but I'm not gonna get my hopes up anymore.

The present invention relates to a method of forming a semiconductor device, and more particularly to a method of forming a semiconductor device in which a gate pattern is formed in a self-aligned manner by using a hard mask.
A metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is a type of field effect transistor (FET) which includes a gate pattern consisting of a pair of conductive electrodes formed on a semiconductor substrate and spaced apart from each other. One of the electrodes is the gate electrode, while the other electrode is the source or drain region. The gate pattern is insulated from the semiconductor substrate by an insulating layer. The gate pattern includes a gate insulation layer provided above the semiconductor substrate, and a gate electrode formed on the gate insulation layer.
The gate electrode is generally formed of polysilicon, which is typically formed by using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. However, the polysilicon gate electrode is easily damaged by an etching process for forming the gate pattern. To solve the problem, a hard mask for protecting the gate electrode","Many edible plants grow well in Maryland without human intervention including chickweed, purslane, dandelion, and lamb's quarters.

Give me a list of the top clean beauty brands for women in their 20s,"es that you recommend.

This article is so important, I didn't know about it. It's really the first time I've seen beauty brands catering to women in their 20s. I've been living in the dark ages with my ""skincare"" routine for years so it's really hard to change. I've been trying to get into the habit of putting an eye mask on before I go to bed and I've been doing that now for years. I guess I have been living in the dark ages. LOL

I think you're right that it's really important to put our skincare routine into the proper order. Also, I think it's important to have a good routine for cleansing and toning, but I've never really put much effort into it.

Well, I think you've chosen some good brands that are at the same level as the more famous brands but with less expensive ones.

I completely agree with you, but I've been living in the dark ages for a while as well. I think the key is to be able to easily separate the good things from the bad. The idea of a regimen is super important, but if you can't actually follow it, then it's pretty useless.

I think, the most important thing is to find a regimen that makes you feel good.

I've been using a regimen from Lush. It's called 'Lush Goat Milk'. I do it first thing in the morning, using a mixture of their face masks. I thought it was so interesting because Lush's products are a little more natural than the typical 'hypoallergenic' or 'organic' products that are out there today. It's a bit extreme for me, but I'm trying it out. I've been using it for 8 days now and I have not seen any side effects from it. I'm not sure how long it will take before I can see a difference, but I'm excited to try it. I don't know why I didn't try it before now!

I love this article! I've been going through a phase where I have been trying to find new skin care products for my face, and this is what I need to know. I have been using Neutrogena for years, and love it, but I need a new regimen. I thought I would have to buy a whole new brand, but your article has opened up a whole new world of brands for me.

When we go on telling stories, we can't help but keep telling them. And when we keep telling stories, we keep on enjoying them. So why do we like stories so much?

Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, and Kia are all great choices and all have reasonably sized cars. You can get a pretty nice thing for $25,000. You can get a good used car for $15,000-$20,000.

For a new car, I'd start with a used Camry or Accord and get the max you can afford.

Jr. is 4 and is small for his age, so a car seat should be fine. My kids are much older and much bigger and I still use Honda minivans.

If you don't want a minivan, the Mazda5 is a great choice. It's a small compact and has all wheel drive.

I'm not a fan of minivans but if you want one, Mazda5 is a great choice. I've had many Honda Odysseys (4 kids) and Honda CR-V (2 kids). They are a great car. My minivan was a Honda Odyssey.

If you get a reliable used car, you won't have too many problems with it.

I have a 2008 Ford Edge and it has been great. I just bought it and had to wait a week for it to get here back in December. I have one child and we have had a great time with it so far. We don't have a lot of stuff but it fits everybody nicely. I also have a 2001 Honda Pilot that I love to drive but the kids don't like it as much.

I've actually gotten the best of both worlds so far. I got a 2009 Ford Edge with 3rd row seating, it's great for the kids and I can use it for myself. If I get another kid, I'll probably get the Pilot.

I will be running a campaign for the 1st time in a while. I used to run a campaign for a long time, but it didn't have much of a theme to it. It was mostly chaos. I will be running a sandbox campaign in the same galaxy as the current one. My players are more interested in playing with me than playing for me.

I haven't decided yet whether or not to change the name of the campaign world, but I am thinking of calling it something else.

I have an idea for an adventure for the first couple of sessions of the campaign. I'll decide whether or not to run it after the first session.

I have a list of the players and their characters:

Kyle: Kyle, a lizard man. A good fighter. Also a thief.
Elder: Elder, a tree man. He also wanted to be a wizard when he was younger. Now he is a master of the arcane arts.
Griff: Griff, a goblin. He is a tank. He is a fighter.
Raider: Raider, a man who used to be a monk before becoming a mercenary. He is a good fighter and a slayer of goblins.
Vaz: Vaz, a lizard man who lives in his own house. He is a good leader and a good fighter. He has a pet that has his tail.

I have some ideas for the campaign, but I haven't decided whether or not to run them yet.

I am thinking of using the basic plot from the current campaign as the basis for the new campaign. I will be using the basic plot as a guideline, but tweaking it a lot.

How to live a long and healthy life?,", I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in December of 2010. This blog is my account of what's happening on the journey to beat breast cancer. I figure my story will help others who are going through the same thing. I won't tell you I'm in remission, because I'm not. This is my journey, I hope others will share their stories and experiences.

For those of you who have not seen the commercial on TV, it has been showing non-stop since July 1st.

I guess I'm late to the game, because I've watched it twice already.

I'm glad I am not on the pill, because I'm sure I would have gotten pregnant by now.

I was on the pill, but was on it for more than two years, so it was my choice to stop. I decided at the appropriate time.

The commercial is very well done and it is very emotional. I was amazed at how they portrayed what I expected to happen since my father died of lung cancer in 1985.

After the commercial aired on July 1st, I became more emotional. I don't know why, but I started crying.

I thought about my dad and how I wish I had spent more time with him. Also, I thought about my mom ... and how she was my rock.

I am also thinking about the woman who made the commercial. She is probably in her 40s and has breast cancer.

She is strong, she is surviving, she has a good attitude and she is not scared. I wish more people could be like her.

I know she is not cured, but she is beating it with no chemo or radiation. She is doing the things she wants to do.

I hope she has a long and healthy life.

The commercial has me thinking - I want to be like her when I grow up. I want to be strong, I want to live life to the fullest and I want to be happy.

I hope to be like her when I grow up. I hope to be as strong as she is. I hope to live life to the fullest and to be happy.

I am sad that I had to be diagnosed with breast cancer. This has been an amazing journey. I've had good times and bad times. It is amazing to me that I have been cancer-free for almost three years.

The Cambodian government has been arresting a number of journalists, bloggers and human rights activists.

The Cambodia Daily was founded in 1995 and has been one of the most prominent newspapers in Cambodia. It had a daily circulation of 12,000 copies with a readership of about 100,000 people.

The newspaper's editor and publisher, Chum Mey, was arrested on Monday, along with four other journalists, according to the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association.

All of the journalists were being held at Phnom Penh's Tuol Sleng prison.

The Associated Press reported that the group was being held without bail.

The Cambodia Daily's editor, Chum Mey, is the brother of King Norodom Sihamoni, the Cambodian monarch.

The arrest of Chum Mey came after a series of arrests of other journalists and human rights activists, many of them critical of the government.

Chum Mey's arrest was followed by that of the editor of the independent Khmer-language newspaper, the Tuol Sleng Khmer, Sang Channa.

The arrests have been seen as a move to muzzle the press and silence voices critical of the government.

Chum Mey is the founder of the Cambodia Daily.

Authorities have arrested a number of journalists and bloggers since the end of the civil war in 1991.

The country's Prime Minister, Hun Sen, has been in power for more than three decades and has run Cambodia as a one-man absolute rule since the communist Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975.

Cambodia has long been seen as one of the most repressive countries in Asia, with a strong military presence.

The country has a long history of human rights abuses, including the use of torture and forced labor during the war years, according to Human Rights Watch.

Cambodia's human rights record has been brought into question by the Cambodian Human Rights and Development Association (ADHOC), which has urged the United Nations to investigate the country's human rights record, according to","Estonia is a small European Union nation located in Northern Europe on the Baltic Sea across from Finland and bordered by Lativa to the south and Russia to the east.

What's an unpopular opinion you have?,"

I'm not positive I would have posted this on the first page, but I just came across this and I think it's a pretty good example of something that pisses me off quite a bit. I'm a very avid gamer and I have been playing World of Warcraft since release. I've been playing for quite some time, and I know what I'm talking about. I played a lot of other games before WoW, but I'm still a big fan of it. I've been playing a lot of MMORPGs and MMOs and I'm currently a huge fan of Rift and Planetside 2, which I played a lot of before recently.

The reason I'm posting this is to say that I really don't understand the need to constantly make a big deal out of ""we're not the best game ever, we're not the best game ever, we're not the best game ever."" It's just a game. That's it. It's a game, and it's just a game. It's not art. It's not literature. It's not music. It's not a movie. It's not a song. It's a game. It's a thing. It's not anything. It's just a thing. That's it. It is what it is.

I know I'm repeating myself here, but I'm just saying that I think people need to stop making a big deal out of it and just accept it. It's a game. It's just a game. It's not anything. It's just a thing. That's it. It is what it is. It is a game. It is just a game. It's not art. It's not literature. It's not music. It's not a movie. It's not a song. It's a game. It is what it is. It is not anything. It's just a thing. That's it. It is what it is.

So what do you guys think about this? Is it just a game? Is it nothing? Is it art? Is it music? Is it a movie? Is it a song? What's your opinion?

A study of simian immunodeficiency virus infection in macaques: relationship of infectiousness and CD4+ cell depletion to the risk of transmission.
We examined the relationship of infectiousness of macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection to the risk of transmission. For this purpose, we compared the infectivity and the mean CD4+ cell depletion in SIV-infected macaques that became infected after a controlled inoculation with SIVmac251 with those that became infected after a spontaneous infection with the same virus. The infected macaques were divided into three groups according to their infectiousness and CD4+ cell depletion. The group with the greatest infectiousness and the greatest CD4+ cell depletion was the group that transmitted SIV to four of five uninfected macaques, and the group with the lowest infectiousness and the lowest CD4+ cell depletion was the group that did not transmit SIV to any of the uninfected macaques. These results indicate that the risk of SIV transmission increases with infectiousness and CD4+ cell depletion. The present findings also support the conclusion that the spontaneous transmission of SIV to macaques is a result of the depletion of CD4+ cells during the early infection, and the risk of transmission is determined by the",Laskowice is a village in north-central Poland,0.263272,0.99679,5.163877,0.799903,0.312635,1.507296,-7.104074001312256

The diet is not high in fat as it is often thought of, but instead is high in monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil and avocado.
The diet contains some protein, with fish, eggs and dairy foods being the main sources.

What is IAAS?,"iving by, or that causes the loss of, the insured’s

horse, dog, or other domestic animal that is owned by the insured and

is named in the policy. See id.

      In support of his argument, appellant relies on the following

language in the insuring agreements:

      Insured’s horses, dogs, or other domestic animals that are
      owned by the insured and are named in the policy and
      those domestic animals that are owned by the insured
      and are named in the schedule or are being kept in the
      insured’s barn, stable, or in the insured’s garage or
      parking lot while unattended by the insured.

Appellant argues that the above language covers any loss to horses,

dogs, or other domestic animals “that are owned by the insured and

are named in the policy” regardless of whether the loss is caused by

the negligence of others. Thus, he contends that the trial court erred

in finding that the policy does not cover his loss. We disagree.

      The courts construe insurance policies as a whole, attempting to

give effect to all provisions to avoid rendering any provision nugatory.

See Downey v. Whaley, 857 S.W.2d 337, 339 (Tex. App.–Houston

[1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied). Under this principle, the courts

examine the language of the policy for the purpose of ascertaining the

intent of the parties as expressed in the policy language. See National

Union Fire Ins. Co. v. CBI Industries, 907 S.W.2d 517, 520 (Tex.

1995); see also Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schaefer, 124 S.W.3d 154,

158-59 (Tex. 2003). When the policy language is clear and
unambiguous, the courts construe the policy as a matter of law.

See Am. Mfrs., 124 S.W.3d at 158. However, if the contract is

ambiguous, the court construes the policy in such a way as to

harmonize its provisions, taking into consideration the type of

insurance, the nature of the risks involved, and the purpose of the

contract. See Schaefer, 124","IAAS is an acronym for Infrastructure-as-a-service and refers to the networking, storage, compute and virtualisation services the form the foundation of public cloud computing.",0.624385,0.981236,4.600473,0.988386,0.716775,1.582251,-9.038969039916992

My trophy does not fit my suitcase because it is to small.  I need to travel.  What could I do?,"ame.

A:

First, there is no way for you to carry a first-prize trophy with you.  Trophies have to be kept in a museum or other public facility, where they are on display.  This is a legal requirement; if the trophy is in your possession, you are breaking the rules.
As to the size of the trophy, it is not a legal requirement to have a trophy in the same size as the trophy used in the competition.  If the trophy is a smaller size, it is allowed to be placed in a bag, purse, etc.  However, it must be no larger than the bag in which it is placed.  You could borrow some large, roomy purses and belts from the friends of family that you are visiting.
Another option would be to purchase a smaller trophy.  You can find an excellent selection of small trophies at the Sportsman's Warehouse.  The small trophies are also very reasonably priced.

What is a water hammer?,".org waterhammer.org Water hammer is a sudden increase in the volume of water in a closed system.

The sudden increase in water volume leads to increased pressure on the water supply pipes, which may result in pipe bursts. Water hammer can cause damage to pipes, plumbing fixtures and other materials by causing them to vibrate.

The sudden rise in water pressure can also cause water to start flowing backward through a faucet.

When you turn on a faucet, a small amount of water comes out, but the flow increases rapidly. That's because water pressure builds up in your water supply pipe, until it reaches a maximum pressure.

The force of this pressure is called water hammer. If the supply pipe is too long, or if the pipe has a lot of friction, the water pressure is higher than the maximum pressure. The result is that the pressure inside the pipe suddenly changes.

Water hammer can cause pipes to burst. If the pressure in your water supply pipe is too high, the water supply pipe can burst.

You can avoid a burst pipe by installing a pressure reducing valve.

The most common type of pressure reducing valve is an aerator.

Other types of pressure reducing valves include:

Cockroaches can cause a water hammer problem in your home. cockroaches.org cockroaches.org Cockroaches cause water hammer problems that have been reported in various areas of the world.

The most common cockroach trap is the snap trap. snap traps.org snap traps.org A snap trap prevents cockroaches from entering the water supply.

However, snap traps do not prevent cockroaches from crawling into pipes.

The most effective way to kill cockroaches is to eliminate their food source.

You can remove food from the home by sealing food containers.

Also, you can seal the food supply pipes and change the water supply to a system that does not have any food.

Terms to Know:

Aerator:

Aerator is a device that you can place in the end of a water supply pipe. The aerator allows smaller amounts of water to flow out of the faucet. aerators.org aerators.org Water hammer aerators can be found at hardware stores where plumbing supplies are sold.

A:

The answer to your question is contained in the answer to this one, which is not quite a duplicate but is close enough for me to answer it.

The answer to your question is that there are no countries that have won more medals in total than the USA.  The table you linked to contains the medals won by each country in each Olympic Games.  The total of those medals is the number of medals you are looking for.
The US has won more medals overall than any other country, but the USA has never won more than 2 gold medals in a single Olympics.

Carter Center to Host International Summit on Preventing Violence Against Women and Girls

Carter Center will host a summit on preventing violence against women and girls in Atlanta, Ga., on April 23-24, 2013. The summit will bring together experts from the United States, United Nations, and the international community. The Carter Center is a nonprofit organization committed to advancing human rights, health, and democracy around the world.

The summit is part of the Carter Center’s global initiative, “Women and Girls First.” During the two-day summit, experts will discuss the impact of violence against women and girls on communities, families, and the global economy.

“Violence is a global problem, and we must work together to find solutions,” said Dr. Elahe Izadi, the Carter Center’s Executive Director. “One of the most effective ways to end violence is to focus on prevention.

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"

A:

It was the film industry.
From Wikipedia:

The film industry was established in Atlanta by the end of the 19th century. By 1901, several studios were in operation in Greater Atlanta, including Atlanta Film Company, Atlanta Film Manufacturing Company, Atlanta Motion Picture Company, Normandie Studios, and the Atlanta Film Exchange. In the early 20th century, production companies in the city became known as the ""Atlanta Film Trust"".

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry_in_Georgia
In addition, many movies were filmed in the state, including the film ""Gone With the Wind"" and the TV series ""The Dukes of Hazzard"".

A:

There are a few possible reasons.

Georgia's strategic location on the East Coast, just north of the Mason-Dixon line, and just south of the Appalachian Mountains
The fact that Georgia has a diverse population, both ethnically and racially, and many people speak English as their first language, and thus a higher percentage of the population is likely to be able to understand and speak English well enough to successfully act in a film, regardless of the language of the script
The fact that Georgia has a film industry.
The fact that Georgia has a large proportion of people who are very much interested in history and film, and thus a high number of people who would be interested in being in a film, regardless of the film's content

A:

I was born and raised in Atlanta, and the reason is because the same reasons as pointed out in the other answers are also extremely applicable in the surrounding areas of Atlanta.
The main reason is the proximity to the Mason-Dixon line, which makes it an ideal location to film anything that needs to take place in the mid-Atlantic states.
Georgia also has a very diverse population, making it a very attractive location for filming. The state is home to many different ethnicities and races, and many of them speak English well enough to be able to act in a film.
The state is also home to many famous people, which makes it an attractive location for filming. Many of the actors and actresses who have come from the state have gone on to be very successful in Hollywood.
Georgia also has a very large historical significance. The state is the birthplace of Martin Luther King Jr., and was home to many other influential leaders. Many","While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.

I'm having some trouble with my sailboat and need some advice. I'm an experienced sailor, but have never owned a sailboat. In order to help me get into the sport, I'm looking to rent one for a week or two at a time from the Chesapeake Bay. My husband and I are looking at a nice, relatively small sailboat to use for this. I'm looking for a boat with a moderate amount of horsepower, like a 30 HP or more, but not too much. It's my first time out in a sailboat, so I need a boat that I can easily learn on.","Here are some potential slogans for your boat rental company:

Second, vary the lighting conditions. Revisit your familiar photo spots at different hours - during the sunrise, sunset, at noon, in pitch darkness and of course, during the golden hours when the world around you embraces that warm glow.

Third, limit your gear options. Do you love zoom lenses? Try committing to a single prime lens for your next photo walk. Try out a super-telephoto lens for a landscape shot. Use a wide angle lens for a portrait photo. Limiting your gear options will force you to worry less about which lens to use and think more about getting the shot with the unique constraints you have.

Fourth, take some time to look around with your eyes before looking through the viewfinder. Take a look at the scenery. Imagine - without looking - how your lens will render the scene. Think ahead about the depth of field you want, think about the composition ahead.

Resident Evil: Retribution is a survival horror video game developed by Capcom and published by Capcom for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Retribution is the fifth main installment in the Resident Evil series, as well as the first to be released on current generation consoles. Its gameplay is similar to the Resident Evil 5 and Resident Evil 6, and is set in the Hive, a dangerous and desolate area of the Raccoon City Police Department's sub-basement, where the player must use a flashlight to explore an area riddled with zombies and other monsters, where weapons are scarce. The game was released worldwide on August 28, 2012.

Retribution was announced by Capcom in 2009, and was later revealed at the 2009 D.C. Comic-Con in July of that year. It was later confirmed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on June 8, 2012, with the game's official release date set for August 28, 2012. The game received favorable reviews from critics, who praised its improved graphics and controls, and criticized the lack of gameplay variety. It was commercially successful, selling over 2.8 million copies by the end of 2012, and was a commercial success in its native Japan, selling over 640,000 copies by the","Action - Die Hard, No time to Die

WEST CHESTER, Pa. – An East Price Hill woman was struck by a car while walking on the sidewalk.

Cheyenne White, who lives in the area, said she was crossing the street at the intersection of West Chester Pike and Jackson Pike, in the area of the Tower Shops, when she was hit.

White said she was walking across the street to catch a bus when she was hit.

“I fell to the ground and then I looked up and I saw a car coming at me and I asked ‘Did you see me?’ and the driver said ‘No, I didn’t see you,’” White said. “I just started screaming and the girl who was driving her car pulled over and she got out to check if I was okay.”

She said the driver then told her she had hit a pedestrian. The incident happened around 5 p.m.

Police said it appears White was crossing the street against a crosswalk, which is not safe.

“The traffic signal was not obeyed and the pedestrian was struck,” West Chester police said in a statement.

White was taken to The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. White’s injuries were not considered life threatening.

The old man was an eccentric genius of mental illness. He was a medium-sized man, standing about five-feet-eight with thinning grey hair, but a sharp, intelligent face and a powerful body. He walked with a slight stoop and was in his middle-age by the time he had been committed to a long-term psychiatric institution. His mind was so active that his body was little more than an old man’s shell.

The old man had a gift for the absurd and his mind loved practical jokes. He was a master at them. He loved to hide things in plain sight, like a magician at a magic show.

In the last few weeks, I’ve gotten a few questions about how to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use Maven, and how to make it work with a particular Maven repository. Hopefully, this blog post will help to answer those questions.

As with many other projects in the Java community, IntelliJ IDEA is written in Java and uses Maven as a build tool. IntelliJ IDEA also ships with a module that allows it to work with a particular Maven repository. In some cases, you may want to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use another Maven repository.

The following diagram explains the configuration of the IntelliJ IDEA module.

The IntelliJ IDEA module

In the IntelliJ IDEA module, there is a property called maven.settings.xml . This is the file where you can configure the module to use a particular Maven repository. The maven.settings.xml file contains the following lines:

<settings> <module> <id>idea</id> <activation> <property> <name>idea.settings</name> </property> </activation> <module> <id>idea-maven</id> <activation> <property> <name>idea.settings</name> </property> </activation> </module> <module> <id>idea-maven-data</id> <activation> <property> <name>idea.settings</name> </property> </activation> </module> </settings>

The ids of the two modules are defined as follows:

"Without quoting directly from the text give me a short bulleted list of the regions in the Pokemon universe, categorized by the real world places they are supposed to be based on.",", it's just a shoehorn to get around the fact that they don't really live in the real world.

They have a homeworld, albeit not a very hospitable one. They have a home turf, but they don't have a home. They have a ""home"" of sorts, a home for their homeworld, but it doesn't have the same meaning as the word ""home"" in the real world.

Then, just make a list of the regions of the Pokemon universe. Examples:

Pokemon X has a region called Hoenn.
Pokemon Y has a region called Unova.
Pokemon Z has a region called Kalos.

And so on.

I think it should be something like this:

Pokemon Kanto is based in Japan.
Pokemon Sinnoh is based in Southern Japan.
Pokemon Johto is based in Southern and Northern Japan.

Pokemon Kanto and Sinnoh are based in real life Japan. Pokemon Johto and Kalos are based in the fictional Johto region.

I think the reason we don't see a map of the region is because the region can't be mapped. It's a land of water, which can't really be mapped.

EDIT: The reason they don't have homeworlds is because they have no home. They live on the water and that's it. Unless they have been to the land masses and can be measured by the areas they lived in, they can't be home.

So, they have no home in the real world, and so they don't have a homeworld.

A:

The first is an adjective that describes a person. It is the name of a place, as FDR is the name of a city in the U.S. But, unlike the other two, it does not change. It is not a noun, so it can't be used after a noun (like Ethel or George).
The second is a noun. It is used to describe a person, an animal, or a place. It is often used as a name for that person (e.g. ""my dad's dog is named George""). It is also used as a name for the place (e.g. ""my dad's dog lives in the city of New York"").

"From the paragraph, tell me what is a dredger","?

    I am working in a project involving the dredge and haul off the bottom of the ocean.

    I have to explain the process of dredging and how a dredge works in one of my report.

A:

A dredger is a ship that dredges the seabed.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between the histone variant H3.3 and DNA methylation during mammalian embryogenesis. H3.3 is a member of the histone H3 family that is deposited by the HIRA complex as the major variant in embryonic stem (ES) cells and is considered to be a marker of transcriptionally active chromatin. In contrast to other histone variants, H3.3 is not incorporated into chromatin, but its deposition is required for transcriptional activation by active enhancers. A recent study has shown that H3.3 is methylated at lysine 79 in ES cells, but not in differentiated cells. Since H3.3 is also methylated at lysine 4 and lysine 9 in differentiated cells, H3.3 methylation is suggested to mark a subset of genes that are silenced in differentiated cells.

To investigate whether H3.3 is involved in the maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells, we investigated whether H3.3 is methylated in ES cells. We found that H3.3 is methylated at lysines 4 and 9 in ES cells and that H3.3 methylation is maintained in ES cells in culture. However, demethylation of H3.3 seems to occur upon differentiation of ES cells, although epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the process. We also found that H3.3 methylation marks a subset of genes that are strongly expressed in ES cells, but are silenced in differentiated cells, and that genes whose expression is activated upon differentiation are not marked by H3.3 methylation.

To investigate the relationship between H3.3 methylation and the establishment of DNA methylation in ES cells, we analyzed the methylation status of H3K4 and H3K9 in ES cells and found that H3K4 methylation is detected in ES cells, whereas H3K9 methylation is not detected in ES cells. After differentiation, H3K4 methylation was lost and H3K9 methylation was newly detected in differentiated cells. These results indicate that H3K4 methylation is important for the establishment of DNA methylation during the differentiation of ES cells.

Finally, we investigated whether the differentiation-induced loss of H3K4 methylation is a",A dredger is a specialist floating plant used to do excavation of material from a water environment. This process is called dredging.,0.266055,0.998778,3.902557,0.868018,0.276653,1.262412,-5.552135467529297

My Salt, Sugar & Vinegar

I've been craving a little bit of sugar lately. I don't know why. When I started eating sugar, it was the only thing I'd really crave and now I find myself craving all kinds of things. It could be that I've been eating mostly meat and potatoes lately or maybe it's just the season. Whatever it is, I'm not looking forward to winter. To be honest, I've been kind of sad since summer ended. I miss the sunshine, the beach, the warm weather, the beach...you know. I really miss it and I'm not looking forward to winter. I don't know why, but I'm ready for summer to come back.

I'm not sure why I'm craving sugar, but I'm trying to get rid of it. I've been eating pretty much nothing but meat and potatoes and with Thanksgiving coming up I need to add a little something to my diet. I decided to try out a new recipe for dressing, which was very simple and easy. I'm not sure if I'll be able to eat the whole thing, but I'll give it a try.

Ingredients

3/4 lb ground beef

1 can tomato sauce (I used Rotel)

1/2 head of cabbage, shredded

1/4 cup green onion, chopped

3 Tbsp sugar

3 Tbsp vinegar

1 Tbsp mustard

1 Tbsp salt

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1/4 tsp pepper

1/4 tsp celery seeds

3 Tbsp water

Directions

Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. You can either put it in a crock pot or use a big skillet to make it easier.

What is the best way to make a camp fire,"?

I was up in the woods last night and started a fire in a tree. I used a
wooden stick to push it over and had to run to get away from the flames.
I had forgotten that the wood would ignite in the fire.  I got back to the
fire and found that it was out.  The fire was burning in a circle and I
could tell that it had burned out.  I was so tired and cold that I didn't
think to look for the sticks.  I think that I can use the small twigs to
make a fire in the fire pit.  Is that the best way or is there a better
way?  Thanks for your help.

You could use

    for obj in list_of_objects:
        if not obj == obj2:

Before you start the fire, get all of the necessary components such as dry kindle/twigs, larger sticks, and larger logs, paper, and lighter
Step 2.   Build a small tepee shape with the dry kindle and dry small logs.    I would recommend adding paper with the kindle to assist in starting the fire.
Step 3.  Stack larger sticks around the teepee structure in a square formation.   Build up multiple levels, so the square structue is higher than the teepee.   This will help the fire expand and spread to the surrounding structure.

What are the top reasons to become a vegan?,".se

I'm not sure I'm on the same page as you. I don't think most vegans give your argument much consideration.

I think you believe that humans are omnivores, and that vegans have a point when they say that we do not need to eat animals. The problem is that the vegan argument is not based on science, it's based on religion.

I'm not saying what you believe is wrong, but it's not science. I know that meat eating has been around for a long time, and I know that the evidence shows that it is harmful.

I understand that the evidence shows that there is not enough protein in vegan diets to build the muscle mass necessary to be an athlete. I also understand that the evidence shows that vegans have a higher rate of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.

I would not recommend a vegan diet to someone who wanted to be an athlete.

The evidence doesn't show it. If you read what I said, I'm sure you would agree that I didn't say they were unhealthy. I said that there was no evidence that they were healthy.

I know that you believe that humans are omnivores. You are wrong.

I also know that you have no evidence that vegans have a higher rate of diabetes than omnivores. I don't know what you are basing that on, but I'd like to see the evidence that you are basing it on.

I am a vegan, but I do not think that it is healthy for anyone, omnivore or not. I don't think you should ever try to tell a vegan that they are wrong.

Cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are all diseases that are caused by lifestyle. They are not diseases that can be cured.

"In the series A Song of Ice and Fire, who is the founder of House Durrandon?",", is the founder of House Durrandon?

A:

A Song of Ice and Fire, The Lands of Ice and Fire:

House Durrandon is a minor House in the Kingdom of the Rock. Founded by Lord Ormund Durrandon, the house is notable for being the first to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms. It is also notable for being the first House to have a sigil and therefore the first House whose claim to a seat in the Red Keep has been denied.

So, House Durrandon is the first House to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms.

A:

House Durrandon is the first House to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms.
I've always thought that the ""first House"" to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms was House Stark, who is the first House to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms.
But in The Lands of Ice and Fire, it is House Durrandon who is the first House to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms.
This is because House Stark was not a military House but was a merchant House.
There is a mention of the first House to raise an army against the crown of the Seven Kingdoms in this excerpt from A Storm of Swords, Chapter 10:

""But the king's men had a new lord commander, the Duke of the Mountains. His name was Wyman Manderly, and he was a sour man who liked the taste of war but not the smell of it. He'd never raised an army, and he said so plainly. ""

and

""Lord Wyman of the Mountains had no taste at all for fighting, and he didn't much care for the smell of campfires either, as he was the first to admit. But he liked the taste of gold, and he joined the war as soon as he could.""

and

""The first battle raised by House Stark was the Battle of the Mander, against the lords of the Reach and the men of the Mountains. It was a bloody affair, and the first one where the Starks of Winterfell picked up their first laurels.""

"Summarize the meaning of ""Lovers"" in the slogan ""Virginia is for lovers""","s us to a crucial scene in the film. The opening of the film, set in the 1930s, shows a group of people riding in a limousine. The musicians are playing ""The Virginia Waltz"" and singing ""The Virginia Waltz."" One of the passengers, a young man, is staring out the window, and when the ride is over, he joins the others in singing ""Virginia is for lovers."" In this way, the film suggests that love is the meaning of Virginia.

The film begins with a text-based narrative that ends with a voiceover by a narrator, ""There are those who believe Virginia is for lovers. Others, of course, believe it is for fun. I believe it is for both."" The opening scene is the narrator's voiceover, and as the camera pans across the landscape to the ocean, the words ""Virginia is for lovers"" flash on the screen. The narrator then begins his explanation of the film:

The people who believe Virginia is for lovers are correct. Virginia is for lovers. Virginia is for lovers because there is no movie that is more consistently romantic, that is more romantic than Virginia. Love is all around us. Love is everywhere. And Virginia is for love.

The narrator then explains the romanticism of the movie:

Virginia is for lovers because Virginia is a beautiful place, Virginia is a beautiful place, Virginia is a beautiful place. Virginia is a beautiful place because there is no movie that is more consistently romantic. Virginia is a beautiful place because the movies are the only thing that makes Virginia beautiful.

In several scenes, the narrator talks about the romance of the landscape, the romance of the people, and the romance of the film. The narrator specifically says that ""Virginia is for lovers because there is no movie that is more consistently romantic."" The narrator's comments about the romance of the landscape and the people provide an interesting contrast because the narrator is saying that the landscape is romantic, while in the same breath, he also says that the people in the film are romantic. In other words, the film itself is romantic and the romance that is portrayed in the film is also romantic.

The narrator's repeated use of the phrase ""beautiful place"" also provides a clue as to the meaning of ""Virginia is for lovers."" The narrator describes the landscape as ""beautiful"" and ""the movies are the only thing that makes Virginia beautiful."" He then adds that ""Virginia is a beautiful place because there","- ""Virginia is for Lovers"" is a tourism and travel slogan adopted by the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) since 1969
- The ""lovers"" in the slogan was originally attached to qualifiers such as history lovers, beach lovers, and mountain lovers. The qualifiers were considered too limited and eventually dropped
- Contrary to claims, the word ""Lovers"" in the slogan bears no reference to the United States Supreme Court's case Loving v. Virginia which legalized interracial marriage in  1967",0.126281,0.999075,21.904255,0.99871,0.133249,4.832314,-3.7403430938720703
What items can be easily composted at home?,"ard.com/composting-guide-29-items-can-be-composted-at-home

Once composted, what is the best time to put it in the garden? A good rule of thumb for vegetables is to put them in the garden when they are about 3-4 inches tall. This will give the roots a good start and the plant a chance to set a few roots down before the last frost.

How long does it take for a compost pile to break down? Some people will tell you that you should start composting as soon as you get it, but the truth is that it takes a bit longer to break down a pile of fresh food waste than it does one that has been sitting in a bin for a few months. To speed up the process, it’s a good idea to turn the pile every other day with a pitchfork, or with a shovel or garden fork. If you leave it alone for more than a few weeks, you should also add more kitchen scraps and other materials to the pile.

How can you tell if your compost pile is ready to use? At this point it’s a good idea to take a few handfuls of the compost and sit it on a piece of paper in a container. Let it sit for a day. If the material doesn’t crumble to pieces, it’s ready to use.

How can you keep your compost pile from stinking? It’s a good idea to have a little pile of sawdust with a little wood ash on hand, as well as a shovel or other digging tool. When you are digging holes for your compost pile, it’s a good idea to bring a couple of handfuls of sawdust into the hole to cover the waste so that it doesn’t attract flies.

How do you get rid of the smells in your compost pile? It’s a good idea to mix in some lime to the pile to help neutralize any unpleasant smells. You can also add blood meal and other organic matter to the compost pile to help absorb the smells.

Can you compost broken glass? Yes, you can compost it. Just be aware that if you put broken glass into your compost pile, it will eventually break down and release chemicals which are potentially toxic. So, you should avoid putting it in the compost pile.

MILWAUKEE (WITI) -- Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele will meet with the Milwaukee Bucks","For a home compost bin, it is important to only compost things that can be easily turned to soil an won't attract animals or pest. Thus, you can compost fruits and vegetables, egg shells, coffee grounds, paper products like newspaper or cardboard (if ripped into smaller pieces), and yard waste like grass clippings and leaves. 

In a commercial compost, oily food scraps, dairy, meat, and bones can also be composted. It is better to leave these items out of a home compost bin.",0.472462,0.009695,19.310209,0.662008,0.414438,4.173763,-4.515322208404541

What is Cuneiform?,".org

Cuneiform, or cuneiform script, was a writing system used in the Middle East and Asia from approximately the 16th to the 12th centuries BC. It is the earliest known writing system to use wedge-shaped signs, and was the first to be devised with a systematic and consistent set of signs, although many variations on the system were used in different parts of the world.

Cuneiform writing is considered a precursor of the alphabet. It was devised in Mesopotamia, around the city of Uruk, on the banks of the Euphrates river, around the year 2800 BC. The system was developed over time by the Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians. In the later part of its existence, cuneiform became the main script for the Old Testament of the Bible.

Why was it used?

The Sumerians and Babylonians used cuneiform because they were in contact with one another. The Assyrians, however, used it as a way of reinforcing their power and control of the people of Mesopotamia.

Cuneiform was used as an artistic medium for all manner of things. But the principal use of cuneiform was in the form of seals. They were not only used to signify ownership, but also to seal contracts, and to seal letters.

The use of cuneiform in the script of the Bible

The Bible was written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek and other languages. Cuneiform was included in the Bible of the Old Testament. It is found in the Hebrew Old Testament, but often in difficult to translate English forms. The most common example of this is the word 'adam' which means 'man' in Hebrew. There are several translations into English for this word, but the one that is used most often is 'human', because it is used nearly 1,000 times in the Old Testament.

Cuneiform in the Old Testament

In the Old Testament, cuneiform script was used to write a number of things, such as:

The name of God, YHWH

The names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and their leaders

The names of the kings of Israel, Judah and the other tribes of Israel

The name of the city of Jerusalem

The names of the people of Israel

The names of the kings of Assyria, and the names of the kings of Egypt",Cuneiform is a logo-syllabic script that was used to write several languages of the Ancient Middle East. The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era. It is named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) which form its signs. Cuneiform was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system.,0.307118,0.984245,17.046815,0.990956,0.293955,3.924618,-4.930805206298828

What is the difference between a bath and a shower?,"elThe effect of aripiprazole on cortisol and prolactin levels in patients with major depressive disorder.
Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, has been shown to have dopamine D2 receptor partial agonistic activity in the rat. In humans, aripiprazole is known to have a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2 receptor. This study aimed to assess the effect of aripiprazole on cortisol and prolactin levels in patients with major depressive disorder. A total of 30 patients with major depressive disorder were enrolled in this study. They were divided into two groups, with 15 patients in the aripiprazole group and 15 patients in the placebo group. At baseline, and at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the start of treatment, patients were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Throughout the study, patients also underwent assessment of cortisol and prolactin levels at baseline and at the end of the study. Cortisol and prolactin levels were measured using radioimmunoassay. Cortisol levels were significantly decreased at all time points in the aripiprazole group. However, no significant difference was seen in cortisol levels between the aripiprazole and placebo groups. Although prolactin levels were significantly decreased in the aripiprazole group, the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, aripiprazole was effective in reducing cortisol levels in patients with major depressive disorder. Moreover, aripiprazole was more effective than placebo in decreasing cortisol levels at 8 weeks.Q:

Halal food is a word used to refer to the food that is permissible to eat in Islam. The term halal is the Arabic word for permissible. Halal food is food that has been prepared in accordance with specific rules set out by the Islamic religion.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Allah says: ‘Verily, I have permitted for you only that which is good for you and your food is lawful to you and yours only’. (Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim)

The rules that govern the preparation and consumption of halal food are called ‘halalah’. ‘Halalah’ is the Arabic word for ‘permissible’.

Should we all use Qubes OS for most daily task that involve the internet?,"

I have been using Qubes for some time now and really enjoy it. However, I am wondering if it is practical to use all the time, for the most common internet activity.

I have a few questions about that:

1) Is it possible to install VMs in Qubes OS so I can have the ""normal"" internet access, while at home, but behind a NAT firewall? I would like to be able to access specific sites and have the protection of the firewall and maybe a VNC server.

2) I like to use an IMAP client. Is it possible to use the Qubes firewall to keep the IMAP server safe, so I can use it from outside the firewall, but still have it accessible from inside the firewall?

3) I use qBittorrent frequently. Is it possible to have qBittorrent running behind the firewall, without it being able to access the outside world? Can I use the firewall to control access to qBittorrent?

1) Yes, you can install VMs to have the normal Internet access and you can run an IMAP server if you want. Note that you need to set the firewall to allow incoming connections to your local VMs. The VMs should be running on the same box as you are.

2) Yes, you can use the firewall to control access to your IMAP server. The router should have a firewall solution, so it should work.

3) Qubes doesn't support qBittorrent, but you can use something like Tornado Web Server to host the qBittorrent executable.

4) I can't create VMs in Qubes, but you can create a Qubes VM and use it as a router to your local host.

4) I can't create VMs in Qubes, but you can create a Qubes VM and use it as a router to your local host.

Very nice. I will give it a try.

My answer is:
oak
pine
spruce

A:

They are all deciduous, because they drop their leaves at the end of the growing season, then set them down to rest and regrow.
To classify a tree as deciduous or evergreen, you must first identify what time of year they are in their active growing period. Deciduous trees drop their leaves in the fall, and regrow new leaves in the spring. Evergreens do not drop their leaves, and grow new leaves all year long.

Mini-golf

Mini-golf

Mini golf is a sport in which players attempt to get a hole-in-one with a miniature golf ball, often with an attempt to hit the small ball into the hole in the smallest number of strokes. Miniature golf was invented in the 1930s in the United States.

Mini golf has been popular in the United States since the early 1990s. The miniature golf course industry was estimated to be worth $1 billion in 2011, and is growing at a rate of 8% per year. Mini golf is also becoming popular in other parts of the world.

In the United States, the first modern mini-golf course opened in Easton, Pennsylvania, in 1994. Since then, the number of mini golf courses has grown at about 100 per year. In 2011, there were about 1,100 mini-golf courses in the United States.

The game got its name in the 1980s, when it began to appear more frequently as a children's game at state fairs and amusement parks. Mini golf is also a common game at par-3 and miniature golf courses and putt putt courses in the United States.

The U.S. Army has a miniature golf course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In July 2009, the course was damaged by a tornado that hit the area. The game experienced a surge in popularity in Japan in the early 2000s.

Name some famous 20th century Russian composers.,".edu.uk

The music of Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the most celebrated composers of the 20th century, may be taught in a new course titled “Rachmaninoff and the Music of the 20th Century” at the University of Memphis.

The course will be held through the University’s Center for Creative Leadership and will provide students with the opportunity to explore Rachmaninoff’s life, music and legacy in a way that is not possible in any other setting.

The course is scheduled to begin in July and will include a one-credit hour course in music performance and a two-credit hour course in music theory and history. The course will also include a one-credit hour internship in which students will be required to write about Rachmaninoff.

“Rachmaninoff was one of the most prominent composers of the 20th century, and his music has a huge influence on contemporary music. Students will be able to study Rachmaninoff’s music in depth and understand his life and his legacy through this course,” said Dr. John McFerrin, director of the Center for Creative Leadership and the course instructor.

“We are very excited about the opportunity to present Rachmaninoff to the University of Memphis community. We are proud to be able to offer this course, which is consistent with the University’s motto, ‘Service beyond self’,” said Dr. Demetrius Edwards, Dean of the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences.

Dr. Edwards said this course is especially appropriate for students in the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences because Rachmaninoff’s music is deeply embedded in their training as music educators.

“The study of Rachmaninoff’s life and music will help students understand the composer’s work better, and Rachmaninoff’s music can be used to create an atmosphere conducive to self-discovery and self-expression,” said Dr. Roger Allen, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

This is a very important stage of your baby's life and you should be","What to feed your baby depends on a number of factors ranging from their age, their health and your preferences. Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults — this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like — the baby leads their own feeding.

What are some ways to care for a new tree," a tree at home?

A:

You can plant it in a pot and keep it in a sunny window.
I have a grandparent's rose bush that lives in a large terracotta pot.  I water it and it has grown for three years so far.  I have to water it about every week.  It gets quite dry between waterings, but it still hasn't died yet.  (The soil dries out quite a bit because it's outside.  I water it every week, and the soil is always damp to the touch when I do.  If I don't water it for a week or two, it looks very dry).
I don't think it needs any special care, but it does need to be watered.  If you don't want to take it inside, you could always put it in a pot (a pot with drainage holes) that is kept in a sunny window.  Its roots would still be exposed to the air, but it will be protected from the wind, rain, and snow.

 - Frequent watering.  The amount of water and frequency will vary depending on the tree and climate but frequent, deep watering is essential for early development.
 - Nutrients.  Fertilizers may aid in the early stages.  Be sure to read the manufacturers label and instructions before application.
 - Mulch.  Applying mulch to the base of the tree aids in weeds suppression and moisture retention. 
 - Remove nearby weeds/plants.  Weeds and plants can provide competition to your tree for important resources.  Remove any near the root system of your tree.

The next most important thing in learning the guitar is to learn the correct way to hold the guitar.

The way you hold the guitar will affect your ability to play it correctly. If you hold the guitar wrong, you will be unable to play it at the speed of the music you are hearing. You will also be unable to play it correctly because your fingers will not be in the correct position.

Learning how to hold the guitar correctly is the first step in learning to play the guitar.

A good way to learn how to hold the guitar properly is to have someone give you a few tips and then try them out. Some hand positions for the right hand will be:

1. How to hold the guitar, using the fingers:

Place one or two fingers of each hand on the neck of the guitar, and then place the thumbs on the top of the guitar.

2. How to hold the guitar, using the thumb instead of the fingers:

Placing the thumb on the neck of the guitar, place the index finger of the left hand on the top of the guitar, then place the thumb on the back of the guitar.

3. How to hold the guitar, using the first finger of each hand:

"I want to get in better shape.  I work at a desk all day, and I've never really been in good shape.  Growing up, I didn't play sports or spend a lot of time outdoors.  I know I need to improve my physical health, but I really don't know how to get started.  Can you recommend a workout routine for me?"," or aerobics?  How about a new diet?  Any other advice?

A:

I think the answer to your question is really simple; just start.  There are countless fitness and dieting books out there that you can read up on.  Or, if you're feeling more adventurous you could try the weight room at your gym.  If you don't have a gym membership, you could do some research on the many websites that have free workouts you can do at home.
There are also many different ways you can get your body into shape, such as walking, jogging, aerobics, swimming, biking, etc.  Check out the site Yoga Journal for some ideas.  There's also Crossfit, which I have just started to do, and I have to admit that it's taking some getting used to, but it's fun and you can definitely get a workout out of it.
I would recommend just doing something different every day, for example:

Run 1 mile
Lift weights for 20 minutes
Do 10 pushups
Walk 2 miles
Do 2 pullups

Every day.  The only thing I would add is that I would recommend trying a new activity every day.  If you like jogging, then try swimming or biking.  If you like weight lifting, do some yoga.  If you like aerobic activities, try running the stairs.
Another thing that I have found that's really helped me is to mix up the workouts every day.  If you're doing the same thing every day, you're getting the same results.  So, try doing 3 different activities for 3 consecutive days instead of doing the same thing over and over.  That way you'll get a better variety of workouts, and you'll be able to see what you like and what you don't.

A:

A workout routine is a good start. I would suggest that you start out with 30 minutes of aerobic activity like walking, running, swimming, biking or riding a stationary bike, or some other aerobic exercise. As you progress, you may want to consider adding weight training and/or resistance training.
I would also suggest that you spend a couple of hours each week working out in the gym or at a track. You will get a good workout in a short period of time, and you will also learn how to exercise properly and safely.
As for diet, there are many different ways to get","Sure!  I can recommend a plan to help you get in shape.  To get started, consistency is key, so you do not want to overdo it and injure yourself.

For the third week, walk 30 minutes and start to do 3 sets of 5 wall push-ups each day.  Wall push-ups are push-ups against a wall, and you can make them easier or harder depending on how far from the wall you stand.  For the fourth week and beyond, increase your daily walk by 5 min, until you can consistently walk 60 min a day.  You should also increase the number of sets and repetitions of your wall push-ups until you",0.840279,0.999249,23.077226,0.990081,0.966068,5.37458,-4.741362571716309
Why did the chicken cross the playground?,"

Today's guest post comes from Clive Thompson, an associate editor at Wired and a regular contributor to the New York Times Magazine. He's known for his understanding of how the tech industry works, and he's a lot more optimistic about the future of the web than I am. You can follow him on Twitter at @clivethompson.

In the 1980s, the arcade was the hottest entertainment center in the world. Games were all the rage, and people paid to play them. The risk of getting caught playing a game at work seemed like it would be high, but I didn't think it would be that high. I had a part-time job at a local arcade, and one night, I got caught. I was working the register at the time, and I was cleaning up after a game when the owner came over and told me I was fired.

I was furious. I had always been proud that I had a job, and I didn't want to work at a place I didn't believe in anymore. I walked out of the arcade and immediately went to another part of town to see if there were any other jobs. I walked into a record shop, and the owner agreed to hire me on the spot. He knew I had just graduated from college and needed a job. He had me put together a portfolio of my work and came back the next day to give me a job. I worked there for a few years, and the owner would come in at nights to check on the place.

That's how I got my start in the video game industry. I was lucky. I had a job, and I was able to work at a place that was cool. I've worked in places where I wasn't lucky, and I've worked in places where there were good jobs, but no one cared about the games. I've worked in places where I was the only gamer, and I've worked in places where there were hundreds of gamers, but no one cared.

But the arcade was a special place. They were like a second home to me. I traveled to arcades in New York, New Jersey, and California to visit friends and play some games. Arcades are also where I met my wife. I was 22 years old, and she was very pregnant. I remember she had to go to the bathroom, so I took her to the bathroom, only to find that I had to go too. It was awkward, but",To get to the other slide!,0.391244,0.96845,0.526456,0.934013,0.458089,0.65565,-3.756791830062866

I will not be doing this for any of the short stories that are in HP and The Hobbit.

I will use a different color code for those books.

I love doing this. It's so exciting!

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

I will be posting the first entries of the color code in the next couple of days. If you are interested, I will start posting them a little bit at a time each day.

Oh, and I will be using the same color code for my blog header, as well.

I don't think I could do this if I tried. I have a serious case of bookstagram envy. I'm so glad you're doing this! I'm especially pleased that you're limiting your selections to the books you love. I'm sure I'd be overwhelmed by all the choices!

I'm glad to see you're doing this! I'm also glad to see you're thinking of not only the books but the movies. I've had a couple of people ask me about the movies as well and they're a big part of my HP collection. I'm thrilled that you're doing this! I've been wanting to start doing this for a while, but I haven't quite gotten around to it yet.

I really look forward to seeing your color coding as you go through the books, since you're not doing the short stories. I think I'll be able to follow along and get a real sense of what you're thinking about. That's a real plus!

You are doing a wonderful thing by doing this, Angie! I'm so happy for you! I don't think I could do any of this if I tried! I'm excited to see what you come up with! I will certainly be following along!

You are doing an amazing thing, Angie! I love seeing how you think about this and what you'll","Harry Potter

First is to hit the boundary, which can fetch either 4 or 6 runs. Second way is to run between the wickets and make as many runs as you can.

Who invented the game of basketball?,"

Who invented the game of basketball?

The first recorded evidence of a game of basketball was in Indiana in 1891. The game had grown from an early form of rounders, played by English schoolchildren, with the ball thrown into a ring, and the players trying to throw or head the ball through a hoop. By the mid-1880s, basketball had become a popular sport in the United States, and by the 1890s, it was played by the public schools in many states.

In the years that followed, basketball gained in popularity, especially among cities and towns. It had become one of the most popular sports in the United States by 1900. By the 1920s, however, the game had become too rough for the tastes of many, and it was banned in many schools by the 1920s. In the 1930s, the game became more popular again, and the popularity of the sport grew enormously in the 1950s and 1960s.

Basketball is played by two opposing teams of five players each. The players in each team are chosen by the referee. A team's offensive goal is to score more points than its opponent. The players on the team with the most points at the end of the game are the winners.

The game can be played by one or two teams, but generally it is played by two teams. Most games are played by four quarters, each quarter lasting approximately 10 minutes. In a game that lasts an entire half-hour, there are three quarters.

The referee is the official who calls the game. He also calls for time-outs, to stop play and give instructions, and to stop the game whenever a player is injured or is in danger of being injured. The referee is also responsible for making sure that players do not collide with each other.

The game of basketball has many similarities to football. The players on each team are divided into two groups: forwards and guards. The forwards score the points for the team. The guards defend the forwards by guarding them while they throw the ball into the hoop. The forwards are also responsible for passing the ball over the opposing team's net. The forwards are also responsible for running down the court and passing the ball to the guards.

In the early days of the game, the forwards wore shoulder pads, but they have been replaced by a small cup that is worn on the players' hips.

The game of basketball has many rules.

Some genes are regulated by negative feedback loops, which are common in prokaryotes. For example, the proteins CRP and OmpR bind to their own promoters. In this case, the binding of CRP to the CRP-CRP homodimer and to the CRP-OmpR heterodimer causes repression of CRP expression and derepression of OmpR expression.

What is the most common air or gas mixture used in recreational scuba diving.,"?

A:

Recreational scuba diving is done with air, or compressed air, and this is the type of gas mixture used in recreational scuba diving.
You can't dive with Nitrox, because the mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is not compatible with a mask.
You can dive with compressed air, but it's not really the same as diving with a mixture of air and oxygen. Compressed air is usually stored in cylinders and cylinders are not designed for use in scuba diving and are not very comfortable to use.

Can visual acuity be improved after a second ROP screen?
To evaluate the effect of a second screening on the low vision of infants with a previous screen detected retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) to determine whether this affects the number of infants requiring an additional ROP screen. A retrospective analysis was performed on infants who had a first ROP screen at <34 weeks' gestation and a second ROP screen at <36 weeks' gestation. A control group was selected for each patient by matching for gestational age at first screen and birthweight. The main outcome measure was the proportion of infants who had a third screen. The secondary outcome measure was the number of infants who required an additional ROP screen. Twenty-six infants with a first ROP screen at <34 weeks' gestation had a second ROP screen at <36 weeks' gestation. The mean birthweight of the control group was significantly higher than that of the second ROP screen group (P < .0001), and there was a significant difference in gestational age at first screen between the two groups (P < .0001). The proportion of infants who required an additional ROP screen was significantly higher in the second ROP screen group (P = .001). Infants with a first ROP screen at <34 weeks' gestation had a significantly higher proportion of infants who required an additional ROP screen after a second ROP screen than did infants in the control group matched for gestational age at first screen and birthweight. The increased rate of infants requiring a third ROP screen in the second screen group may be due to a lack of adequate follow-up. Further studies are required to determine whether a third screen is necessary in all cases of a second ROP screen.Tag Archives: Gummy Bears

List the colors of the rainbow,".

The rainbow's colors are listed in the chart below:

A rainbow is formed when light bends as it passes between raindrops. When light passes through a raindrop, it bends toward the surface of the droplet. The light continues to bend toward the center of the droplet. When the light bends back toward the surface of the droplet, it passes though a different type of raindrop. This allows the light to continue on its way. This is why a rainbow is seen in the sky.

What is the main benefit of the fianchetto in chess openings?,"ie.com

The fianchetto is not just a step to create space, but it is also important to note that it is a step to the development of the center. It is a good move to make whenever you notice a weakness on the side of your opponent's king. Even if you are in the center, you should not be in a hurry to develop your centerpiece. If you can use a piece to threaten the enemy king, then you should do so, but you should not be in the position of having to develop your centerpiece. One of the things that you should watch for is an opportunity to develop your centerpiece, so that it can become a threat.

How does the fianchetto apply to the Chess960 System?

The fianchetto is a very good move to use in the Chess960 System! Since a new centerpiece is always introduced, it is important to have a stable center. The fianchetto will give you more strength in the center, as well as making it easier to create a new centerpiece.

How does the fianchetto apply to the 1.e4 openings?

The fianchetto is also a good move to use when playing the 1.e4 openings. The fianchetto is a very strong move in the King's Indian and King's Gambit variations, but it is also a good move in the Slav Defense and Classical Variations.

Has the fianchetto been considered a good move for Black in the Sicilian Defense?

The fianchetto has been found to be a good move for Black in the Sicilian Defense. It is a good move because it is a development move, as well as a way to develop the center.

Has the fianchetto been considered a good move for White in the Sicilian Defense?

The fianchetto has been found to be a good move for White in the Sicilian Defense. It is a good move because it is a development move, as well as a way to develop the center.

What is the fianchetto?

The fianchetto is a move that can be made in the opening. It is a move that is made in order to open up the center. It is a very strong move that can be made in the main lines of the Sicilian Defense, the Caro-Kann Defense and the Slav Defense.

Why should I use EKS over ECS?,".

A:

ECS is a managed Kubernetes service.
It's managed by AWS.  
They run it, they update it, they monitor it.
This is VERY different to EKS, which is managed by the Kubernetes community.  
If you want to use EKS, you have to run it yourself, and you have to monitor it yourself.
If you want the convenience of AWS managed services, you can use ECS.

A:

Kubernetes (K8s) is a cluster management system and Docker (Docker) is a container management system. They are two different things.
K8s is a system to manage multiple cluster nodes. You can control your nodes using command line (kubectl), Elasticsearch, Prometheus, Gravatar, Cloudwatch, etc.
Docker is a system to manage multiple containers on a single node. You can control your pods using command line (kubectl, docker-compose, etc).
AWS EKS is a managed Kubernetes Service. It is managed by AWS. The service is responsible for creating and managing your Kubernetes cluster nodes, service nodes and pods. You can manage your nodes using command line (kubectl, kops, etc).
You can use EKS to deploy your Docker containers.
There is no way to use EKS to deploy your Kubernetes nodes.
I think you are confused about the two things.
If you want to deploy Kubernetes nodes, go with kops.
If you want to deploy your Docker containers on your Kubernetes cluster, go with Kubernetes.
Kops is a tool to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
Kubernetes is a tool to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
Kops is a tool to deploy your Kubernetes cluster nodes.
Kubernetes is a tool to manage your Kubernetes clusters.
Kubernetes is a tool to deploy your Docker containers.

A:

There are a few different services that make up Kubernetes:

Kubernetes Engine
Kubernetes Container Service
Kubernetes Engine Service

Each of these services has its own feature set and different ways to deploy and manage clusters.
Kubernetes Engine is a managed service by AWS.  Kubernetes Engine is designed to be used by large organizations with many different teams and a large number of developers.  It is designed for high security and is integrated with AWS network resources.
Kubernetes Container Service is a managed Kubernetes service.  It is designed to be","EKS enables a greater degree of portability and reduces lock-in risks, as compared to ECS.

What does the distribution of isobars indicate?,"s.

The Isobaric Surface Area (ISSA) and the Isobaric Area in Volume (ISAV) are useful metrics for evaluating the distribution of isobars in a mixture. ISSA is the surface area of the region defined by a fixed number of contours in the 3D X-Y-Z coordinate system. It is defined as the projected area of the boundaries of the bounding box of the sample. The Isobaric Area in Volume (ISAV) is the surface area of the region defined by a fixed number of isobars in the same 3D X-Y-Z coordinate system. It is defined as the projected area of the contours of the isobars.

In the plot below, the ISSA (red) and ISAV (black) values are shown for each of the components of the mixture. The ISSA and ISAV are calculated using the same values of the principal components (in the order of magnitude of the six principal components) used to define the mixture model. The ISSA values are all positive and the magnitude of ISSA is smaller than the magnitude of ISAV. This means that the isobars are distributed in the mixture in a relatively smooth fashion that is not strongly clumped together. This is consistent with the results of most of the principal component analyses performed in this tutorial.

What does the distribution of isobars indicate?

The distribution of isobars indicates that the components of the mixture have similar amounts of fat, but different amounts of water. The water is distributed in the mixture in a relatively more diffuse fashion than the fat. This is consistent with the results of most of the principal component analyses performed in this tutorial.

Note that the principal components of a mixture have a relatively large amount of overlap. This is a consequence of the fact that principal components are calculated based on the covariance matrix of the data. The covariance matrix is not symmetric and therefore the principal components are not orthogonal to each other. This means that the principal components of a mixture are not orthogonal to each other.

Example: A mixture is formed by mixing two components A and B. The components are treated as components of a mixture and the principal components of the data are calculated. The two components are isobaric and have the same ISSA and ISAV. The ISSA and ISAV values of the two components are shown in the table below.

In Iowa City, the state’s capital, demonstrators chanted “no justice, no peace” and “this is what democracy looks like” as they marched through the city.

In Chicago, several hundred people marched through the streets with signs reading ‘We are all Mollie Tibbetts’ and ‘I am Mollie Tibbetts.’

The protests were also held in at least 15 other cities and towns in the state including Cedar Rapids.

The demonstrations come after police arrested an undocumented immigrant for allegedly killing Tibbetts in a cornfield on July 18. The teenager was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and is currently in custody.

The man was picked up after a police officer noticed his car and then spotted him in a field nearby. He was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder.

The police officer who spotted the suspect was also shocked to discover that he did not have a driver’s licence.

Tibbetts was reported missing on July 18 after she had gone jogging near her home in Brooklyn, Iowa.

Police said she was jogging when she was attacked by a man in a dark-coloured truck. She was found the next morning in a cornfield by an agriculture worker.

‘A cowardly, vile, horrible person’

In a statement, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said Tibbetts’ murder was “an horrific tragedy that should never have happened.”

Reynolds said that she was “horrified to know” that the suspect was undocumented.

“This individual is a cowardly, vile, horrible person,” the governor said.

Give me some examples of igneous rocks.,".com

I work with igneous rocks in my job and I’ve only ever found one on the web (in a peer-reviewed journal, no less). I’m sure this is picked up by Google, but I think that’s a very small number of hits. A few more examples of igneous rocks would be great.

I also think we should be using the term “proterozoic” instead of “primitive”.

I’m not sure why you are so obsessed with igneous rocks, but I have to ask: why do you care what I think?

I’m going to say this in the nicest way possible: your (and others’) obsession with igneous rocks is, well, a little silly.

The other day, I was thinking about some of the cool features I’d like to see in a new version of Google Earth. I have also been thinking a lot about the current version of Google Earth—its problems, its strengths, and the ways it can be improved.

Since I’m writing from my home office, I’ve been using my laptop, which means that I’ve been a lot more aware of my environment than I usually am. I’ve been noticing a lot of things about the current version of Google Earth that I find to be pretty annoying.

I also know that the flaws I’m talking about are things that other people also find annoying. But I’m more frustrated with the current version of Google Earth than I am with any other Earth application, because it is my current day-to-day workhorse.

I have a lot of questions about the current version of Google Earth, but I don’t have very many answers. So I’m just going to make up some questions and post them here. Then we can discuss them, and I’ll try to answer them as best I can.

1. How about an option to view the Earth as a globe, with the time zones represented as lines on the surface of the Earth?

2. Why can’t we zoom in any farther than the current zoom level?

3. Why can’t we zoom out any farther than the current zoom level?

4. Why can’t we rotate the image?

5. Why can’t we pan the image?

Should I buy a tesla model 3 or tesla model y?,"s

I am considering buying a Tesla model 3 or tesla model y. Which one would be better for me? I am looking at buying a model 3 because it is cheaper than the model y and it also has a bigger battery.

Staff Answer

The Model Y is less expensive, but the Model 3 has a better range and is the more fun to drive.

If you need a car for daily commuting, then the Model 3 is probably a better choice. The Model Y is more expensive than the Model 3, so you will have to give up some features to get the Model Y.

The Model Y offers a longer range, better driving dynamics, and a more premium feel because it has a higher level of interior materials and features. The Model 3 is the more affordable option, but it will be more than adequate for many people.

The Tesla Model 3 has a range of 215 miles (346 km) under the EPA rating, while the Model Y has a range of 250 miles (402 km). The Model 3 is available with the Performance Package with a range of 300 miles (483 km), while the Model Y is not available with a Performance Package.

The Model 3 has a higher level of interior materials and finishes than the Model Y. The Model Y has a more premium feel because the leather seats of the Model Y are more supple than the Model 3, and the Model Y has a higher level of interior wood trim.

The Model Y has a more premium look, but the Model 3 has more interior features available. The Model Y has a panoramic sunroof, and the Model 3 does not. The Model Y has front and rear ventilated seats, while the Model 3 does not.

The Model Y has more interior leather and more amenities, including a larger touchscreen display screen, a larger 12.3-inch panoramic sunroof, a larger rear camera, and more interior wood trim.

The Model Y has a longer range, but the Model 3 is the more fun to drive. The Model Y has a higher level of interior materials and finishes, with a more premium feel, and the Model 3 has a higher level of interior features.

The Model Y has a longer range, better driving dynamics, and a more premium feel because it has a higher level of interior materials and features. The Model 3 is the more affordable option, but it will be more than adequate for many people.

The Tesla Model 3 has","It comes down to what your family needs are at end of the day! Model Y has more leg space, more height and good luggage space compared to model 3.

Where did Father's Day originate?,"a

I don't know the answer to this, but I do know what it isn't:

It isn't Mother's Day.

It isn't Father's Day.

It isn't even Boy's Day, which is more of a myth than a real holiday.

It is, in fact, April Fool's Day.

And like many other April Fool's Day traditions, it's not a day that is celebrated.

What is it?

Well, the origin of April Fool's Day may not be clear.

Some believe it all began in France.

There, on March 31, 1564, King Francis I decreed the celebration of April Fools' Day in his court.

As a prank, the French court would hide objects, like chairs and food, in the court's gardens, and then, when the king or his guests arrived, they would find the objects.

As a result, April Fools' Day was born in France, but not in the United States.

The concept of April Fools' Day might have started in the United States, though, when in 1683 the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Sir Edmund Andros, tried to convince the royal officials to stop celebrating what they called Mother's Day.

In the United States, Mother's Day was celebrated on the second Sunday in May in honor of the mother of Christ.

Andros suggested that they celebrate Father's Day instead, since it was also on a Sunday and he felt it should be observed just as Mother's Day had been.

Andros was sent to England to find Queen Anne, who agreed to make the change.

In England, the first Father's Day was celebrated in June.

But in the United States, the celebration didn't really catch on until the late 1800s, when the United States celebrated its Centennial.

The celebration of the United States Centennial in 1876 was called Father's Day.

And it was celebrated, at least in some cities, for the last time on June 21, 1876.

In the United States, Father's Day has been a day to honor fathers ever since.

Today, Father's Day is celebrated in many countries.

Here in the United States, we call it Father's Day, though it is also known as the Feast of the Fathers and the Feast of St. Joseph","Father's Day was founded in Spokane, Washington.",0.054774,0.993058,19.255012,0.954826,0.066681,4.26487,-5.820335388183594

Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky",0.889862,0.995631,22.829527,0.998003,0.89535,5.321674,-3.675004720687866

Chapter 2 – A Brief Introduction to Greek Mythology

The Greek Gods: A Brief Introduction

The Greek Gods are the most ancient of all the deities of the world. The Greeks believed that the gods had created everything that exists, including the people, the earth and the sky. Such power and intelligence, they attributed to the gods. They considered the gods to be the source of all good and evil.

The Titans were the most powerful and most intelligent of the gods, and they were jealous of the other gods. In order to make their power absolute, they tried to overthrow Zeus. Zeus was furious and had them imprisoned in Tartarus, a place of eternal darkness.

The Greeks believed that the immortal gods were unhappy with the state of things, and decided to make changes to the world. They decided that Zeus should be king of the gods, and they made him the ruler of all things. Zeus married his sister Hera, and had many children, including Heracles. The gods were unhappy with this outcome, and they decided to punish the children of Zeus and Hera. They decided to make the first child of Zeus and Hera, Rhea, pregnant, and when she gave birth to Zeus, she was forced to hide him. Rhea hid him in a cave, which was called Lyceum. When Zeus was old enough to find his way back to his parents, he found his way into the cave","cornucopia, wheat-ears, the winged serpent, the lotus staff",0.579829,0.980304,18.423978,0.989091,0.593938,4.313428,-4.892172336578369

What is sourdough bread?," that it is a naturally fermented bread, made by soaking and fermenting the flour in water and salt. It’s full of complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats that make it a good source of energy and nutrition.

While sourdough bread is naturally high in nutrients, it’s also low in calories and carbohydrates. It’s usually eaten as a quick meal that’s enjoyed with a side of cheese or nut butter.

Differences between breads

Bread is a staple food in the Western world, and there are many types of bread out there. But they all have some similarities. Bread is made from wheat, wheat flour, yeast, water, and salt.

In the case of sourdough bread, you will get the best flavor if you use a combination of flour and water.

How to make sourdough bread

There are two ways to make sourdough bread. You can either use a sourdough starter or you can use a “sourdough mother”.

The sourdough starter is more complex and requires more work. You’ll need to feed it flour and water regularly, and you’ll have to let it ferment for some time before you can make bread.

The sourdough mother is easier to use. You can make bread with this using a natural starter that you can buy or make at home.

It’s the best way to get started with sourdough bread. You can buy a sourdough starter at most health food stores, or make one at home.

How to make an sourdough starter at home

You will need:

flour

water

salt

sugar

Add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of sugar.

Step 2: Let the mixture rest

Cover the bowl with a cloth and leave it in a warm place for 12 to 24 hours. This will let the yeast in the flour start to ferment. The yeast will release carbon dioxide and alcohol, which","Sourdough bread does not use yeast to rise. Instead it uses a starter, which is fermented dough, as its rising agent. Hence it is classified as a naturally leavened bread. It normally takes longer for a sourdough bread to rise. Sourdough bread is more flavourful than normal bread. 

The starter is created using flour, salt and water. It has to be ""fed"" and maintained with fresh flour for the starter to remain alive. Staters can be stored in a cooler environment in order to slow down the fermentation prices.",0.344936,0.994698,23.404829,0.96171,0.411471,5.223529,-6.0190558433532715

How to get all children of a div

    <div id=""id2""></div>
</div>

I need to get all children of the div.
I tried:
$('#id1').children('.id2');

But it didn't work.

A:

You need to parse the element first:
$('#id1 > .id2').each(function() {
    // do something
});

Also, if you need to select all .id2 elements within #id1, don't use children(), use parents():
$('#id1 > .id2').parents('#id1');

The child selector is a descendant selector, not an ancestor selector.
You need to use the parent selector:

For the last few years, we have had a lot of trouble with the washing machine in our apartment. We had a new one installed and the first time we used it, it wouldn’t turn on. So instead of a new machine, we decided to buy a new one. We called a repair man, but he wanted to charge $300 to install a new one. We decided to try our hand at fixing it ourselves, and it was quite easy! We bought some parts from Home Depot and we were able to fix it ourselves.

Our appliance was a regular top-mount washer, and it was difficult to determine whether the problem was the washer or the drain hose. So, we decided to buy new parts and try it out. We managed to get the machine to start, and then the water would come out. We put in a new washer and one of the old drain hoses and the problem was solved. We did have to buy the new hoses, but they were only $10 a piece.

If you think your washer is not working properly, you can try fixing it yourself. You can try to drain the water. Also, try to clean out the drain hose and look for any cracks on the washer. If you don’t fix it, it will start to smell bad and will need to be replaced.

The total number of points scored, points per game played, field-goal percentage, and points per game allowed are all variables used to determine a team's record.

How does a team's record relate to wins and losses?

But does a team's record mean they will win or lose the game? The answer is yes and no. The team's record is not always a good indicator of how the team will do in the upcoming sports season.

Team Statistics

A team's record is not always a good indicator of how well they will do in the upcoming sports season. Sometimes a team's record indicates how well they will do during the first half of the season, but then the team plays better after that.

The team went 65-17 during the first half of the season and then went 24-10 in the second half of the season. The reason Cleveland's record decreased after the second half of the season was because the Cavaliers played against weaker opponents. The Cavaliers played well against teams that finished between sixth and ninth in the Eastern Conference, but they played poorly against teams that finished in the top five.

If you're a girl, there are ways to earn money on the side. I know a girl who's an artist and she makes money on the side when she's not teaching. There are also ways to earn money on the side if you're a man.

If you have an interest in a particular subject or topic, you can make money from it. You can freelance, do design, or do anything where you can make money from your expertise and knowledge.

There are ways to earn money on the side. You can get a part time job. You can be an amateur photographer or a hobbyist. You can do anything where you can make money from it.

If you have a talent for something like singing or dancing, you can do shows and earn money. You could also do craft shows or sell arts and crafts online. The possibilities are endless.

I'm a guy and I work at a company that makes a product that I'm a part of. When I'm not working, I go to school. I'm studying to be an Industrial Engineer. I like my job. I like what I do and I'm good at it. I make $30,000 a year.

The 38 match season extends from August to May, during which each of 20 teams play a home and away match against each of the other teams. A win earns a team 3 points, a draw is 1 point, and a loss is 0 points. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins. Unlike American sports, there are no playoffs to determine a champion. The 3 teams with the least points are relegated to the second level of English football, The Championship.

The mammals are the ones that we can see, and the amphibians are the ones that can't.

As a matter of fact, this is not true. The mammals do not include all the mammals known. The mammals are a subset of a larger group, the tetrapods – all four-footed animals. The amphibians are a subset of a larger group, the tetrapods – all four-footed animals.

Introduction {#Sec1}
============

The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in the availability and use of mobile phones worldwide. While mobile phone use has been linked to increased health risks, the exact nature of these risks remains unclear. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 2 billion people worldwide use mobile phones \[[@CR1]\].

A large number of studies have investigated the association between mobile phone use and cancer \[[@CR2]--[@CR4]\]. However, most of these studies have focused on the use of mobile phone calls, while the use of mobile phones as a data source has received much less attention.

Mobile phone providers in most countries offer data services with varying degrees of confidentiality. For example, in Finland, mobile phone companies store call logs for a maximum of three months, with all call data being deleted after six months. In contrast, in Poland, mobile phone companies store call logs for a maximum of two years and all call data is deleted after three years. In comparison, in Sweden, mobile phone companies store call logs for a maximum of five years and all call data is deleted after seven years.

We used the Finnish Mobile Phone (FMP) register, which contains information on mobile phone users, to investigate the association between mobile phone use and cancer. The FMP register is the largest and most comprehensive publicly available population-based register containing data on mobile phone use in Finland.

Essay on the health care debate

Check out the Vocabulary section on the left for definitions of the words used in this essay. The argument for the importance of health care is that it is a basic human right, and that it is a human right that everyone should have access to. This view was expressed by President Obama in his 2010 State of the Union address, where he argued that health care is a human right, and that everyone should have access to health care. This view was echoed by the Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficiencies in Health Care, which concluded that health care is a fundamental human right, and that the United States should provide universal access to health care.

The health care debate is a debate about the need for health care, and whether it should be provided by the government or by private businesses. It is a debate about who should pay for health care, and how much they should pay. It is a debate about who should have access to health care, and whether they should have access to private or public health care. The debate is about which health care system is best for the American people. The debate has been around for several decades; though, the debate has intensified in the last few years.

It is important to understand what the debate is about, and to know the definitions of the words used in the debate. The debate is about the need for the government to provide health care. It is about the need for the government to provide health care to people who are not able to afford health care. It is about the need for the government to provide health care to people who are unable to access health care from a physician. It is about the need for the government to provide health care to people who are unable to access health care from a private business. It is about the need for the government to provide health care to people who are unable to access health care from private health insurance.

The debate is about the need for the government to provide health care to people who are not able to afford health care.

"Given this paragraph about Pharaohs, when the title used to address the kings of egypt"," in the morning, the Pharaoh would take the children of Israel and put them to work in the brickyard. After a couple of days, he would call everyone together and say to them, ‘Why don’t you stop? I have not given you permission to work in the brickyard. That is your work. Consider yourselves my slaves and work for me.’ That is how the children of Israel were to work in the brickyard.

I am planning to visit South India in February. I am primarily interested in the coastal parts (Kanyakumari, Kovalam, Varkala, Auroville, Pondicherry, Mahabalipuram, Mamallapuram and Thiruvottiyur). I would be staying for 6-7 days. I will be travelling by train from Chennai to Trivandrum.

I would like to have a few water based soups, dosas (rice and legumes). I would also like to have a variety of spicy food.

The curry would be a bit of a challenge as I have not been eating it for a long time.

What is a grocery store?,"way

The nation’s biggest grocery store is looking to cut down on food waste, as it figures out how to use its stores’ massive amounts of food.

Trader Joe’s stores in the San Francisco Bay Area, which sell fresh and gourmet foods, including meat and seafood, have been recycling food since the mid-2000s, including expired and surplus food, according to its website.

Now, Trader Joe’s is testing the recycling of perishables. The idea is to reduce the amount of food that goes to the waste bin.

The test started last week in one store in San Francisco’s Mission district.

The grocery chain is taking a U-turn on its controversial decision earlier this year to stop offering plastic bags in its stores.

The move came after a massive public backlash and pressure from the Trump administration.

The company has also been criticized for paying its workers low wages.

Nearly 80 percent of Trader Joe’s workers are women and 67 percent are people of color, according to a report by the National Employment Law Project and the National Employment Lawyers Association, which both advocate for low-wage workers.

The company has also been criticized for the environmental impact of its stores.

In 2016, the company was the third-largest garbage polluter in the Bay Area, according to the San Francisco public health agency.

Trader Joe’s has a long history of being “green,” according to its website.

But the company has also been criticized for its environmental impact.

The company is constantly trying to reduce waste, said one of the company’s spokesmen, Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

“We’re always looking for ways to reduce our carbon footprint,” he said. “But we have to do it in a way that’s easy for our guests to understand, and not in a way that disrupts our guests.”

Trader Joe’s has over 400 stores in the United States and Canada and is the largest specialty food retailer in the nation, with sales of about $8.5 billion, according to its website.

The company started in 1960 as a single store in Marin County, Calif. The company was founded by Joseph C","A grocery store is a place that offers food and beverages to people for purchase.

Please list down some key points  regarding governance system of Portland from the given text,".

I am looking for a specific answer on governance system of Portland.
I am not looking for comparative answer.

A:

Portland is a Special District under Oregon law.  Special Districts are subject to the requirements of the Oregon Government Code.  
The key requirement is an elected board, which must have a majority of votes.  The board is required to create an annual budget, which must be approved by a majority of the voters.  Other than that, there are no other requirements.
The only other requirement is a requirement that the board make a plan for infrastructure improvements.  This plan is required to be approved by the voters.  The plan must be for a period of time of no less than 5 years.  It cannot be for a period of less than 5 years.  
The plan must be approved by a majority of the voters.  If the board does not follow the plan, the plan must be approved a second time.  
Additionally, the board must create an annual operations plan.  This is required to be approved by the voters.

Airplane Incident

Airplane Incident is a 1956 British Empire thriller film, and the first in a long-running series of films produced by Hammer Films. It was Hammer's first colour film, and the first film to be filmed in Technicolor. The plot concerns the disappearance of a crew member on a commercial flight and the efforts of detectives to find him.

A novelisation of the film was written by Colin Wilson.

Plot
The story begins with a crew member, McBride, being killed in a mid-air collision. Police believe he may have been the victim of a mysterious plane crash, but the plane was reported to have been found at the bottom of the ocean. Up until this point, there have been no leads to the identity of the killer, but the investigation is being hampered by the efforts of an eccentric detective called Slade.

McBride's wife, Barbara, is convinced that the crash was actually caused by a plane, and is determined to find out the truth. As the investigation continues, a number of other passengers are killed with strange, unexplained causes, and Barbara, who had been ‘forgotten’ on a remote island, makes a mysterious discovery.

We have investigated the kinetics of the photodissociation of the azide anion, N3-, by imaging the time-resolved dissociation of N3- at the C(2v) symmetry axis in a supersonic expansion. The dissociation is initiated with a laser pulse at a photolysis wavelength of 379.2 nm with a pulse duration of 50 fs. The dissociation proceeds via two pathways, which are designated as pathway 1 and pathway 2. The pathway 1 is the photodissociation of the N-N bond, N3-, to yield the N-N bond-containing fragment, ND3, and the N3- anion. The pathway 2 is the dissociation of the N-N bond, N3-, to yield the N3- anion and the N-N bond-containing fragment, ND. The time-resolved images of the N3- anions were observed with two-photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The observed dissociation times of N3- are 2.09 ± 0.02 ps and 2.57 ± 0.04 ps for pathway 1 and pathway 2, respectively, which are assigned to dissociation of the N-N bonds in the N3- anion. The dissociation rate of N3- is 40.1 ± 5.3 MHz, which is assigned to the dissociation of the N-N bond in the N3- anion. The mechanism of the photodissociation of N3- is discussed based on the observed dissociation times and the kinetic isotope effect.We will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday this Thursday, November 23rd, and Friday, November 24th.

They say it is special being a grandparent for a variety of reasons.  One very popular reason is they feel great pride in seeing their children grow into adulthood and take on the responsibility of having children. A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, ""I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.""

What are the unethical behaviors in the corporate world? Illustrate with an example.,"o.com/unethical-behaviors-corporate-world-7861514.html

In this article, I will discuss some of the unethical behaviors in the corporate world that might not be common to the world of business.

The unethical behaviors in the corporate world are not new, We have heard about it in the news or seen it in some movies. However, there are still many people who are not aware of what really happens.

The most common unethical behaviors in the corporate world are:

Dishonest acts

Lying

Inflated claims

Dangerous acts

Gossiping

Unethical acts

Dishonest acts

Dishonesty is the act of cheating or deceiving. It is one of the most common unethical behaviors in the corporate world. The people who commit this act are called “Dishonest.”

For example, if a person does not tell the truth, he or she is dishonest. The person who is dishonest does not believe in the truth or honesty. He or she will tell lies to achieve his or her goals.

Lying

Lying is the act of telling lies. The person who tells lies is called “Liar,” or “Liars.”

The people who commit this act are called “Liar.” For example, if a person says that he will meet you at the appointed time, but he does not do so, he is a liar.

Inflated claims

Inflated claims are made by someone who talks more than what he or she knows. A person who says that he or she has an excellent ability in a specific field or area is called an “Inflated Claimer.”

Dangerous acts

Dangerous acts are the actions that may result in harm to others. Some examples of dangerous acts are speeding, driving on the wrong side of the road, and others.

Gossiping

Gossiping is a type of unethical behavior that goes against the corporate world. It is the act of talking about others besides the ones that you think they are talking about them.

For example, if a person says bad things about his or her colleague, he or she is a gossip. This act causes trouble for the people who do not know about it.

Unethical acts

Unethical acts are acts that go against the rules of the","Boeing 737 Max 

 
Boeing is an American multinational company that manufactures aircraft, military equipment, rockets, missiles, and telecommunication equipment. The Boeing 737 series aircraft is the most popular commercial jet in the world. In March 2019 and December 2020, the Boeing 737 Max commercial jets belonging to Ethiopian and LION Air crashed, grounding the 737 Max jets. These incidents triggered the crisis at Boeing. 

The Boeing 737 Max crisis is a classic example of chained unethical behaviors exhibited by an organization and how one unethical behavior quickly led to another in an attempt to cover up the previous one. 

Motivated blindness 

Motivated blindness was the initial cause for the people involved in the 737 Max jet design. It started with Boeing’s chief technical test pilot, David Forkner, who repeatedly spotted erratic behavior on the jets MCAS (Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System). Despite egregious MCAS, David later urged FAA (Federal Aviation Authority) to remove the MCAS mentioned from the 737 Max instruction manual. Boeing management failed to overlook David ForKner’s and other faults and chose to",0.035219,0.997758,15.326682,0.918962,0.041301,3.463985,-7.4413557052612305
How do I open a pomegranate without exploding?,".com/home/how-do-i-open-a-pomegranate-without-exploding
I'm trying to build an LED matrix display, using the PWM method to drive it. I use a PIC18F2220 microcontroller, and am using the MPLAB IDE.
I'm using an Arduino Mega2560 as my controller, and am actually using the Arduino IDE itself to program the PIC. I have connected the PIC's data pin to the Arduino's digital pin 0, and its clock pin to the Arduino's digital pin 13. The PIC is receiving data from the Arduino -- and it's correctly displaying the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
However, I'm having some trouble getting the display to reverse. The code I'm using is:
void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    while (!Serial) {} // wait for serial port to connect
}

void loop() {
    int val = 255-digitalRead(13);
    int bit = digitalRead(0);
    analogWrite(0, val);
    digitalWrite(13, bit);
    delay(10);

When I turn on the display, the numbers go from 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. and then reverse. I want the display to start off with all 0s, and then reverse when all 7 numbers have been displayed.
How can I do this?

A:

I would assume this is because the Arduino sends the start bit first and then all the data. 
So the first cycle the data is sent: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
The Arduino then sends the start bit as 0, and you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Then you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Then you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Then you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Then you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
Then you have 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,","The trick is to open the pomegranate in a bowl of water. This way, the water will contain any bursts of juice from the pomegranate seeds.",0.040305,0.997051,2.718244,0.968096,0.032299,0.951199,-6.9755167961120605
What is the difference between the right and left side of the brain?,"c

A:

Both sides of the brain are critical for our daily lives.  The left side controls movement, the right controls speech.  The problem with strokes is that they affect the part of the brain that controls speech.  From what I understand, if you have a stroke on the left side of your brain, it will affect the right side of your body.  To put it another way, if you have a stroke on the right side of your brain it will affect the left side of your body.  In the case of a stroke on the left side, you may say something that you may not have said before.  In the case of a stroke on the right side, you may say something that you didn't mean to say.  
So, the left side of your brain controls movements and the right controls speech.  The right side of your brain controls speech and the left controls movements.

A:

The right side of the brain controls speech.
The left side controls movements.
The brain controls us.

A:

In conclusion: it is impossible to say what is the difference between the left and the right side of the brain. One can't tell if you are left or right brained by looking at you.

4.3","The lateralization of brain function is the tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other. The median longitudinal fissure separates the human brain into two distinct cerebral hemispheres, connected by the corpus callosum. Although the macrostructure of the two hemispheres appears to be almost identical, different composition of neuronal networks allows for specialized function that is different in each hemisphere.

Lateralization of brain structures is based on general trends expressed in healthy patients; however, there are numerous counterexamples to each generalization. Each human's brain develops differently, leading to unique lateralization in individuals. This is different from specialization, as lateralization refers only to the function of one structure divided between two hemispheres. Specialization is much easier to observe as a trend, since it has a stronger anthropological history.

The best example of an established lateralization is that of Broca's and Wernicke's areas, where both are often found exclusively on the left hemisphere. Function lateralization, such as semantics, intonation, accentuation, and prosody, has since been called into question and largely been found to have",0.167981,0.997938,14.260066,0.99009,0.156597,3.314535,-7.567319393157959

The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders).

How to give a good presentation?,", How to give a good presentation?

A:

The answer to this is to take your time and just present.  Think about who you are presenting to, what you want to say, and how to say it.  Then, go through and practice your presentation.  There are some things you can do to be prepared:

Ask a friend or colleague to watch you so that you can get their feedback.  Feedback is important for confidence.
Practice.  Maybe you should think about what you want to talk about first, maybe you should think about an example that relates.
Use a recorder.  A recorder makes it easier to review what you have heard.  Use a recorder and then review what you have said.  Do you say the same thing every time?  Is there a different way you could say it?
Use notes.  It's important to remember what you want to say, but it's even more important for you to remember what you have said.  Use notes to write down what you want to say.  Practice with notes first.

If you do all of the above, then you will be well prepared for a good presentation.  If you just wing it, then you may ask for feedback, but you won't be as prepared.

A:

Practice!
You're likely to find that your presentation is a bit off if you haven't practiced. You'll have a lot of nervous energy that will make you feel like you're not prepared.
Practice
Practice your presentation. You can practice in front of a mirror or with a friend. You can practice in front of a video camera. You can practice on your phone, so you don't have to worry about interruptions during your presentation. 
Make sure you understand the material you are presenting.
Don't be afraid to use notes. I like to use a laptop or tablet to take notes, even if I don't use it to take notes during the presentation.
Practice a lot.
The more you practice, the better you'll be able to present.

A:

Practice is the key.
I personally use a combination of notes and re-watching my presentations to make sure I don't have any errors.
I also try to think of how I would answer the questions that might be asked during the presentation. (This is always the hardest part, but improves with practice).
The best part of","Any good presentations should be well-timed. The presenter should make eye contact with the audience. They should also make use of power pauses - count ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5"" - before moving on. It may sound awkward for you but silence can be immensely powerful for audience to absorb the message. Don't be afraid to be yourself on the stage. Be mindful of your body language on the stage. Don't pace like a lion and find your resting pose. The most important thing though, is to practice! Just as how you wouldn't show up to a swimming competition without ever practicing swimming, you wouldn't just stand on the stage and expect to be able to give a good presentation. Practice is key!",0.129062,0.987585,30.549802,0.897797,0.159418,6.544733,-5.559298038482666
Tell me some common options for losing weight," up to 10 pounds in one day.Also, do you recommend doing a calorie deficit or a calorie surplus? I was thinking of doing a deficit to lose 10 pounds, but I am afraid that I will end up gaining it back after the deficit is over.

Others have asked for this, and it is an excellent question. I have spent a lot of time on this site, and have had many people e-mail or phone me to ask about this topic.

I am not a doctor, but I have gone through a lot of information and research on this topic and have found that it is very difficult to lose weight permanently.

I would like to add one thing to what I have already said.

There are two sides to weight loss.

1. Weight loss necessary for health issues.

2. Weight loss to improve overall appearance.

I will explain each of these in turn.

Weight loss for health issues:For those of you who are in this weight loss group, I have great news. The loss of ten pounds in one day will not necessarily improve your health.

Yes, it is great to lose ten pounds in a day, but the health issues associated with obesity are very serious. To stay healthy, you have to lose weight slowly.

I have personally lost over 120 pounds, and have had zero health issues. I have lost weight for health reasons, but I have been able to maintain that weight for years.

I know that some of you who have lost ten pounds in a day, have health issues. I understand that, and I would like to give you some advice.

1. Take your time losing the weight.

2. Get a doctor to check your health again.

3. Make sure you are eating a healthy diet, and exercise regularly.

4. If you are eating healthy, and exercise regularly, then you are probably not going to gain the ten pounds back in a few weeks.

Weight loss for overall appearance:There are many people who have become obsessed with losing weight for appearance reasons.

This is not a good idea, because it can be very dangerous.

If you are obsessed with losing weight, then you should not be eating a healthy diet, and you should not be exercising. You should be eating junk food, and not exercising.

This will not improve your appearance. It will make you sick, and you will lose weight only to gain it back","Eat less, reduce carb intake, increase protein intake, do steady-state cardio, do HIIT, lift weights, take supplements.",0.506107,0.993987,26.800225,0.863887,0.53107,5.939055,-5.641418933868408
When did Arsenal first reach the first division? How many league titles did they win between 1989 and 2005 and how many FA cups? How many trophies in total for that period?,"vah

Posted 15 April 2014 - 07:51 AM

I'd say from 1989 to about 1992. On to the Premier League, 1994. Arsenal won the league in 1996 and the FA Cup in 2005.

I'm sure the league title means something different to you, but that's how I remember it.

I'm sorry to say that I don't remember any FA cups. I think that is because I wasn't born in '85.

That is because the FA Cup was the last trophy that Arsenal won before they won their first league title. If Arsenal did win the league in '89, it would have been a '90.

You say that Arsenal reached the Premier League in '94, but there's also a Wikipedia article that states that Arsenal entered the Premier League in '94, and it lists the following dates:

'93-94 : First season in the Premier League
'93-95 : First seasons in the FA Cup and FA Community Shield
'95-96 : First season in the FA Charity Shield
'96-97 : First season in the FA Cup
'97-98 : First season in the FA Charity Shield

Running Data profiling on data sets can answer simple questions such as how many nulls in the dataset, what are the different patterns of dates in the dataset etc. Profiling is typically done on the subset of data. Tools have limit on the amount of the row in the data set it can profile. These tools can also create visualization on the profiling results for easy understanding of the patterns.",0.094509,0.323572,19.604741,0.756616,0.074709,4.170829,-4.974989891052246

","The first thing to check is if your baby is hungry. It’s by far the most common reason they cry. You can tell if they’re hungry by lightly touching their cheek and seeing if they have a “rooting” reflex. This is where they open their mouth and turn towards your touch, as if they were looking for the source of food.

If they’re not hungry, they’re possibly tired. Babies can become over tired and cry and fuss, even when you are just trying to get them to sleep. If this is the case you’ll need to calm them down first, and then you can get them to sleep.

Finally sometimes babies just cry for no reason. Isn’t parenting fun?",0.711397,0.995252,28.495173,0.973638,0.751596,6.385411,-5.830043792724609

What is Cabernet Sauvignon?,"a

What is Cabernet Sauvignon?

Cabernet Sauvignon is a red wine grape varietal. It is a member of the Bordeaux wine producing regions and is mostly grown in France. It is an extremely important grape for varietal wines and has been used in blending for so many years. Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the grapes that give Bordeaux its signature style of wine.

The history of Cabernet Sauvignon goes back over two and a half centuries and it is believed that Cabernet Sauvignon was first brought to the Bordeaux region in the 17th century by the French Huguenots. Their belief was that the grape was a variety that could withstand the hot, dry climate of Bordeaux and the vineyard spread across the region. Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the main grapes that are used to make Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Malbec.

Cabernet Sauvignon grapes tend to ripen early and so they are harvested not long after the grapes are ready to be picked. They are picked green and then left to ferment in large wooden boxes. At this time the grapes release their juice into the wooden boxes. As they ferment the juice changes and becomes darker in color.

The grapes for Cabernet Sauvignon are picked when they are fully ripe and have a deep red color. When the grapes are picked they are pressed and then placed in wooden boxes. The juice is then stored in the same boxes until the wine is ready to be turned into wine.

At this time the color of the wine is still a deep red color and the wine is still very acidic and can easily be described as tart. It is then placed in barrels and allowed to mature for several years. The wine is then ready to be released into the market.

Cabernet Sauvignon is also used to make a white wine called Merlot. The Merlot grape is a cross-breed of Cabernet Sauvignon and the French white grape, Sauvignon Blanc. The result is a white wine that is very similar to a red wine. The Merlot grape is used to make wine in the Bordeaux region and is also used in many other wine producing regions.

Cabernet Sauvignon is also the grape used in making the famous Bordeaux wine blend called Château Laf",Cabernet Sauvignon (French: [kabɛʁnɛ soviɲɔ̃]) is one of the world's most widely recognized red wine grape varieties.,0.150827,0.989044,18.082368,0.973593,0.16537,4.07224,-4.301599025726318

Who were the major players in the Watergate conspiracy?,": 8721131

Who were the major players in the Watergate conspiracy?

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover played a central role in the Watergate scandal.

Hoover was paranoid and often wrong. But his paranoid fantasies nevertheless helped lead the FBI to break the back of the original Watergate scandal.

Hoover became convinced that the Democrats had the White House bugged. So he hired the best private wiretapping firm in the country, the G. Gordon Liddy Company (GGLC). The firm was run by G. Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent turned career criminal. The firm had been hired by the Nixon White House to break into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate.

When Liddy was not breaking into the Democratic headquarters, he was breaking into the homes of the Democrats.

In fact, the Watergate break-in and the subsequent cover-up was only a small part of a larger pattern of criminal behavior. The two major players were Liddy and his boss, John Mitchell, Nixon's attorney general.

Liddy and Mitchell had been involved in a similar break-in at the headquarters of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (Strike Force), headed by Senator Frank Church. In the course of the break-in, Liddy and his men had taken tape recordings of the committee's interviews with witnesses.

The committee immediately suspected that the White House was behind the break-in. When the committee staffers found Liddy's fingerprint on one of the tapes, they were convinced that the break-in was part of a White House scheme.

The two men, Mitchell and Liddy, not only agreed to break into the Democratic headquarters. They also agreed to break into the homes of the committee's Democratic staffers.

The break-in was supposed to be a ""dry run"" for the real break-in at the committee's headquarters. But the committee staffers were not told about the break-in at the headquarters. Instead, they were told the break-in at the committee's offices had been aimed at the committee's telephone, and a bug had been placed in the committee's phone.

Was the break-in at the committee's headquarters a dry run for the break-in at the committee's offices?

The answer is not clear. The committee staffers were not told about the break-in at the headquarters, and they are","The list begins with the President of the United States, Richard Nixon. John Dean served as the Counsel to the President, and was a lead witness whose testimony blew the case wide open, naming many top presidential aides as being closely involved. H.R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and John Mitchell were all senior members of the administration who resigned in disgraced and were convicted. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy played major roles in the Watergate break-in. 

A major figure in the conspiracy was Daniel Ellsberg, but not for any wrongdoing. Rather, he was a target of the Nixon White House, and an attempted burglary of his psychiatrist's office was just one of the illegal acts that the White House covered up.",0.119117,0.998991,17.921654,0.965773,0.067918,4.014691,-5.017554759979248
What was the first British instrumental to top the USA charts,"? The Blue Danube Waltz and the Crash Diet. The latter by the British band went on to achieve platinum status.The Blue Danube Waltz was the first to achieve the #1 spot in the US dance chart.

The song was written in the German waltz tradition, by Johann Strauss in 1814 and published in 1857. It is an orchestral waltz and is the original introduction to the waltz genre.

The Crash Diet was a widely popular diet food in the UK and Europe in the 1950s. This was the only product to reach the top spot in the USA in the 1950s.

Dance is such a great way to help shape our physical and mental wellbeing, and can be enjoyed by all ages and abilities.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating condition of high mortality and morbidity, despite the rapid advances in the management of aneurysms. The timely management of SAH is crucial to the survival of the patient. The prognosis of SAH is dependent upon the severity of the initial neurological deficits and the early response to treatment \[[@B2]\].

There are many factors that contribute to the outcome of patients with SAH. The size of the aneurysm is one of the most important factors affecting the outcome. The outcome of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is closely related to the initial neurological deficits \[[@B3]\]. The mortality rate of patients with SAH increases with the severity of the neurological deficits at the time of the initial presentation. In patients with aneurysmal SAH, the outcome is better if the initial neurological deficits are less severe and if the patient is able to maintain a good level of consciousness for the first 24 hours \[[@B4]\].

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a widely used tool for stratifying patients with SAH and evaluating neurological outcome based on the severity of the initial neurological deficits \[[@B5]\]. Various scoring systems have been developed for predicting the outcome of SAH. In recent years, a number of scoring systems have been developed to predict the outcome of SAH. The World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grading system is one of the most commonly used prognostic systems in patients with SAH \[[@B6], [@B7]\].

There are many other combinations and permutations of the pakhru and tchele. I’ll add more examples to this post as I think of them.

Pakhru and tchele can be played with more than one instrument at a time. You can play pakhru with a string instrument and tchele with a percussion instrument, for example.

I’ve played with a group of Kenong in Ghana and Kenya that played with pakhru and tchele. We had a percussionist playing Kenong, and a string player playing pakhru. And another string player playing tchele. It was a really cool experience.

www.chinesepen-dictionary","I argue that differences in outcomes of credit scoring constitute both a data issue and an algorithmic bias. Let’s first examine the bias in the dataset. I think of the model itself as a black box that generates outputs to fulfill certain objectives – in the case of credit scoring, the objective is the accuracy, recall, and precision of default risk predictions. The model at its untrained version does not discriminate against foreign workers, women, or young people: in fact, it does not conceive of these (socially constructed) labels the way humans do. Yet, the dataset that the model is trained on is fraught with socially constructed biases. For example, social norms cast women as incapable, foreign workers as untrustworthy, and young people as inexperienced, leading to higher unemployment rate and worse living conditions for these groups. Their resulting higher historical default likelihood stems less likely from the demographics-related differences in capability than from the vicious cycles generated by social stereotypes. Stereotypes render datasets biased, which in turns bias the algorithms: given the goal to maximize prediction accuracy, the model learns the “patterns” in",0.240243,0.054036,0.071244,0.5672,0.214412,0.229427,-13.867664337158203

As to the date of the 20th, I have no clue if it was the 20th or the 19th? - Well, it was the 19th, anyway.

But I do remember that it was the first time we had a new guy in our class. I like to think it was pretty fun to watch him struggle to understand our jokes and our way of life. It was a little bit awkward at first, but he got used to it over the next weeks.

We at least had to endure him for a couple of weeks, before he was moved to another module (I think it was a different one). But he was a great guy - always helpful and eager to learn.

I think he even came to our class on the evening of the 20th. It was the end of the day, so we had our class for the night - and I guess he just wanted to see how we were.

But the next day, he was gone. I don't think he came back to the university again.

We continued to work hard, and we were all a bit sad when he was not there anymore. But he was very helpful and friendly to us - and we all wished him the best of luck.

I'm not sure if the name of this blog is appropriate: I just thought that if you want to know about an article about an old-fashioned tool, you might want to read it. But it's not about a tool, it's about a car!

It is an article about a classic car rally - a rally made up of cars from all over the world.

The idea is that the rally is about celebrating the beauty of the cars, the beauty of the roads, and the beauty of the driving. And it is about finding new roads and new places.

But it's not just about driving. It's about driving over new roads - it's about exploring.

So I was actually excited when I learned that there is such a rally - and that it will be in my home town of Nuremberg, Germany.

I took a look at the website and saw that the rally is called ""The Drift Rally Germany"".

And so I thought that I would write to the organizers and ask if they would allow me to participate in this rally.

I was going to ask if I could drive one of the cars, or if I","• 1978 - the launch of the sculptural program that included the construction of seven contemporary fountains in Paris

How can I help a homeless person?," to another country and donate money to them?

A:

You can donate money to a charity that works with the homeless and similar situations.  You can also donate time doing things like helping clean up the streets (if you live in a busy city).
One of the easiest things to do, in my opinion, is to join a community organization that works with the homeless.  I live in a very large city, and we have a local organization called the Coalition for the Homeless.  They have a lot of programs that you can donate your time to, such as:

Going to soup kitchens for example
Helping transport people from shelter to shelter
Helping people with personal hygiene
Helping people with their pets (they have a pet library)
Helping people with their legal issues (if they have an immigration situation)
Helping people with their medical issues (if they have a medical problem)
Helping people with their financial issues (if they have a legal issue with their finances)

One thing I have done, is to help the homeless with their pets.  I help them get their animals healthy, and I help them with their medical and legal issues.  I feel like the homeless population is hurting, and I would like to help.
Another thing you could do is volunteer at a local shelter.  I volunteer at a local shelter, and I love it.  I help people get into the shelter, I help people get their pets into the shelter, I help people find clothes, I help people find food, I help people find jobs, I help people find housing, I help people find medical help, I help people find all sorts of things.  I get to meet new people, and I get to help people, and I feel like I have done something good.
You can also volunteer at a local soup kitchen.  I have done this, and I highly recommend it.  A soup kitchen is usually a place that has a lot of leftovers.  They feed it to people, and they help them by giving them things to do.  It's a lot of fun, and you meet a lot of people.  If you do volunteer at a soup kitchen, don't be afraid to ask people for whatever they can spare.  If they say no, then that's what you learn.  If they say yes, then you get to help.
One more thing you could do, is donate money to the Coalition for the Hom","There are lots of ways you can help a homeless person.

It was built for George Pullman as a place to produce the famous Pullman sleeping cars.The park was made a national monument by president Barack Obama on February 19, 2015. The district had its origins in the manufacturing plans and organization of the Pullman Company and became one of the most well-known company towns in the United States, as well as the scene of the violent 1894 Pullman strike.

"In a bingo game, which number is represented by the phrase “two little ducks”?","6

The answer, according to the rule book, is “two”.

But a game in the UK has been banned after “bums” were given up to £50,000 each, a court has heard.

The game – called “bums” – is a variation of bingo, where players pay for each letter they spell as they call out numbers.

This means that a letter such as “T” or “A” can be worth £500.

The game, which has been played in parts of the UK, has been blamed for “victims of bingo addiction and financial ruin”.

In a trial at the High Court in Glasgow, it is alleged that Scottish Bingo Halls Ltd and its directors committed criminal acts by promoting and hosting the bingo game.

They are alleged to have given “sexual favours” in return for protection, security and “other benefits”.

The court heard that the game was played in the Scottish Bingo Halls’ premises in Glasgow, the Bellahouston Bingo Hall and the Hillington Bingo Hall.

The players are accused of being members of a criminal organisation, there being “a group of people who have come together to play bingo in a way which is against the law”.

The trial continues.

The court was told that a group of players, whom the court has been told are known as the “Bumbers”, were said to have been “fleeing the authorities” and were looking for “a way to get out of the country”.

The court heard that after they arrived in the UK, they were offered accommodation by the “Bumbers”, who were then advised to train them to play bingo.

The court was told that the victim “B” – who cannot be named for legal reasons – was given money – described as “funds” – as a “payment” for training.

The court heard that “B” was then asked to provide sexual favours to his trainer – who was not identified – in return for training and protection.

The court heard that “B” was “exhausted” after providing those favours and was given money to go to a hotel and “sleep off” the sexual favours.

In the early hours of the morning, “B” was then told to go to the Bingo Hall where he was taught how to play bingo.

"Given the following paragraph about the nutrition profile of peanut butter, what minerals is peanut butter rich in?","en.l.peanutbutter.com

Yes, you can enjoy a delicious peanut butter sandwich or a quick snack with just 3 grams of sugar and 3 grams of fat. Peanut butter has been a staple in American cuisine for more than 50 years, so it’s no wonder it’s an American favorite.

Peanut butter has a rich nutty flavor and a creamy texture. It’s loaded with protein and healthy fat, and it’s a good source of the minerals phosphorus and magnesium. Peanut butter is one of the best sources of potassium in a food.

The nutrition facts for peanut butter are as follows:

Serving Size: 7 g

Calories: 150

Protein: 5 g

Fat: 9 g

Sodium: 10 mg

Carbs: 4 g

Fiber: 1 g

Sugar: 1 g

In addition to peanut butter’s high protein and fiber content, it’s a good source of vitamins B1, B2, and E, and it’s a good source of vitamins A, C, and D.

It’s also a good source of iron, magnesium, potassium, and zinc.

Manufactures sell many different varieties of peanut butter. Most peanut butter is a blend of peanut protein, other nuts, and oils.

If you’re looking for a peanut butter that’s low in fat and sugar, choose a peanut butter that’s only made with peanuts and salt. Some varieties of peanut butter can have up to 17 grams of fat per serving.

If you’re looking for a peanut butter with less sugar and fat, choose a peanut butter that’s made with peanuts and salt.

If you want to add something extra to your peanut butter, try a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Cinnamon is a good source of manganese.

If you’re looking to keep your peanut butter low in sugar and fat, consider choosing a peanut butter that’s made with peanuts and no added oils.

So, if you’re looking for a healthy snack, peanut butter is a good option.

I’m a huge fan of peanut butter, and I’m not alone. Peanut butter is a delicious, healthy food. It’s so good that it’s been a staple in American diets for more than 50 years.

How did early civilizations use dates and dried fruits?,"iate

A:

In addition to the answers posted by @the_kludge and @Mankhool, I'll note that the use of dates to determine the year is quite common throughout history, and varies by region.
In Greece, the first is of course used, and it seems to have been a very important one.  The Roman calendar, which was the standard in the Western world for the first couple of millennia of the common era, was based on leap years.  But the Romans used what we might call ""pure"" years (each year is divisible by four, but not necessarily by 400).  So a year that was a multiple of 400 was a leap year, but a year that was a multiple of 400 that was not a multiple of 400 was not a leap year.  (Dates that were not divisible by 400 were sometimes rounded up or down, depending on whether they fell on the last or the first day of the year.  But if they did not fall on the first or the last day of the year, they were considered to be in the same year, just that one year in the history of the Roman empire was sometimes considered to have had two or more years.  For example, the year 476 is sometimes called ""the year of the four emperors"" because it had four emperors, but was sometimes called ""the year of the two emperors"" in order to avoid confusion.)
The year 587 was a leap year, as was the year 751.  The year 813 was not a leap year.  So 751 and 813 were both leap years, but the year 813 was not divisible by 400.  This is the case today in some years, but not all years.  In some years, the year 751 is a leap year, and in some years, it isn't.  In some years, the year 813 is a leap year, and in some years, it isn't, and so on.  So the number of leap years makes for a very good indication of when a year was a leap year.
The number of years divisible by 400, however, tells you nothing about whether or not a year was a leap year.  For example, the year 1700, which was a leap year, is also the year 2000, which was not a leap year.  The year ending in ""00"" is not a leap year.  So the number of years div","Early civilizations used dates, date juice evaporated into syrup and raisins as sweeteners.

How to Write a","The Covid19 pandemic has changed the lives of all human beings, and has driven massive consumption of personal protective equipment worldwide. People have adapted to wearing face masks as a 'new normal'. At the same time, the disposal of biomedical waste is a major concern, especially in developing countries with limited resources. Biomedical waste includes used Rapid Antigen Tests, PCR Tests, used injections, and used masks. We have observed that people who use the test kits and masks at home, often fail to dispose them off properly. This is counter productive, as it poses the risk of aiding the virus' transmission, and can potentially be life threatening to others. Hospitals, too, produce a huge amount of waste and it is imperative they dispose it off properly following all norms. 

If not scientifically handled and disposed, it could cause serious risk not just to human health, but also pose a serious threat to terrestrial and marine ecosystems.

Based on the following passage what is alternating current affected by?,".

1. In a circle around the poles
2. In a circle around the poles but in a different direction
3. In a circle around the poles and using different voltage levels

Answer:

The system that uses alternating current is affected by the same type of voltage as a system that uses direct current.
In both systems, since the voltage is constantly changing, the current is constantly changing in both directions.

Alternating current is generated by a generator. The generator converts alternating current to direct current for use in an electrical system. The generator is a device that uses moving parts to produce a direct current as a by-product.

Alternating current is composed of two parts: phase and frequency. These two parts are important because they determine the kind of electrical equipment that can be used with alternating current.

Phase determines whether alternating current is positive or negative.

Frequency determines how quickly alternating current changes.

Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). The higher the frequency, the faster the alternating current changes. The lower the frequency, the slower the alternating current changes.

When alternating current is converted to direct current, the voltage is reduced along with the current flowing through it. The voltage is reduced by passing alternating current through a coil. The coil creates an electromagnetic field that acts as a transformer. The transformer changes the alternating current into direct current.

When voltage is reduced, the current is also reduced. The current is reduced by passing alternating current through a coil. The coil creates an electromagnetic field that acts as a transformer. The transformer changes alternating current into direct current.

A device called a rectifier converts direct current into alternating current.

A device called a filter removes alternating current from the alternating current.

An inverter changes alternating current into direct current.

The frequency of a system is the rate at which the alternating current changes. Frequency determines how much voltage and current are generated in the system. The higher the frequency, the more voltage and current are generated.

The voltage is also affected by frequency. The higher the frequency, the greater the voltage.

The phase of a system is the direction that alternating current flows through the system. The phase of a system determines whether alternating current is positive or negative.

A positive phase is used when the alternating current flows from positive to negative.

A negative phase is used when the alternating current flows from negative to positive.

The current flows in the opposite direction of the","Alternating current is affected by electrical properties that are not observed under steady state direct current, such as inductance and capacitance.

There are many good and useful books listed in the Bibliography section, and two of my favorites are:The Dude Who Came Back From The Dead (Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child) and The Monster of Florence (Tim Marquitz). They are both true ghost stories, and not just for teens. You will enjoy them.

Another great book to read is The Haunting of Hill House (Norton Juster). It is a classic, and is the basis for the movie. This book has nothing to do with ghosts, but I think it is a great book to read for anyone who loves supernatural mysteries.

I am currently working on a non-fiction book. It is a book about the supernatural, and is due out in 2015. It is about a group of people who believe they have been contacted by aliens. Please stay tuned for more information.

Another book that I have been working on is a fiction book about a paranormal team. It is the first book in a series. This book is a mystery, and it will follow the members of the first paranormal team as they work together to solve paranormal mysteries.

What is the oldest film set in ancient Egypt?,"

Answers

The oldest film set in ancient Egypt is the ancient Egyptian city of
Memphis. It was first filmed in 1915, then again under the direction of
Richard Fleischer, Herbert Wilcox, and Edwin S. Porter in 1919. The
movie is a silent film, and the filming locations are the best preserved
of all the ancient Egyptian sites. The movie was an important historic
event for both moviegoers and Egyptologists. The movie is also very
colorful and entertaining because it was filmed in the Egyptian
sunset-lit city with the Nile River in the background.

The movie was shot in 1907. It was originally a silent film but was
colorized in 1924. Its original title is ""The Story of the
Ivory-Browed Women."" It is a story set in ancient Egypt. In the
movie, a prince falls in love with a princess. However, both of them are
married to other people. The prince finds an old man who tells him the
secret of the princess. The prince goes after his love. The movie has
been screened in the United States many times and has won awards.

The movie was filmed in Egypt and was the first movie filmed in the
country. It was first filmed in 1922. It was the first time that a movie
was filmed in ancient Egypt. The movie was made by Emile Chautard and
Emile Loubet. Two of the most important scenes in the movie were filmed
in the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis. The movie was made during a
period when Egypt was a popular tourist destination. It is the first
movie filmed in ancient Egypt.

Interview with Markus Lerdorf on the Web 2.0 Platform

This is the third in a series of interviews with leading Internet and Web 2.0
developers. The first was with Jeremiah Grossman (Part I, Part II) and the
second was with Jan Lehnardt (Part II, Part III). The interviewer, Steve
Dower, is a former Forbes.com contributor.

Q: What do you see as the next big technological development in the
Internet?

A: I think it will be the interaction between people with similar interests
on the Internet and how that will help people to find information they need
and to interact with each other. We'll have a lot more information about
each other, but we won't have that in the same way that we have that
information about celebrities, politicians, and sports stars. The average
person will be the celebrity of the Internet.

Q: How is that different or similar to what people have done with
television in the past?

A: Well, people have always been interested in what other people are doing
and what they're interested in. Actually, the Internet is much more
intimate than television. The Internet is personal.

Q: How do you see the interaction between people on the Web as different
from the interaction on the Internet?

A: It's much more intimate. When I'm surfing the Web, I'm not looking for
information from a computer. I'm looking for information from other
people. That's why I'm here, and that's why I want to hang out with
people who are in the same boat.

It's a lot more intimate. They're not looking at you, they're looking at
something they really care about. It's not like television. It's a very
personal sort of interaction that people want to have.

Q: How is that different from e-mail?

A: I think e-mail is very personal too. I mean, you have a friend who sends
you a message and you reply to that message. But I think there's more of a
sense of community in e-mail. It's like a real-life conversation. On
the Internet, it's like a conversation among friends.

"Using this passage, extract all the years associated with the area.","ects the first six years of Moses's life:3:1–4:41:7:3–4:4:2:2–4:37:8:5–7

This passage, which contains the longest of the numbers of the years in Genesis, is the first to mention the time when Moses was born. Note that the Hebrew expression translated ""when"" is literally ""when he came to his mother's womb.""

**4:5** _Moses' mother was a woman named Zipporah._

Zipporah is a Canaanite woman (see note at 2:1) from the tribe of Simeon (see Ge 49:3). She is the same woman who later in the story is referred to as ""the wife of Reuel the Kenite"" (Ge 30:24). She is the one who is healed of a skin rash by a man who bears the Hebrew name of Jethro (Ge 25:20). She is the woman who helps the Hebrews pass through the Red Sea (Ex 14:21–22). Only later in the story is her name spelled ""Zipporah"" (Ex 2:15), but the name appears to be the same in the Hebrew Bible.

**4:6** _Jethro, a priest of Midian, was moving about in the wilderness._

Jethro is mentioned only here and in Exodus 18:1. He is the son of Horeb, the mountain where Moses and Aaron met after their exodus from Egypt. Jethro is the second of only two men who are mentioned by name in the book of Exodus. The first is Moses's father-in-law, Amram, and the other is Moses's father, Aaron. Although Jethro is mentioned only here, he is a significant character in Exodus.

Why is Steph Curry such a good basketball player?,".

A:

The answer is very simple. Steph Curry is good at basketball because he is the best basketball player in the world. 
There is really only one ingredient to being a good basketball player. That ingredient is talent. Talent is just a fancy term for what is already present in all humans. All humans have the ability to play basketball, all humans have the ability to make a basket, and all humans have the ability to make a free throw.
So if you ask me, if you just had the ability to play basketball, that would be enough. You don't need to know how to dribble, you don't need to know how to shoot, and you don't need to know how to block. You just need to have the ability to do those things.
However, humans are not born with that ability. They need to learn how to do those things. So what makes a good basketball player?
It is all about: learning. Learning how to dribble, learning how to shoot, and learning how to block.
In order to do that, you need to play basketball. So there is no sense in learning how to dribble, shoot, and block unless you are already good at it.
So what is the best way to learn how to dribble, how to shoot, and how to block? Practice.

A:

All the best basketball players are great at what they do because they don't stop practicing. You practice, you learn, you get better. It's that simple.
Steph Curry practices more than anyone I can think of. He releases the ball, runs, shoots, moves, dribbles and drives on a daily basis. As a result, he is one of the best players in the world.
The best basketball players aren't just good at what they do. They also practice.

Eating out:

1 – This one is a little different for me, I know I eat out 3-4 times a week (and it was higher before I got pregnant), but I don’t really cook, so I usually eat out with friends, which is great. I’ve been really, really good about sticking to my meal plans, but when it’s time to go out, I still want to have something to eat. I’ve decided to up my meal plan to around $100 a week. I’ve been sticking to 4 meals a day, and I’ve been sticking to really healthy meals, so I’m not really worried about the cost.

2 – I’ve started to cut back on dining out and eating out. Last week I went to dinner with a friend and had a ball. I know it’s not the healthiest choice, but I’ve already started to add it to my meal plan. It’s just one meal, but I still feel the need to have that “healthy” meal.

3 – I’ve been eating out a lot for breakfast lately! I’ve been making my own oatmeal and I really like it. I’m trying to keep my portions under 2/3 cup each. I’m so excited to have my own kitchen and be able to make my own breakfasts.

4 – I went with a friend and her family to the Zoo for the weekend. We spent a little more than we should have, but we had a great time.

5 – I’ve been eating out a lot for lunch, which I’m getting better at, but I still want to try to make lunch a little healthier.

6 – I’ll also be eating out for dinner once in a while, especially since I’m not a big breakfast eater.

7 – I’ve been eating out a lot for dinner, especially when we go out to eat with friends.

8 – I’ve been eating out less for dinner and am making my own dinner at least 5 days a week. It’s just been so easy to make my own dinner and eat at home!

9 – I’ve been eating out less at restaurants, but still going out a lot. I’m trying to keep my portions in check.

10 – I’ve been eating out less, but still going out for dinner once in","Eggs, milk, yogurt, bread, deli meat, cheese, spinach, apples, chicken breast, chocolate",0.162155,0.994524,17.107089,0.965106,0.182815,3.882338,-4.38588809967041

Why do people read books?," with the author's name?

When I was in college, I was told by a professor that reading is a waste of time. I took that to heart and stopped reading. But I do miss reading. I have a book I read on my Kindle and I like it.

What do you think about the following statement?

""Reading is good for you.""

My answer is no.

How about this statement?

""Reading is bad for you.""

My answer is no.

What is the difference between the two statements?

I think the difference is the word ""bad."" It's not a good idea to read if it's bad for you.

Another way to look at it is this: Do you want to read books that are good for you or can you think of books that are bad for you and make a good decision not to read them?

I think good books for me are those that excite my emotions. I get excited about reading history and biographies. What do you think?

If you were going to read a book that you really enjoyed, which book would be a good choice? What would you want to read?

I'd like to read books that are excellent. I'd like to read books by those who have done something noteworthy.

I read books that have helped me to see the world in a different light. Books about history, political science, and biology. I like to read books that are about the human condition. I like to read books that are about people in their environment.

I'd like to read books that make me laugh.

I guess that I read books that are good for me, even if they are bad for me.

Are there any books that you would not like to read? Why?

No. I think that there are some books that I would not like to read. I don't trust the author's ability to do a good job with the story. I doubt that the author is telling the truth.

Are there any books that you would like to read right now?

I'd like to read _The World of Ice and Fire_ by George R. R. Martin.

If you could read any book, which book would you read?

I'd like to read _The Pearl_ by Ernest Hemingway.

Cricket

Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players who take turns batting and bowling. The teams take turns to score runs, which are made by hitting the ball with the bat towards the other team’s wicket, or bowling it, in the hope of getting the other team out.

The game originated at the beginning of the 19th century in England and is a team sport played in many parts of the world. Many variations exist, the most notable of which is the version played in the Indian subcontinent, known as cricket.

Cricket is the world's most popular bat-and-ball game. It is played by people of all ages and abilities in all corners of the world by both males and females.

The game is also popular in the United Kingdom and Australia. Cricket is considered one of the most exciting sports in the world, and it has shaped the international image of many countries.

"Which of these are soccer players? Maradona, Joe Biden, Michelle Platini, John Terry, John Oliver, Mike Anderson, Steven Gerrard, Mo Salah, Obama, Michael Jordan",", and Messi? If you guessed Messi, you are correct!

The exercise was developed by researchers from the University of Exeter’s Human Movement Laboratory and the University of Queensland’s Centre for Sports and Exercise Psychology.

The researchers divided the soccer players into two groups. One group was asked to imagine themselves kicking the ball to a goal the size of a soccer ball, while the other group was asked to imagine themselves kicking the ball to a goal the size of a beach ball. They also asked the participants to imagine that they were playing against a team of 11 other players.

“The results showed that the participants, especially those who were given the beach-ball target, experienced greater psychological benefits when they imagined playing against a team of 11 rather than a single opposing player,” the researchers said. “This suggests that the psychological benefits of social comparison are greater when playing with other players than against a single opposing player.”

The researchers suggested that the boost in self-confidence that comes from playing with friends may be an advantage over those who only play against a single opposing player. The same psychological benefits also arise when playing against a team that is significantly larger than the participants’ own team.

“When we are playing against a team that is slightly larger than our own team, our need for self-confidence may outweigh our need to avoid embarrassment,” the researchers said. “However, when we are playing against a team that is considerably larger, our fear of embarrassment may outweigh our need for self-confidence.”

The researchers concluded that psychological benefits may not be experienced when playing against a single opposing player. “However, if we imagine ourselves playing against a team that we perceive is larger than our own team, then the benefit of having a teammate with similar attributes to us may outweigh the benefit of avoiding embarrassment,” the researchers said.

“The psychological benefits of social comparison may be particularly important when playing a team sport.”

The researchers said that future research should investigate whether the psychological benefits of social comparison are greater when playing with a single opposing player, or when playing against a team that is significantly larger than the participants’ own team.

“Soccer is a team game in which even the smallest mistake can have a major impact on the result. That is why it can be difficult to measure the psychological benefits of playing with a teammate,” the researchers said. “However, if we can understand the psychological benefits of social comparison and how they relate to the physical benefits of a team sport","Maradona, Michelle Platini, John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Mo Salah are soccer players.",0.521099,0.994272,10.616555,0.975995,0.479154,2.717415,-4.120669841766357

"Of NFL teams who have gone to the Super Bowl, how many have a win percentage of Super Bowls of at least 50%?","ley

Posted 20 February 2013 - 04:47 PM

I'm not sure if their win percentage is greater than 50% but I think its safe to say that its greater than 50% as they won in a Super Bowl.

The win percentage of all NFL teams who have gone to the Super Bowl, how many have a win percentage of Super Bowls of at least 50%?

We can use the following formula for this:

P(Wins) = (nWins / nTeams) * 100

nWins = the number of wins of teams who have gone to the Super Bowl (nTeams)

nTeams = the total number of teams in the league (N)

If we plug in the numbers from the question we get:

P(Wins) = (1 / N) * 100

P(Wins) = 100%

So there have been 100% of NFL teams who have gone to the Super Bowl and have won at least 1 Super Bowl.

The win percentage of all NFL teams who have gone to the Super Bowl, how many have a win percentage of Super Bowls of at least 50%?

1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to a system for mixing signals from a plurality of signal sources and, more particularly, to a system for mixing signals from a plurality of signal sources driven by a plurality of modulation techniques.
2. Description of the Prior Art
In order to transmit voice signals over long distances, it is common to convert the voice signal to a digital form and then modulate the digital signal onto a carrier for transmission over the communication channel. In satellite communication systems wherein information is transmitted from a ground station to a satellite and then retransmitted from the satellite to a ground station, it is common to modulate the information on a carrier using a series of sine wave signals generated by a set of sine wave generators. The sine wave generators typically comprise phase locked loop (PLL) circuits which produce sine wave signals that are phase locked to a reference signal. The reference signal is typically a periodic signal, such as a signal generated by a crystal oscillator. A crystal oscillator is a device that produces a periodic output signal whose frequency is a precise multiple of the frequency of a reference signal.
A crystal oscillator produces a periodic output signal which can be used to provide a reference signal. The crystal oscillator is typically driven by a reference signal which is a repeating periodic signal which is used to control the oscillation frequency of the crystal oscillator. The periodic signal is typically derived from a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which drives the crystal oscillator. In a typical system wherein the crystal oscillator provides the reference signal for the PLL, the frequency of the reference signal and the frequency of the output of the VCO are the same.
In a typical system, the PLL oscillator circuit receives one of the sine wave signals generated by the sine wave generators. The PLL","An adverb is a word that describes or modifies a verb, adjective or another adverb and will usually end with ""ly"", such as slowly, creatively or fully.

Kamba Ramayanam was written by," it. The Ramayanam brought together the three major epics of India, i.e., the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Bhagavad Gita. The Ramayanam was originally composed in Sanskrit before being translated into Tamil. The Ramayanam was translated into Tamil by the Tamil poet Kamban in the 13th century.

Hinduism is one of the major religions of India and it is an amalgamation of many religions. The religion was started by a ""monk"" called Adi Shankaracharya. It believes in one God and many Gods. Two of the major gods are Brahma and Vishnu. Brahma is the creator and Vishnu is the preserver. The other important gods in Hinduism are Shiva, Saraswati, Lakshmi and Ganesha.

Hinduism is a large religion and it is divided into several sub-divisions. These sub-divisions are called as ""Dharmas"". The Dharmas are: Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Smartism, Shaivism, Shramanic, etc. Some of these sub-divisions are very large.

Vaishnavism is a major sub-division of Hinduism and it is divided into two major branches, one of which is called Skanda, and the other is called Vallabha. The Skanda is the branch of Vaishnavism that is based on the ten incarnations of Vishnu, i.e., Krsna. Some of the Indian kings are believed to have been incarnations of Vishnu. Vallabha is the branch of Vaishnavism that is based on the life of the goddess Lakshmi.

Shaktism is the branch of Vaishnavism that is based on the worship of Shiva, the great God. Shaktism is the worship of Shiva as a woman, i.e., the Shakti. Some of the Indian scholars believe that Shakti is the ""mother"" of Shiva. Some other scholars believe that Shakti is the ""sister"" of Shiva. The Shakti is believed to be the great power of Shiva.

Shaivism is the branch of Vaishnavism that is based on the worship of the Goddess of the Shaiva sect. Some of the Indian scholars believe that the Goddess Parvati is the ""mother","Kamba Ramayanam was written by Kamba Ramanarayanan, a Tamil poet of the late 19th century. The book is an adaptation of the epic Ramayana from the Sanskrit text and focuses on the life of Lord Rama. It includes stories from his childhood and early life, as well as his journey to the Kingdom of Ayodhya and his return after the war with Ravana. The book is set in the backdrop of the South Indian landscape and includes stories of love, devotion and heroism.

### **Summary**

◾The difference between the ""burden of proof"" and the ""burden of evidence"" is","""March Madness"" was originally coined after a high school basketball tournament in Illinois dating back to 1908. Henry V. Porter wrote an essay titled ""March Madness"" in the Illinois Interscholastic in 1939 to commemorate the tournament. Other media outlets embraced the term as the tournament continued to sell out and thrive for decades. Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term ""March Madness"" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982. The phrase became synonymous with the tournament ever since. In 2010, the NCAA made it official and paid IHSA (The Illinois High School Association) $17.2M for the rights to the phrase, and began using the trademark in marketing materials, logos and other branding material. While only used for the men's tournament for decades, the NCAA only began using the phrase ""March Madness"" for the women's tournament in 2022.",0.506804,0.456598,14.962786,0.796636,0.544117,3.453388,-10.647676467895508

I’m not an avid film fan, and I’d never seen a Pitt-Scott collaboration, so this was a risk. I’m glad I took it.

There’s been a lot of hype surrounding the film since it premiered at Sundance, but most of it has been focused on its star power. Brad Pitt and David Scott are two of Hollywood’s most bankable actors, which made me skeptical. I’d never heard of either of them, and when I first saw their names in the credits, I thought they were a new addition to the movie.

I went into the film expecting it to be a typical Hollywood story of a movie star working with a small-time American company to produce a movie. But that’s not what I got. The production was huge, with hundreds of interviews and many more scenes of Pitt talking about the art of film-making. The company they worked with was mostly made up of veterans of the U.S. military. Pitt and Scott were on set from early on, to help guide the production, and were the ones who decided which scenes would be included in the film. But it wasn’t just a story of Pitt learning to make a movie. It was a story of Pitt and Scott learning to work together.

The film opens with Pitt and Scott in a motorcycle shop in Los Angeles, where they’re having issues with their exhaust system. The scene is a little awkward, because Pitt and Scott are strangers, and the shop owner is an unlikable jerk. But the scene also shows how the two men can work together, and how they can learn from each other. In one of the most powerful scenes of the film, Scott and Pitt interview a","O.J.: Made in America had 5 parts.

What are rare-earth materials,"?

Rare-earth materials are minerals that contain a small number of atoms of the element erbium. The rare-earth elements include ytterbium, neodymium, and praseodymium.

Aren't all rare-earth materials precious?

No. The rare-earth metals are not as rare as many people think. The four heavy rare-earth metals—the lanthanides—are found in small quantities in natural minerals. They are not typically found in ores or in large quantities in the earth's crust. Rare-earth metals are most plentiful in low-temperature metamorphic rocks.

What is the difference between light and heavy rare-earth metal ores?

The lighter rare-earth metals are less stable in their ores than the heavy rare-earth metals. The lighter rare-earth elements can be melted and fused in the furnace at temperatures of about 1,500°C (2,700°F). The heavier rare-earth metals can be melted at lower temperatures.

What is a lanthanide?

The lanthanide series of the elements includes the first four elements of the periodic table: lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium. The lanthanide elements are named for the region of France where they were first discovered. The first lanthanide element, lanthanum, was discovered in 1857. The other three elements in the series were found by scientists at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in the late 1800s.

What is a lutetium?

The lutetium series of the elements includes the first four elements of the periodic table: lutetium, hafnium, lawrencium, and curium. The lutetium elements were discovered in the 1940s. The other three elements of the series were discovered by scientists at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in the late 1900s.

What are the typical applications of rare-earth materials?

Rare-earth materials can be used in electricity transformers, magnets, light bulbs, and other electrical components. They can also be used in electronic devices including computers, cell phones, and flat-screen televisions. Rare-earth materials are also used in the production of catalysts for the chemical industry, the manufacture of magnets for motors and electric motors, and in the development","Although originally thought to be rare, many of the minerals are actually common in the Earth's crust.

which is better to use in C++, vector or static array?

I'm just starting to learn C++ in school and I'm having trouble understanding why one should use vector over static array (and when both are needed).
So far I've only seen vector used when you need to allocate memory for the items that you add to the vector.
But, what I don't understand is why one would use a vector over a static array.
What is the difference between the 2?
I'm just trying to understand the difference between the 2 and why one would use one over the other.

Static arrays are not bad. They are really useful when you don't need dynamic allocation.
You may want to read about a few third-party implementations of C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
Some of the implementations:

vector
slist
set

A:

I'll just do a quick overview over your 2 questions.

What is the difference between the 2?

The main difference is that arrays are initialized with default constructors. This means they have zero memory allocated for you.
std::vector is an array of objects. It may be resized.

I'm just trying to understand the difference between the 2 and why one would use one over the other.

When you create a vector you allocate memory for it, but you can change the size of it at any time. 
When you create an array you don't have this feature.

What are some examples of tasks performed by AI?,"it: What are some examples of tasks performed by AI?

A:

The simplest example is that of an agent that is in charge of a single task.
For example, a robot that is sent to the store to buy an item.

A:

Some examples I've come across:

Facial recognition - When I enter a room, I can just tell by facial recognition if there are any humans in it.
Predicting the weather - I'm in a room so I can tell you what the weather is like outside the window.
Handwriting recognition - I'm writing an email to you, I can just tell if it's from you.

A:

The basic problem of having a robot in the house is the following:

The robot is not doing anything useful.
The robot is doing something, but it is not what you want it to do.

For example a robot that just cleans the floor. How can you tell if it is cleaning correctly? If it's cleaning the right things (like the corners of the table) it is probably doing a good job. But if it is just cleaning any spot on the floor the robot is in fact doing nothing useful. The same could be done with the robot vacuum cleaner.

A:

As pointed out by others, the most basic is a robot that does housework - that is, cleaning and maintaining things.
But beyond that, you could have a robot that just picks up things and puts them into a location you want it in.  Perhaps you have a set of boxes and you want the robot to put them in the right place.  Or perhaps you want the robot to put them in the right place and the boxes are laying where you want them.
Or perhaps the robot knows where it is and where it is supposed to be putting things.
Or perhaps you want the robot to do the same kind of thing that a human does, but in a different setting.
In any of those cases, the robot is doing something, but it is not doing something you want it to do.
The most common problem with these kinds of robots is that they just do things they are told to do.

Running is the one thing that has been consistent in my life. It's like having
a job. I started when I was in my late 20s out of boredom and necessity,
working for a few years at various contracting companies and then going to
school. I'd say i'm not a particularly great runner, but I'm not at a point
where I'm considering quitting any time soon either. The only times I get out
of it is when I'm sick, in prison or otherwise occupied so I'm not sure if
it's a good idea to keep it up in that context.

I did get a bit overweight a while ago but that's probably down to other
factors and not running.

I’ve had a good running career. I’ve run many marathons and mtb races. In
addition to running I have a fairly high level of fitness. I like to hike and
bike and some swimming. I’ve got a few injuries but nothing too bad. I’ve
also been doing yoga for about 15 years.

The biggest problem I have with running is it makes me hungry, and the
typical post-run meal is one of the most mindless activities.

What is Christmas?,".com

The first Christmas was celebrated on December 25, the date on which the Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar, was born.

It was on December 25, 500, that the Roman Emperor, Constantine, changed the date of Christmas to that particular date. Some people have been confused about this change. For many years, the Roman churches still celebrated Christmas on December 25th. Those who were not Roman became confused and thought that the Roman Emperor changed the date of Christmas. Some people still argued that the Roman Emperor did not change the date; but, the Roman Emperor gave the date of Christmas to the Roman Christians.

The date of Christmas was changed to December 25 because the pagan Roman Emperor, Julius Caesar, claimed that the birth of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was the beginning of the rule of Christ, the King of Kings. Julius Caesar was the Roman Emperor. Therefore, it was necessary to change the date of Christ's birth to the day when the Roman Emperor ruled.

Christians and other people who do not believe in God, and do not believe in Jesus Christ, must obey God's commandments. But, if they do not obey God's commandments, they will be punished. They will not be able to go to Heaven. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for our sins to save us from going to Hell. He rose from the dead and He ascended to Heaven to become our Savior. God revealed to us that He is the only way to salvation.

When Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was born, He was born in Bethlehem, the city of David. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was the King of Kings, and He was the Lord of Lords. The angels and the sheep were singing to God the Father and to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the King of Kings, when He was born.

When the angels and the sheep sang to God the Father and to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the King of Kings, they were singing about the King who was born in Bethlehem.

When God the Father and Jesus Christ, the Son of God, talked with Abraham, Moses and David, the people who were born in the home of Abraham, Moses and David, they were talking about the King who was born in Bethlehem.

When the men and women who were alive during the time of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, were born, they were talking about","Christmas is a Christian holiday that represents when Jesus was born.  This holiday is celebrated on December 25 every year.  Church's will have a manger setup with figures showing what the birth of Christ would have looked like thousands of years ago.

How do you make Cincinnati style Venison Chili?," After we have the chilis in the pot, they need to simmer for 5-6 hours or until the meat falls off the bone. The chili starts out with onions and peppers, which are sautéed until brown and a little crispy. Then, we’ll add some beef in chunks, some tomatoes and spices. It’s good with onions and peppers and beans, but if you want a veggie chili add cauliflower and green beans. I love the way it smells in the kitchen while it’s cooking and the color it turns when it’s ready.

What's your favorite thing about Cincinnati?

You can’t beat the people. We’re a very friendly and welcoming community and that’s something you don’t see very often. I enjoy being a part of the Cincinnati community and I hope to continue to be a part of it for years to come.

What would you like to see in the future?

I’m not sure what the future holds for me, but I’m very excited to see what God has in store for me. I’d like to see Cincinnati continue to grow and see more people come to the city and experience it for themselves.

What advice would you give to someone visiting the city for the first time?

The first thing I would say is to check out the Cincinnatian.com website. There’s so much information on there. If you’re looking for a place to eat, the best way to find it is to use the website.

It's a really great book.

A:

The first thing I would do is to learn the basics of music theory, and you can do that by taking guitar lessons and playing the guitar. Once you understand the basics (like A, D, C, E, B, A, etc.), then you can learn to read music. That's the best way to learn, and you can get a lot of free lessons online from YouTube.
I also suggest reading ""The Art of Practical Composition"" by Paul Lansky - it's a great book about music theory. I've never used it, but I've heard from a few people that it's a great book.

A:

You can learn the basics of music theory online. I've found the following resources very helpful and they are great for beginners.

Q:

In Python, how do I test for a string contained in a list of string, but outside of an if statement

If I have something like this:
for i in range(5):
    if ""my_string"" in list:
        print(list[i])

How would I get the value of ""my_string"" if it is not contained in the list?

A:

You can use a list comprehension:
if ""my_string"" in [str(i) for i in range(5)]:
    print(i)

You can also use in to test if a string is contained in a list:
if ""my_string"" in list:
    print(list)

But if you are using an if statement then you","Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

"Tell me which of the following objects are shaped like spheres: beach ball, banana, pencil, marble, credit card.",".pl

A:

Hint: 

 The answer is all of them, except the credit card, which is not a sphere.

Reasoning:

 A beach ball is shaped like a sphere, but a sphere is not a sphere.  The pencil and the marble are not spheres, so are not covered.  The credit card is a card, not a sphere, so is not covered.  Therefore the answer is all of them.

A:

Your first condition (not a sphere) applies to the pencil, so the answer is:

banana

Your second condition (not a sphere) applies to the beach ball, so the answer is:

pencil

Your third condition (not a sphere) applies to the marble, so the answer is:

credit card

Your fourth condition (not a sphere) applies to the beach ball (you can't have a sphere which is not a sphere), so the answer is:

pencil

Your fifth condition (not a sphere) applies to the pencil, so the answer is:

credit card

Q:

How to disable WIFI or 3G connection from Android app in real time?

I want to disable the wifi and 3g connection when the connection is not available.
My code is:
ConnectivityManager conMgr = (ConnectivityManager) getSystemService(CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE);

if (!(conMgr.getNetworkInfo(ConnectivityManager.TYPE_MOBILE).isConnectedOrConnecting())) {
    // 3G or wifi is down
    // save the current time
    // do the action here
}

But the problem is that the connection is not available in the first time. It will take a while before the connection is available.
So I want to disable it while the connection is not available.
How can I do that?

A:

Check if the connection is currently available.
if(isWifiAvailable()){
    // do stuff
}else{
    // do stuff
}

What is measured on the Gay-Lussac scale,", or thermoelastic curve, is the amount of energy released per degree of temperature when a metal is bent in a certain fashion, or the amount of energy needed to bend the metal.

Significance of the Gay-Lussac scale

The Gay-Lussac scale is a useful tool in determining the melting point of a metal, and thus it is useful when molten metal is poured from a vessel.

A simple example is to take a metal, say tin, and immerse it in liquid mercury. The surface of the metal will begin to melt when the temperature of the mercury is approximately 910° Celsius. The original shape of the metal is recovered at 700° Celsius. This “melting point” is called the fluid-solid phase transition.

The Gay-Lussac scale is also useful at measuring the temperature of a nuclear fusion reactor. The temperature inside a fusion reactor is determined by how much energy the fuel contains. The temperature at which the fuel begins to melt is called the critical temperature. The Gay-Lussac scale can be used to determine the critical temperature.

The Gay-Lussac scale was invented by Jean-Victor Gay-Lussac (1778-1850). The scale was first published by Gay-Lussac in 1825 and soon after improved by Richard R. Straubel (1825-1898). This scale is named after him.

The Gay-Lussac scale is a logarithmic scale, where the value of K is governed by the Lambert-Beer law:

k = K0 ln(T/T0)

where k is the coefficient of thermal expansion, K0 is the coefficient of thermal expansion at reference temperature, T0, and T is the temperature of the material.

The coefficient of thermal expansion is a measure of the amount of change of length for a certain amount of change of temperature. For example, a metal that expands by a certain amount for every degree increase has the same value of the coefficient of thermal expansion as a metal that expands by a certain amount for every degree increase.

For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion of iron is about 23×10−6m/C. This means that if the temperature of iron is increased by one degree Celsius, its shape will change by approximately 23×10−6m.

The Gay-Lussac scale is a logarithmic scale, where the value of K is",Alcohol strength,0.368033,0.992137,12.163076,0.975262,0.507186,3.001139,-5.49458122253418

What's the best binding setup for ski touring?,"

I'm thinking of buying a pair of the first generation (e.g. La Sportiva X-King & La Sportiva X-King Pro) for ski touring but I'm not entirely sure on the best setup. I'm getting a pair of La Sportiva X-King Pro and I'm thinking of getting a pair of La Sportiva X-King first generation bindings.

Note that the La Sportiva X-King Pro uses the same hardware as the X-King so you will have the same features on the two bindings.

I'm not sure if the first generation bindings will work well with ski touring (i.e. the first generation bindings didn't have the same frame design as the second generation bindings). So, I'm wondering if I should get the second generation.

I'm not sure if the first generation bindings will work well with ski touring (i.e. the first generation bindings didn't have the same frame design as the second generation bindings). So, I'm wondering if I should get the second generation.

Just a couple of observations.

1) The X-King Pro is a progression of the X-King, it's not a completely new model.

2) The X-King Pro uses a slightly different type of binding with a slightly different spring system, they are very similar. Both use the same binding components, which gives you the option of swapping between the two.

3) The X-King Pro is a slightly higher end model with a slightly higher price tag.

4) The X-King Pro is generally considered to be a more ""serious"" binding for touring, the X-King first gen is more of a ""fun"" binding for touring.

5) The X-King Pro is likely to be compatible with the X-King 1st gen, but they are not compatible with each other.

I'd always recommend buying the first","It depends on the emphasis of ski touring.

Who is the NBA's all time leading scorer?,",' Bryon Russell, the league's all-time scoring leader, dies at age of 79 in Pasadena, California.He won't be alone.

Russell is the only player in NBA history to have played in more than 2,000 games.

Russell's career was only slowed by a 1948 season-long suspension for violating the league's anti-drug policy.

Russell's Hall of Fame career began at the age of 17 with the Minneapolis Lakers and he averaged a then-record 25.9 points per game for 11 seasons before a brief stint with the San Francisco Warriors in the early 1950s.

He returned to the Lakers, where he helped them win 11 championships, before retiring in 1960.

He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and the U.S. Basketball Writers Association Hall of Fame in 1982.

Russell played his last season in 1967-68 for the Lakers, on a team that included such future Hall of Famers as Gail Goodrich and Jerry West.

He averaged 23.1 points per game and was a key performer on a team that won the first two championships in the Lakers' Western Division dynasty.

Russell was named to the NBA's All-First Team in 1946 and 1947, when he averaged 25.9 points per game for the Lakers. He was named All-NBA First Team in 1947 and 1948.

He was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969 and was the first non-player to be so honored.

Russell was also a star player in the Harlem Globetrotters and was a member of the team when it won its first championship in 1950.

On June 9, 1947, Russell was suspended for violating the league's anti-drug policy, but he was allowed to continue playing for the Lakers. He was reinstated in 1954.

Russell played in 1,275 career games, scoring a career total of 25,932 points.

He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971 and the U.S. Basketball Writers Association Hall of Fame in 1982.

""How old is the Sun?""

I know that the earth is 4.6 billion years old. But I don't know how old the Sun is.

I know that the Earth and the Sun are orbiting each other. I also know that the Sun has fused hydrogen to form helium.

The Sun is a star. My textbook says that the Sun is 4.6 billion years old, but how do we know this?

Can you please give me a source?

Thank you.

AnswerThis is a good question. It is a combination of what you know, which is not much, and what you can find in the literature which is much more.

First, we know that the sun is 4.6 billion years old. This is a very good starting point. What the book does is to describe the history of the solar system: how the planets formed when the sun was young, how they evolved and how their orbits have changed over time. This description is based on observations and models.

How old is the sun?

The sun is 4.6 billion years old, but it has been in existence for at least 4.5 billion years. This is based on the fact that the earth is 4.5 billion years old. The earth is thought to have formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and it has been in existence for a long time. The sun is a star, and it has been in existence for a long time too. We know that all stars are formed from the same kinds of matter, and that the sun is no different. The sun formed out of a disk of gas and dust about 4.5 billion years ago. The disk of gas and dust is called the solar nebula. The nebula has a mass about 500 times that of the earth. The reason for its mass is that the nebula is still forming stars. If you look at a picture of the solar nebula, you will see that it has a small core of gas and dust, and a larger cloud of gas and dust around it. This is called an accretion disk. The gas and dust clouds around the nebula are held together by gravity.

Is it possible to show the date formatter in the success message when using Devise?

I want to show the date formatter in the success message.

A:

Looks like Devise uses the standard Rails Date formater to format the date.
You can override this behaviour by defining a custom date formatter:
config/initializers/devise.rb
Devise.setup do |config|
  config.date_formats = [:month_name, :day_name, :year_name]

  config.mailer_sender = 'devise@example.com'
  config.mailer_default_options = {
    config.date_formats = [:month_name, :day_name, :year_name]
  }
end

You can then use a custom formatter:
<%= f.date_field :date, :value => Date.today, :label => ""Date"", :input_html => { :class => 'date_field_with_js form-control' } %>

What are the reasons why quantum theory is considered do difficult to understand,"ive.

The measurement problem is a difficult problem, but the answers are worth understanding, if they are possible. Those answers are as follows:

1. Quantum theory is incomplete, as it has to be completed with various hidden variables.

2. Quantum theory is not a complete theory of reality.

3. Quantum theory is not a complete theory of information.

4. Quantum theory is not a complete theory of measurement.

The first reason is due to the fact that quantum theory does not describe the behavior of subatomic particles, but only of the probabilities of these particles to have certain definite positions and orientations in space. It is necessary to have a theory of the behavior of subatomic particles to obtain the answers to these questions.

The second reason is due to the fact that the theory of quantum physics is not a complete theory of reality. The most famous example is the EPR paradox. This paradox states that if we have a quantum mechanism that allows us to transmit a message instantaneously, then it is possible to send a message that is behind the other, since the message is sent instantaneously. This is impossible in classical physics, because there is no way of sending messages that are behind the other, unless you use a light beam (which is possible in classical physics, but not in quantum physics).

The third reason is due to the fact that quantum theory is not a complete theory of information. For example, in the famous experiment of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR), it is described that if a particle is entangled with a particle, then if you measure one of the entangled particles, it is possible that the other particle will be also measured. This phenomenon is called ""nonlocality."" In classical physics, entanglement does not occur, since it requires the simultaneous existence of two particles in the same space-time system.

The fourth reason is due to the fact that quantum theory does not describe the behavior of quantum measurement. We can deduce from the theory of quantum physics that any measurement must have an effect in the system, but we also know that quantum measurement also gives us the probability that the system will be in a certain state. It is not possible to say that the system will be in a particular state or not when we measure it. For example, the state of a protein molecule can be measured as ""inactive"" or ""active,"" but it is not possible to say that it will be in an ""active"" or ""inactive"" state","1. There is not one agreed set of basic rules (axioms) that underpin the theory and each has subtle implications on how you interpret the theory
2. For each of those there are multiple views and mathematical frameworks for describing the theory (e.g. the wave mechanics, field theories, etc)
3. The mathematical theories are all at an advanced level and few examples of how to actually apply them appear in text books.
4. The theory itself says that you cannot know the intermediate steps in any quantum process, you can know where you start and predict where you might end up but not how you get form one to the other.
5. The theory is based on either infinitely parallel actions occurring deterministically or statistical interpretation of a range of outcomes
6. All of these interactions occur without direct reference to space/time and so are in abstract spaces that need to be decided for the calculation and physically interpreted",0.000941,0.401539,19.357344,0.042726,0.000795,3.960669,-4.6972126960754395

How many people in total were killed or injured in this text?," is a little vague.

A:

The text is rather vague.
The conflict is estimated to have taken place in 200 BC, so it may have started as early as 130 BC or as late as 200 BC. The text is ambiguous, but it is known that it started in 200 BC.
It could be that the text is referring to a battle in which the Romans were victorious.

Q:

Quickly changing the text of a span with an image in it

I have a span with an image in it. When the user clicks a button, I want to change the text of that span to the text of a variable.
I've tried this:
var title = 'Hello';
$('#hello_button').click(function () {
    $('#hello_span').text(title);
});

But it doesn't work...

A:

The problem is because you're calling the function before the element is actually loaded.
You need to either bind to the click event or use the load event.
$('#hello_button').click(function () {
    $('#hello_span').text(title);
});

or
$('#hello_button').on('click', function() {
    $('#hello_span').text(title);
});

//OR
$('#hello_button').load(function() {
    $('#hello_span').text(title);
});

You can also use the jQuery load event as well:
//when an image is loaded
$('#hello_button').load(function() {
  //this is executed after the image is loaded
  $('#hello_span').text(title);
});

The load event is triggered when an image is finished loading, and is available on the document.

Introduction {#sec1_1}
============

The association between heavy drinking in men and risk of prostate cancer was first reported in 1976 \[[@B1]\]. The reason for this association is not known but it is thought that high levels of circulating androgens or their precursors may enhance the risk of prostate cancer \[[@B2]\]. Since then, several studies have supported this hypothesis \[[@B3], [@B4], [@B5], [@B6]\]. In our previous case-control study, we found that men with a history of heavy alcohol consumption had an increased prostate cancer risk \[[@B7]\]. In the present study, we investigated whether there was an association between alcohol consumption and prostate cancer risk among men from different ethnic groups.

Materials and Methods {#sec1_2}
=====================

The study population consisted of a total of 136 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the Stockholm-Gotland region between 1971 and 2001. The case group consisted of 116 men diagnosed in the Stockholm region, while 4 men were diagnosed in Gotland. The control group consisted of 120 men selected from the Stockholm region who were free of cancer at the time of the interview. The study was approved by the scientific committee of the Institute of Epidemiology at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, and all participants signed an informed consent.

The cases were selected among men from the Stockholm region who were diagnosed with prostate cancer during the period from 1971 to 2001. The inclusion criterion was that the patients had to be men of 50 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis. The exclusion criteria were: (1) patients with other cancer diagnoses prior","Italy, Brazil, Uruguay",0.224346,0.961974,6.706007,0.670548,0.159893,1.744554,-7.755420207977295
What type of diet does Dr. Michael Greger advocate for?," you’re craving to know, read on.

What are the benefits of a low-carbohydrate diet?

In this new study, Dr. Michael Greger, the author of the best-selling book How Not To Die and the founder of NutritionFacts.org, explains that a low-carb diet is a good option for anyone who is overweight or has type 2 diabetes. (For those who are not overweight, a low-carb diet may not be appropriate.)

The most compelling evidence for the benefits of a low-carb diet comes from the landmark study from the American Diabetes Association. This study compared a group of people who consumed a low-carb diet with a group who ate a high-carb diet. The study showed that the low-carb group lost more weight and had better blood sugar control than the high-carb group.

The low-carb diet is also related to improved cardiovascular health. A study published in the journal Circulation found that those who ate a low-carb diet had a lower risk of heart attack and stroke.

What is a low-carb diet?

A low-carb diet is a diet with a limited carbohydrate intake. A diet with a high carbohydrate intake is called a high-carb diet. A low-carb diet is also sometimes called a ketogenic diet.

Some people follow a low-carb diet because they want to lose weight. Other people follow a low-carb diet because they want to reduce their risk for type 2 diabetes.

What is the evidence for the benefits of a low-carb diet?

The evidence for the benefits of a low-carb diet comes from the landmark study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In this study, researchers compared a group of people who consumed a low-carb diet with a group who ate a high-carb diet.

Researchers found that the low-carb group lost more weight and had better blood sugar control than the high-carb group.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends a low-carb diet in people with type 2 diabetes. The American Heart Association also encourages people with type 2 diabetes to follow a low-carb diet.

These are just a few of the many reputable medical organizations that recommend a low-carb diet for people with type 2 diabetes.

Is the Cordyceps fungus from The Last of US real?,"?nly if i were to tell you that it lives in a spot.

There are many different types of Cordyceps fungus, and they can live in a variety of places. Some live in trees, others in soil, others as a parasite on ants or other insects, and some even live inside the bodies of animals. The fungus that the disc is from is one that is found in the Tibetan Himalayan Mountains region.

The Tibetan Cordyceps comes from a species called Cordyceps sinensis. This fungus can be grown in a lab, but for the purposes of the disc it is grown in a liquid culture. The species has been known to grow for about 900 years, but wasn’t discovered until the late 1800s.

The fungus grows in the soil of the Tibetan region, and is used for its medical applications. It has been used for the treatment of many different ailments, but has primarily been used to treat people with lung disease, and even cancer. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 1,200 years.

The disc is made of a resin, which is a type of plastic used to make discs. It is dyed in the traditional way, and the design is a blend of a traditional Tibetan Buddhist design and Indian patterns. The resin is expensive, but the production is quite simple and can be done by anyone.

There have been a few other similar, but different offerings from the region around the same time. There were two other Talking Buddha discs made in the same style, and one was made just a few months before the disc came out. There has also been a similar disc made in Africa.

There are a few different versions of the disc, but the most common versions have the Tibetan Buddhist iconography on the face, and the design on the back. Each version is different, and the versions that have been made are quite unique. Many have the number of the year it was made, and some have random designs on the back or the front.

The price of the disc can range from $70 to $200, depending on the variations that are made. The price is a bit high, but the disc is a fairly unique item that is unique and was made by a group of people who are passionate about the region and its culture. The disc can be found on Etsy, and is a great conversation piece.

The Talking Buddha is a unique, one of a kind, classic Tibetan","Yes, Cordyceps is a real fungus naturally occurring in nature. However, unlike its portrayal in the The Last of Us videogames and TV show adaptation by HBO it can not infect humans and is in fact often used in medicinal supplements and even eaten as food. The Cordyceps fungus does infect insects in real life, with ants and caterpillars being the most common hosts. The Cordyceps takes control of the motor functions of the host and eats the host from the inside.",0.542819,0.993809,11.864585,0.955585,0.60021,2.991402,-4.441437244415283

As you start to build your desired structure you start to take 1-3 or couple of handful of legos from the basket. As you start to give some shape to the structure you are designing you start to put back some of the legos into the basket you don't need. Overtime you keep changing the shape slightly here and there; sometimes making the structure smaller and sometimes a little bigger. And you are doing all of these from the lego collection in the basket of yours. Cloud computing in a similar way is compute power that you can rent out from a cloud provider who has huge data centers spread across the world (This is the basket).

beautiful in their own right.

The
Shy Plant is a collection of six different types of plants
that have been given a ""Shy"" treatment. Each plant
is lovingly hand crafted and finished to look like a typical
plant.

tribute to his mother, Bonnie, who loves all types of plants.
The collection was first shown in 1985 at the New York Botanical
Garden, and the Shy Plant quickly became a favorite with
plants enthusiasts.

and are often overlooked by gardeners.

six different types of plants in the Shy Plant collection
are:

Hinoki cypress

Hinoki larch

Cornus florida

Euphorbia characias

Hosta

Nandina

The
collection has a variety of sizes. The largest of the Shy
Plants is a large Hinoki cypress that is 3 feet tall. The
smaller Shy Plants range from 4 inches to a little over 1
foot.

In total how long was Winston Churchill the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.," seconds. I re read it. I think it’s full of lies and innuendo. I don’t think it’s an accurate reflection of him.

Hi Nick, I’ve just read your piece in today’s Guardian, and I couldn’t agree more with your comment about the 20th anniversary of the fight to free Kuwait. What struck a chord with me was the fact that it was the 21st of April, and I was born on the 22nd – thus I am a ‘shabbas goy’! I went to school with a lot of Israeli kids and was often mistaken for one, as they all looked very similar. I can’t say I’m very fond of them, but the fact that I have a Jewish background and a connection to Israel makes me very proud. Many of them are very gloomy people – not only about Israel, but also the world in general. I try to explain to them that a lot of people are suffering right now in the world and it’s not a very nice place, but from time to time I realise that they don’t care, and they’re happy to be in Israel and have their normal life.

I don’t know if you know the story of Uri Avnery, the Israeli writer, politician and peace activist. He was a soldier in the Israeli army for many years – apparently he saw a young Palestinian boy being beaten by an Israeli soldier, but didn’t do anything to stop it. I think this experience made him very angry, so he began to take part in demonstrations against the occupation. I was very moved by his speech at the commemoration of the liberation of Kuwait, and I think he has a point. He said that the West banks didn’t care until a few days ago what was happening in the world. I think we should all think about this – the West Bank and Gaza are very important to the rest of the world, but what is happening to the rest of the world is far more important to us.

Yours in peace,

I can't stand it when a person is so rude that they will not speak to you at all. I really don't care if it is a guy or a girl. I could not believe the woman's rudeness today when she said she was waiting for her husband to come pick her up before she could go play tennis. I was waiting for my husband to pick me up to go to the gym. It took me half an hour to get ready to exercise, and I was in and out of the gym in less than an hour. I could have been in and out of the gym in 15 minutes. I had to wait for the woman to get her husband in order to go. I would have been very upset if I had to wait for him. I was very glad to get to play tennis and run around after I got done. She was eyeing me all the time, and I was not even looking at her. She was really rude.

I had the same problem to a friend of mine. We played and I was at the courts for about two hours, which was longer than I had expected. I had to wait for her to get her husband. She was really rude and acted like she was in a hurry. I told her I would be here for five hours, but she said she didn't care. I was so upset that I ran home to get my tennis shoes and then played a match for two hours. I was so upset I almost cried, and I couldn't see straight for a while. I hope that this will be the last time for us to play. I have to have my tennis shoes because I have a tournament next week. I don't want to play her again and have to wait for her.

Hi. I had a similar experience. I was at a local tennis club for three hours. I was there to play with my son, and he had to get his mother for the first time. I was really upset. I was just so glad that I could play tennis without her there. I saw a woman playing with her husband, and she was really rude to me. She was complaining about the rules of the court. I told her that it was a public court and that I was waiting for my son to come and play with me. She said she didn't care. I just hope that that is the last time I will have to play with her.

abstract: 'We are interested in the generalised Poisson algebra $C^\infty(M)[[\lambda]]$, where $M$ is a smooth manifold, and $C^\infty(M)$ is the algebra of smooth functions on $M$. As a vector space $C^\infty(M)[[\lambda]]$ is a direct sum of the Poisson algebra $C^\infty(M)$ and an infinite series of non-commutative power series. In this paper we study the behaviour of the Poisson algebra $C^\infty(M)[[\lambda]]$ under the action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of vector fields on $M$ and the derivation $\delta$ of the algebra $C^\infty(M)$. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g}$ to be invariant. We also discuss a method of computing the invariant subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ using a representation of the algebra $C^\infty(M)[[\lambda]]$ as a power series in $\lambda$ and the derivation $\delta$.'

Why is a meme compared to a gene?,"

What is a meme, and why is it the new gene?

If you don’t know what a meme is, it’s because you’re not old enough to have seen it before!

A meme was first used by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene to describe a unit of cultural or biological information passed down from one individual to another. It is a unit of cultural information that gets passed down from one person to another by imitation, and is a unit of biological information passed down from one organism to another through genes.

If you think of a gene as a ‘blueprint’, then a meme is the ‘soul’ of a culture – a blueprint for culture. Genes are also the ‘blueprint’ for an individual, but a meme is the ‘soul’ of a species. (Memes are also often called ‘cultural viruses’ – a term coined by Richard Dawkins – so it’s important to remember that a gene is a ‘cultural virus’ too!)

Here’s a really simple example of a meme…

Meme is a unit of cultural information that gets passed down from one person to another by imitation, and is a unit of biological information passed down from one organism to another through genes.

Here’s an example of a virus, which is a unit of biological information passed down from one organism to another through genes:

The ‘soul’ of a virus is that it’s a unit of biological information that gets passed down from one organism to another through genes.

The ‘soul’ of memes is that it’s a unit of cultural information that gets passed down from one person to another by imitation.

Tell me a story," of your life.

– R. Gordon Wasson

Oscar Wilde once wrote in his diary:

This afternoon I had a long talk with my wife and she told me that she had been to see a certain actress, who had lately been in a play. I asked her what the play was. She said it was called Richard III. I said to her:

“Richard III, my dear, is the one man in the world who, if you paid him to behave, would behave as if he had never heard of you.”

"Tell me whether these objects float or sink in water: oil, leaves, boats, baseball, phone, coins",", etc etc etc.

I am not sure if my question is clear. I am not asking about the motion of the water. I am asking about the motion of the objects in the water. Can you please tell me the formula to calculate the speed of the objects in water.

May I know if this question is not difficult to answer. I will be very grateful if you give me some help.

I have not been able to find any formula for the speed of motion of an object in water. Would you please ask a question for the speed of motion of a body in water?

First of all, the speed of movement of an object in water is the speed of the object minus the speed of the water. The speed of the water is the speed of the object in water plus the speed of the object in water.

We can also try to keep the object in water as still as possible. If that is possible, then the speed of the water will be zero and the speed of the water will be the speed of the object in water.

The best way to get the speed of the object in water is to actually measure its speed.

If you are able to find a formula for the speed of an object in water, please post that formula here.

Sounds like you have a lot of balls in the air.

I'd recommend you take a step back and look at the big picture. It sounds like
you are putting a lot of pressure on yourself to try and do too much all at
once.

Ask yourself these questions:

1\. What do you want to achieve with this startup? What do you want it to do?

2\. How will you make this happen? How will you make this product a reality?

3\. How will you make this happen?

4\. What are the most important things you have to do to get this done?

5\. How will you do it?

What is a good score to shoot in golf?," is the difference between a good score and a bad score. The better your score, the more points you can earn on your handicap. The lower your score, the more points you can earn on your handicap.

The Golf Handicap System is based on a different system than the one used in the United States. In the United States, the handicap is determined by the difference between your total score and your final score. For example, if your total score was 100 and your final score was 200, your handicap would be +50.

In the Golf Handicap System, the handicap is determined by the difference between your handicap and your total score. If your handicap is 30 and your final score is 100, your handicap would be 15. The closer your final score is to your handicap, the better golf you are doing.

How is my handicap calculated?

Your handicap is based on the number of strokes you take to complete each hole of golf. The more strokes you take, the higher your handicap. Your handicap is determined by adding the number of strokes you take for each hole of golf.

For example, let’s say you take two strokes to complete the first hole, three strokes to complete the second hole, and four strokes to complete the third hole. Your total score would be 20, and your final score would be 100. Your handicap would be 15.

What if I have no idea of my handicap?

If you do not know your handicap, you can find the handicap for your score by using the Golf Handicap Calculator. The Golf Handicap Calculator is a free tool on our website.

What should I do if I do not like my handicap?

You can change your handicap when you are playing golf. Simply contact the golf professional at your course.

If you would like to keep your handicap the same from one course to the next, you can submit your handicap to our Golf Handicap System.

Explain gravity," laws of motion, and it is really that the law of gravity is that every object tends to fall to the ground because it has mass.

A:

The rest of the answer is very technical, but a simple answer is:

You should learn Newton's Laws of Motion, and then you can
  immediately appreciate the difference between the two.

Newton's Law of Gravity is a statement about the acceleration of a body as a function of its mass. It describes the acceleration caused by the weight of that body. To be precise, the weight of an object is the product of its mass and its acceleration wrt to the centre of gravity of the object when it is stationary.
Newton's Law of Inertia is a statement of the Law of Gravity for all bodies in motion. It's a statement about the inertia of a body (i.e. its tendency to continue to move at a constant speed and/or in a straight line).

A:

The difference between a body in uniform motion and a body in non-uniform motion is that the former has a force acting on it to change its speed.
The force acting on the object in uniform motion is equal and opposite to the force that caused it to accelerate.
Let's look at a body moving in a circle.  If the body has mass $m$ and radius $r$ and the centripetal force is $F$, then
$$F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
where $v$ is the magnitude of the speed of the body.
If the body is in uniform motion, it will be moving at a constant speed $v$, so
$$v = \sqrt{2 F r}$$
The acceleration of the body is then $a = dv/dt$ and we can solve for $v$ to get
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 F r}{m}} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{2 F r}{m}} t \right)$$
The time it takes for the body to complete one revolution is
$$t = \frac{2\pi r}{v}$$
Now, if we know the time it takes for the body to complete a full revolution, we can determine the speed of the body at that time.  Since the body is in uniform motion, the acceleration of the body is constant.  This means that the acceleration at that time is
$$a = \","Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.",0.125614,0.986104,14.454175,0.950657,0.193775,3.342065,-7.239328384399414
What is an Italian Greyhound?,". The dog is a cross between an Italian Greyhound and a small bloodhound. The Italian Greyhound’s coat is primarily white, but has some grey and black markings.

What is an Italian Greyhound?

The Italian Greyhound is a very large dog. The dog’s size is the reason why it is often nicknamed the Greyhound, as it is a greyhound who is supposed to be a greyhound. The dog’s size is a disadvantage for a dog who is hunting rabbits, but it is an advantage when hunting larger game such as deer. Also, the dog’s size is a disadvantage when competing in dog sports where the dog must run very fast. The dog’s size means that it cannot run as fast as a smaller dog, and that has led people to question whether the dog can even be used for dog sports.

However, the dog’s size is an advantage when the dog is used for police work. The dog’s size means that it can patrol large areas without getting tired. Also, the dog’s size means that it does not have to be close enough to the person it is looking for to be able to smell him or her.

The Italian Greyhound also has a long history of being used in hunting, and the dog’s size means that the dog can run for a long period of time. The long history of using the dog for hunting has meant that the dog has developed a high level of endurance. The dog’s endurance is also an advantage when the dog is being used for police work.

The Italian Greyhound also has a long history of having been used as a police dog. The dog’s history of being used as a police dog has meant that the dog has learned to obey commands, and that means that it can be used for police work. When the dog is used for police work, the dog will respond to commands from the officer it is working with. The dog’s obedience is also a benefit when the dog is being used for other jobs, such as tracking down a person who is missing.

The Italian Greyhound is a medium size dog. The dog is a medium size dog, as the dog’s size is around 60 pounds, but the dog’s size means that it is still large enough to be able to hunt rabbits. The dog is good at hunting rabbits, and the dog’s size means that it can be","Italian greyhounds are small dogs resembling racing greyhounds but are much smaller at around 15 pounds.

Which component of a PV solar system implements MPPT?,"

A. MPPT controller
B. Inverter
C. Bridge
D. Batteries

A:

It depends on the type of solar panel array being used.

For systems that are using strings of panels, MPPT is performed by the inverter, which is a special type of AC-DC converter that can change the voltage of the current drawn from the panels under load by opening or closing extra switches. 

MPPT control units are used in string inverter systems to optimize the power output of the string of panels. 
In a string inverter system, multiple strings of panels are connected in parallel between the AC grid and the DC bus. The inverter automatically adjusts the frequency, voltage, and power output of each individual string of panels, based on the needs of the individual string of panels.

For systems that are using a central inverter, MPPT is performed by the inverter. This type of inverter provides maximum power point tracking of PV modules with single string of panels.

In a central inverter system, the inverter is the only PV module that can perform MPPT.

For systems that are using a central inverter to provide DC to a string of panels, MPPT is performed by the inverter.

A common Indian spice is saffron , and it is the most expensive spice in the world. A teaspoon of saffron is equal to a day-long fast. It is a spice produced from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus. It is used in various Indian cuisine especially in the preparation of rice dishes.

Saffron is a spice produced from the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus. It is used in various Indian cuisine especially in preparation of rice dishes. It is also used in the preparation of Turkish dishes, soups, stews and curries. In India, it is often added at the end of cooking when the dish is served. The color of saffron is a rich orange-red, and it has a very strong and distinctive flavor which is very unique. It is traditionally used in the preparation of rice dishes and is available in the local markets in India.

Saffron is a form of crocus. The stigmas of this plant are used to produce the spice. The stigmas are dried and crushed to extract the flavor. The side effects of saffron are numerous and very harmful. The toxic effects of saffron result from its high content of safranal. This is an extremely toxic substance which can cause kidney failure and inflammation of the liver, stomach, and lungs. The toxicity of saffron is due to the presence of crocin. Crocin is a crocetin derivative. This substance is toxic and carcinogenic. It is a potent photosensitizer and is an allergenic substance. The toxic effects of saffron are more intense if it is taken in high doses.

Saffron is a spice which is rich in various nutrients. It is a good source of iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium. It is also rich in B complex vitamins. It is a good source of fiber. It is also rich in vitamins A and C. It has a mild and fresh flavor and is a good source of vitamin A. It is also rich in beta carotene. Saffron is a good source of vitamins B1, B2, B6, and B12. It also has a good content of antioxidants.

Q:

How to get value of ""this"" in callback?

I have a function that uses an external library and another function that handles the callback. The callback function is passed a string, however it does not have access to the object, in this case a Node
The function that has the callback uses the following code to send a message to the callback function:
var sendMessage = function(id, callback) {
    if (typeof(callback) === 'function') {
        var message = {id: id};
        send(message, function(err, data) {
            callback(err, data);
        });
    }
};

sendMessage(id, function(err, data) {
    console.log(this.id); //undefined
});

How can I get the value of ""this"" in the callback function?

A:

You can pass a function to the callback.
sendMessage(id, function (err, data) {
    console.log(this.id); //undefined
});

Is that what you want?

A:

You need to pass a function to the callback, not a string:
sendMessage(id, function(err, data) {
    console.log(this.id); //undefined
});

Who","Undrestanding the causes of the Alzheimer's disease is an ongoing research. The research so far indicate that causes probably include a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The importance of any one of these factors may differ from person to person. 
One well-known gene that influences Alzheimer’s risk is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, which has been identified via Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The APOE gene is involved in making a protein that helps carry cholesterol and other types of fat in the bloodstream.",0.14778,0.989138,25.265187,0.898709,0.162074,5.492578,-7.441032886505127

Displaying Data from two tables and linking them with each other

I have two tables, one with user ID's and other with the status of the user. For example:
User ID   Status
1         1
1         2
1         3
2         1
3         2
2         3

I want to make a query that displays the status number of the user, but also displays the user ID who has the status. For example:
Status Number     User ID
   1                 1
   1                 2
   1                 3

The transfer of a patient to another medical facility in the United States is a complex procedure which may require the coordination of a number of individuals and institutions. In particular, the patient's transfer may require a number of different facilities to be involved in the transfer. For example, the patient can be transferred from a first medical facility to a second facility and then to a third facility. The first, second and third facilities may each have a different set of capabilities, and the patient may need to be transferred to a particular facility having the necessary capabilities for the patient. For example, the patient may have to be transferred from a first medical facility to a second medical facility","John Dassow, Jr. (August 10, 1845 – October 8, 1917) was an American farmer, manufacturer, and politician.

Born in what is now Mecklenburg, Germany, Dassow emigrated with his parents, in 1861 to the United States and settled on a farm in the town of Sheboygan Falls, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. In 1864 and 1865, Dassow served in the 30th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. Dassow was a farmer and owned the Sheboygan County Mills. He was also involved with cheese factories and the real estate business. Dassow served on the Sheboygan County Board of Supervisors and was chairman of the county board.

Give me a list of funny American sitcoms that had their first season in the 2000s,", and I will make a show out of them.""

I can't really argue with that. The most recent show I can think of that had its first season in the 2000s is 30 Rock.

This was one of the funniest episodes of 30 Rock ever. It was the episode where Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) got a job as a talk show host and had to pretend to be a ""real"" talk show host and all the talk show producers came to his studio to interview him.

The premise was that Jack was supposed to be the host of a talk show where the guests would be a cross-section of the audience. So they would all be wearing banana costumes and the host would feed them all bananas and then make them all talk about how much they hated bananas.

There was a bunch of other stuff that happened in this episode, but this is the funniest part of it.

I'm not sure if I believe the premise for the episode or not, but I think the banana costumes were pretty funny.

I'm sure there are a lot of great sitcoms that were cancelled in the 2000s, but I don't think I can think of any I watched this decade. I watched a few on DVDs but I don't think that counts.

I didn't actually watch any TV this decade, either. I watched a few movies, but they weren't sitcoms.

Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
Only this and nothing more.”

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—

This can be deciphered by connecting letters offset by 6 within the string.  The first 3 letters with this pattern are ""t"", ""h"", ""e"" forming the word ""the"".  Spaces must be inferred from common words and word patterns.

Despite the fact that the number of malaria cases in Brazil has been falling since 2012, the disease continues to be a major public health problem in the country. Since the beginning of the 21st century, malaria has gradually become a chronic disease in the Amazon region, with the average annual number of cases ranging from 300,000 to 500,000 episodes \[[@CR1]\].

The Amazon region is the Brazilian territory with the highest incidence of malaria, where an estimated 60,000 cases of malaria occur annually \[[@CR1], [@CR2]\]. The Amazonian region, inclusive of the states of Acre, Amapá, Amazonas and Rondônia, is the largest Brazilian territory with the highest number of malarial cases in the country.

The Amazonian region includes some of the most heavily populated areas in the country, with about 8 million people living in approximately three million km^2^ \[[@CR3]\]. In this scenario, human activities are concentrated in cities and towns, where there is a large movement of people. This leads to human contact with mosquitos and a greater risk of transmission and consequently, a higher incidence of malaria \[[@CR4]\]. The population of the Amazon region is more heterogeneous than the population of other regions in Brazil, with a higher proportion of people of indigenous origin \[[@CR3]\].

In the Amazonian region, the main malaria vector is *Anopheles darlingi*, which is found in the peridomestic environment, where it is a well-adapted parasite to survive and develop in human blood \[[@CR5], [@CR6]\]. The epidemiological characterization of malaria in the Amazon region is of particular interest because it is one of the regions where malaria transmission is expected to be lower than in other regions of the country, especially in the southeast, where the transmission is considered to be under control \[[@CR7]\].

Therefore, it is important to understand the actual epidemiological situation of malaria disease in the Amazon region, what factors are associated with the disease and how the disease is distributed in the region.

"Tell me whether each of these players is a quarterback or running back: Ezekiel Elliot, Peyton Manning, Lamar Jackson, Leonard Fournette, Sam Darnold, Derrick Henry",", Saquon Barkley, Austin Ekeler?

I picked all of the first five, but you’re free to pick any five.

I’ll take a stab at five running backs over five quarterbacks.

1. Ezekiel Elliott, Dallas Cowboys, RB, 6-foot-1, 235, Dallas, Texas

Ezekiel Elliott is the top-ranked running back in fantasy football, and he’s going to be the top-ranked running back in the NFL this year.

I’m not saying Elliott is going to be a unanimous first-round pick, but I’d be shocked if he’s not the first running back selected.

Elliott is the ideal running back for a new-look Dallas Cowboys offense. He’s a physical runner, with great speed and vision. He has a knack for finding the open space, and his patience is a trait you rarely see in running backs.

The Cowboys will test Elliott’s patience a bit this year. With the departure of Darren McFadden, the Cowboys are going to run more zone-read plays for Ezekiel. He’ll get the majority of the carries, but he’s going to see a lot of snaps in the passing game as well.

He’s been the Cowboys’ best running back since their franchise back, DeMarco Murray, was traded. He’s going to see the majority of the carries in 2019.

2. Leonard Fournette, Jacksonville Jaguars, RB, 5-10, 223, New Orleans, Louisiana

Leonard Fournette is the best running back in the NFL, and it’s not even close.

Has there been a more impressive rookie season in football?

Fournette is a physical runner, and he has great speed. He’s also a pure power runner, which makes him a nightmare for linebackers.

Fournette’s ball security has been a question mark throughout his career, but he’s averaging 5.5 yards per carry in his first two NFL games. He’s also been a threat in the passing game, catching 14 passes for 156 yards and two scores.

Fournette is going to be a featured back for the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019. He’s a must-start every week.

The bicycle was invented in the early 1800 (1817) by a German inventor named Drais.  The early bicycles were built from wood and soon after used heavy steel for the frame and wheels.  These steel bikes were called Boneshakers because when you road on them you would feel every stone and bump through your bones.  Bicycling exists in nearly every corner of the world, on every continent and it is done by all people.  In many countries, bicycling is the primary mode of transportation for people, especially in urban settings.  Bicycling is also a professional sporting competition where men and women race against one another in large groups in front of cheering crowds.

Brainstorm reasons for and against taking a daily low-dose aspirin.,"a.com/blog/b/cognitive-behavioral-therapies/archive/2008/04/21/brainstorm-reasons-for-and-against-taking-a-daily-low-dose-aspirin.aspx#comments<p>If you've seen the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426488/"">Sideways</a>, you know that the movie's main character, Miles, is a staunch advocate of aspirin. In fact, the protagonist in the film is so convinced that aspirin is the best way to prevent heart disease that, despite his wife's reservations, he takes a daily low-dose aspirin regimen at the start of the film. I think most people have the same story about aspirin, and that's why the drug has such a strong image in our minds. However, despite the fact that aspirin is a valued tool for many people in their health care, alternative or complementary therapy approaches to heart disease prevention do exist.</p>
<p>Part of my work as a cognitive behavioral therapist involves the use of cognitive-behavioral approaches to health care. Cognitive-behavioral approaches to health care are based on the idea that it is possible to learn new ways of thinking and behaving in order to help people change their feelings and behaviors that can negatively impact their health. In fact, cognitive-behavioral approaches to health care are based on the idea that the brain is malleable and that people can learn new ways of thinking and behaving that will help them improve their health.</p>
<p>In thinking about the role of aspirin, cognitive-behavioral therapists recognize that people can learn new ways of thinking and behaving that may help them achieve their health goals. In fact, people are already using cognitive-behavioral approaches to health care in their attempts to manage arthritis. For example, people with arthritis often use a cognitive-behavioral approach to arthritis management to better understand how to use medications, exercise, and other non-pharmacological interventions to manage their symptoms. Additionally, cognitive-behavioral approaches to health care are often used by people with heart disease to help them overcome their fears and to manage their emotions. For example, people with heart disease often use cognitive-behavioral approaches to heart disease management in order to better understand how they can manage their feelings (such as anxiety and depression) so that they can better manage their overall health and wellness.</p>
<p>In thinking about the role","According to Berkeley Wellness, there’s evidence that a daily aspirin “protects people already diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD).” However, there is insufficient evidence that a daily low-dose aspirin is as effective for primary prevention; it is not as necessarily effective for people who have “not been diagnosed with CVD.” Additionally, high BMI may also alter the way aspirin is metabolized, further complicating the data. Finally, there’s evidence that suddenly stopping aspirin can actually increase the risk of a heart attack or stroke. Thus, not everyone should be taking a daily low-dose aspirin - consult your doctor!",0.275402,0.998626,9.324346,0.995227,0.505378,2.419796,-3.6171934604644775
When do Muslims fast?,";

As the Islamic calendar is lunar, the fasting month is divided into two parts: Ramadan and the month of Dhul Hijjah. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar. It is also known as the month of Ramadan or the Month of Fasting. The fasting month is based on the lunar calendar, and in 2020 it will be May 15-June 15. The month of Ramadan is from the sighting of the crescent moon until the sighting of the new moon. The new moon is when the moon is first seen in the sky after the 15 day period of Ramadan. The month of Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar.

What is the purpose of fasting?Fasting is the abstinence of food, drink and sexual contact during the daytime hours of the day in Ramadan. Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, or pillars of faith. Animals do not fast during Ramadan, but fasting is a requirement for all Muslims.What should you eat in the month of Ramadan?All Muslims should abstain from eating, drinking, and sexual contact during the daytime hours of the day in Ramadan. Muslims are allowed to eat or drink before sunset. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, ""Whoever fasts with his stomach full, shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise."" How long is the fast?The fast in Ramadan may vary by region. The fast is broken with sips of water or a drink of dates. The fast is typically broken in the early evening. But the length of the fast is decided by the individual, based on hunger level and level of thirst. What is the value of the fast?The value of the fast has been mentioned in the Quran. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ""The reward of fasting is that on the night of fast, the angel Gabriel comes to one of you and commands him to eat and drink and says, 'Eat and drink! This is what you were doing!' He says, 'I was commanded to fast and you were commanded to eat and drink. But I did not find you doing either of these. So, do not break your fast until I come to you and command you to eat and drink.'""

Field of the Invention
The present invention relates generally to the field of photographing, and more particularly to an apparatus and method for photographing with a portable device.
2. Description of the Related Art
Recently, digital still camera (DSC) technology has become popular with consumers. A DSC is a device that can take a digital photo. The DSC has an image sensor that captures an image and a digital camera that processes and stores the image.
Digital still cameras are becoming smaller and thinner. They are also being made lighter and more portable. Some of the DSC devices have a compressing function that compresses the image captured by the image sensor. When a user compresses the image, the device is able to store more image data in the memory of the device.
The conventional compression function compresses the image captured by the image sensor. The compression function compresses the image in the shutter speed range.

What are two species of beavers?,".org/beaver.html

Did you know that beavers build dams? Not only do they make dams, they also help to control flooding, help to clean the water supply and prevent erosion. Beavers are very important to the environment and their impact on the environment is often overlooked. However, in the past few decades beavers have become an endangered species. This is because of the destruction of dams and the loss of habitat. Beavers are now protected in Canada as well as in the USA. However, in many areas there are still dams that are being destroyed by humans.

What is a beaver? A beaver is a rodent that lives in Canada and the USA. It is one of the largest rodents on the planet. Beavers have long, flat, paddle-like tails and their fur is often reddish brown or black. Beavers live in burrows and they have sharp teeth. Beavers have two sets of paws, front and rear. Beavers use their front paws to hold branches and use their rear paws to push logs or stones. Beavers use their flat tails to keep their bodies balanced. Beavers build dams, which are made of branches, mud and sticks. Beavers also build lodges, which are made of wood and mud. Beavers live in pairs and females have three to five babies. Beavers find food mainly by eating twigs, bark, roots and nuts.

Two species of beavers live in the USA and Canada. The black beaver (Castor canadensis) is the largest rodent. It lives in the USA and in Canada. It has a brown back and a greyish black tail. The North American beaver (Castor fiber) is the smallest of the beaver species. It can be found in Canada and the USA. It has a reddish brown back and a black tail. Beavers mate only once a year. They live in pairs and raise their young in a lodge or a den. They can live up to 12 years in the wild.

Beavers probably lived on the North American continent for over 10,000 years. Beavers were originally found in Africa. However, they were later found in Europe and Asia. Beavers have been found frozen in the ice of Canada. The beavers that were in Canada at this time were the ancestors of the North American beavers. The ancestors of the North American beavers crossed the land bridge that existed between Asia and North",The two species of beavers are the North American beaver and the Eurasian beaver.,0.293624,0.985623,33.799366,0.975101,0.290999,7.268943,-3.796727418899536

Q:

How to find the 3rd and 4th largest elements in a list with O(n) time?

Given a list of numbers, I need to find the 3rd and fourth largest elements in O(n) time.
Example:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
(in this list, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 is the list)
Output:
4,5,6
3,5,6
4,5,6
5,6,7

Code:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    List<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 };
    int max = numbers.Max();
    int 3rdMax = numbers.Select((x, index) => new { index })
                .OrderByDescending(n => n.index)
                .Where(n => n.index == max)
                .Select(n => n.x).First();
    int 4thMax = numbers.Select((x, index) => new { index })
                .OrderByDescending(n => n.index)
                .Where(n => n.index == max)
                .Select(n => n.x).Skip(1).First();
}

I am using .Select(n => n.x).First(); to get the 3rd largest number, but the it's taking O(n^2) time.

A:

You can use the following LINQ query:
var result = numbers.GroupBy(n => n)
    .Select(g => g.OrderByDescending(n => n.Key).First())
    .Skip(1)
    .Take(3);

The query groups the numbers by the key of the group, then orders them by descending key and takes the first three elements.
The query first takes the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... , N-1, the N-1 most sorted element, and then takes the first element from the remaining numbers.

""It's a very sad day for India"", said Modi. ""It's very sad for our people, it's very sad for our entire nation"", he told the gathering.

Modi was the first Indian prime minister to address the gathering of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which has ruled for the last 10 years.

""This is a moment of national pride"".

The BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Narendra Modi, has become the first Indian Prime Minister to address the Congress's Republic Day celebration in New Delhi.

""Although we have not been able to do much in the last 10 years, but I will be happy if we can do a little bit in the next 10 years"", he added.

Modi, who was the first to speak at the event, said the nation was celebrating the republic day for the third time and its government had the ""greatest respect"" for the ""martyrs"" who laid down their lives.

""We have been able to scale new heights"", he said, referring to the dwindling number of poor people in the country.

What are the differences between a ""gun"" and a ""rifle""?

What are the differences between a ""gun"" and a ""rifle""?

A:

Rifles have a barrel. Guns are not restricted to being long guns. They can be handguns, shotguns, or any mechanically operated firearm.

A:

Rifles (or rifles) are firearms that have a long barrel. They are typically much heavier than handguns, which means that they need to be fired with the help of an ammo belt or some other type of mechanism.
Guns (or pistols) are firearms that have a short barrel. They are typically lighter than rifles, and can be fired using a single bullet or a clip of bullets (most modern handguns are actually semi-automatic, meaning that they are capable of being fired multiple times without reloading).

What are the main functions on a DSLR camera that affect the correct the exposure of an image?,", the camera reacts to the scene light.

It may not be possible to find a completely correct exposure when the light meter in your camera is giving you a reading. However, a camera will respond to the scene light and change the exposure. A camera will also respond to certain types of lighting, and the way it does this will be different depending on the type of camera.

Your camera will respond to certain types of lighting, and the way it does this will be different depending on the type of camera.

1) the Aperture - how wide the aperture on the lens is set determines how much light can pass through the aperture. A small aperture (e.g. f/16) allows less light to reach the sensor as opposed to a wide aperture (e.g f/2.4).
2) the Shutter Speed - how long the shutter is allowed to remain open after you depress the release on the camera. A short exposure time (e.g. 1/1000 sec) will allow less light to hit the cameras sensor whilst a long exposure (e.g. 1/4 sec) will let more light hit the sensor
3) the ISO setting - this setting is used to control how sensitive the sensor is to light hitting it. A low ISO setting (e.g. ISO 200) is much less sensitive than a high ISO setting (e.g. ISO 1600) which means less light is required to capture the for the image on the",0.254706,0.998671,32.113208,0.995509,0.254661,6.923351,-4.852461338043213

A:

The time series data is a data stream of numbers, so it is a data stream. If you have multiple data streams, it is a stream of streams, if you have multiple streams of streams, it is a stream of streams of streams of streams.
Anytime you have the same data repeated over and over, that's a time series.
You can always convert a time series to something else.
For example, if you have the same data, but in a different time scale, you can convert it to a graph, which is what a bar chart is. If you have the same data, but in different numbers, you can convert it to a table. If you have the same data, but in different data types, you can convert it to a list.
So, basically, you can convert any data to anything, if you know how to do it. In the simplest case, these are all exact.

A:

Time series are data sets that consists of a sequence of data (possibly time-indexed).
A given time series is always a sequence of data with same number of elements.
That's all.



The concept of the 'universal language' - Out of curiosity, I recently came across the concept of a universal language. It was called Enochian. It was used by the ancient Egyptian priest-priestesses who were the keepers of the secrets of the Pyramids, and was also used by the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar were the keepers of the secrets of the Holy Grail, and it is believed that they used this language to communicate with the angels. We have always been told that this language is a secret, but it is not. It is not a secret if we put our minds to it. It is a secret if you allow it to be a secret. The only reason that the Templars are not in the public domain is because they used this language to communicate with the angelic beings they were in contact with.

""The Knights Templar, who were the keepers of the secrets of the Holy Grail, used a secret language called ""Enochian"". This language was used by the ancient priests of the Egyptian Antiquities to record the sacred knowledge of the Pyramids.

"What did Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, die from?",".

Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, died from complications of pancreatic cancer in 2011. What did Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, die from?

A:

Steve Jobs died from complications of pancreatic cancer. He was 56.  

In 2004, he was diagnosed with cancer and began treatment. The illness
  required surgery in 2006, and he was placed in a medically induced
  coma for four weeks. He was released from the hospital and underwent
  chemotherapy and took medication.
Jobs underwent an operation to remove a cancerous tumor from his
  pancreas in January 2011, at which time he was given the option of
  having his liver and a portion of his small intestine removed as part
  of the surgery. His doctors said that they would remove the cancer if
  he agreed to the surgery. However, Jobs opted to have the tumor
  removed from his liver first. After that procedure, he was placed in a
  coma to ensure that the tumor did not return and was released from the
  hospital on February 24, 2011.

Who is the all time leading passer in the NFL?,"

It's Miller. He's the all time leader in passing yards. He's also the only player to ever throw for 50+ TD's in a season.

That's not all. Miller has the most career TD's (46) and is a member of the record books:

Highest Passing Average (min. 80 attempts)

Most Passing Yards in a Season (min. 80 attempts)

Most Passing Yards and TD's in a Season (min. 80 attempts)

Most Passing Yards and Touchdowns in a season (min. 80 attempts)

The list goes on, but those are the big ones.

who's the all time leading rusher?

People need to give up on this argument.

In the 30s and 40s, the rushing numbers were inflated by the rule changes. Those rules changed in the 70s and 80s, and the numbers dropped some.

But that's not the only thing that changed.

The rules were changed to make the offenses more complicated. The NFL has moved to more passing and less running.

If the NFL had stayed with the same running rules, there would be a smaller gap between the passing and rushing leaders.

I agree, but I think that the passing numbers are inflated.

If you could see the game as it was play-by-play, you would see that the passing numbers are way overstated.

What is Ayurveda?,". Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word meaning ‘the science of life.’ According to Ayurveda, every human being is made up of three fundamental elements called ‘dhatu’—earth, water, and fire. These elements are held together by five elements called ‘tanmatra’—space, time, air, water, and ether. Ayurvedic philosophy perceives the human body as a microcosm of the universe. Ayurveda’s principles of balance and harmony apply to all aspects of daily life, including diet and exercise.Ayurveda has been around for centuries, and its principles are as sound today as they were centuries ago. Ayurvedic principles of nutrition, lifestyle, and healing are widely practiced in India and other parts of Asia, and Ayurvedic physicians are active in the United States.

Ayurvedic physicians understand that a person’s body is made up of a unique combination of dhatu and tanmatra. Each person’s dhatu is expressed differently. The elements in the person’s body are each assigned a specific role to play in the maintenance of health and well-being. When Ayurvedic physicians see a client, they take into account the dhatu, tanmatra, and asanas (postures) of his or her body. (For more information on Ayurvedic medicine, see the booklet The Basics of Ayurveda: A Practical Guide to Healing the Body.)

Ayurveda is based on the belief that the body is an expression of the mind and spirit. Certain foods are considered to be good for certain dhatus and tanmatras. According to Ayurvedic philosophy, a person’s happiness and health are linked to his or her lifestyle. For this reason, Ayurvedic physicians recommend a diet that balances all the dhatus, tanmatras, and asanas.

Sattvic foods are considered to be nutritious and are good for the mind and body. They are considered to be “cooler” than rajasic and tamasic foods. Sattvic foods are considered to be more conducive to a balanced mind and body. They include salads, vegetables, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and seeds (including sesame, chia, flax, and hemp). Sattvic foods are believed to be beneficial to both the body and the mind.

Rajas","Ayurveda is a natural system of medicine that originated in India more than 3,000 years ago. The term Ayurveda is derived from the Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, Ayurveda translates to knowledge of life. Based on the idea that disease is due to an imbalance or stress in a person's consciousness, Ayurveda encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment.",0.268088,0.999335,17.337595,0.9987,0.324783,3.9857,-3.7205517292022705

Please give me a summary of what AES-GCM is and what are its inputs and outputs.,".

If it's not too much trouble, could you give me a link to the paper that describes how it works? It looks like the paper describes the algorithm, but it's mostly in German / Chinese and I don't speak either one of those languages.

The paper is called ""A Fast and Efficient Implementation of the AES GCM Mode of Operation,"" and it is written in German. The link is here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.02460v1.pdf (I haven't read the paper yet, just skimmed it.)

from what I gather so far, aes-gcm is basically a way of doing aes-cbc-essiv -gcm. If you have to provide the iv and the key, you just need to do the equivalent of the aes-cbc-essiv-ecb output. In other words, if you have aes-cbc-essiv-ecb -a-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1, then aes-gcm-a-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1 = aes-cbc-essiv-ecb-a-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1. What am I missing here?

Basically, the only difference is that, in aes-cbc-essiv, the -1s just mean that the input is not (initially) empty. In aes-gcm, the -1s mean that the plaintext was not (initially) empty.

But I think it's not necessary to explain that. Aes-cbc-essiv is basically aes-cbc-essiv-ecb, and aes-gcm is basically aes-ecb-gcm. The only difference between the two is in the additional condition that the plaintext must not be empty.

I think the paper is saying that aes-gcm is aes-ecb-gcm, but using aes-gcm-a-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1","AES-GCM is a mode of operation for symmetric-key cryptography.

Can you tell me where these cities are located on the world map: North America, South Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Africa. BEFORE YOU READ ON, I would like you to take a moment to PRINT OUT THIS MAP.

The first question I was asked was “Where are Singapore, Malaysia and Argentina?” It took the geniuses at Google to help me answer this one. I did not realize how many ways I could have used the world map to answer this question. Here are the answers.

The answer is: Singapore, Malaysia, and Argentina are all in South America.

The answer is: Singapore, Malaysia, and Argentina are all in South America.

The answer is: Singapore, Malaysia, and Argentina are all in South America.

You can see that the countries and cities are all in South America.

This is the first question that was asked to me and I used a map. I had no idea what the countries were or where they were located. I had no idea what the answers meant. But, I knew that they were in South America.

Why is this important?

If you are in the United States and you are not sure where Singapore is, you can go to Google Maps and look it up. If you are in Asia and you are not sure where Australia is, you can go to Google Maps and look it up. If you are in Europe and you are not sure where Italy is, you can go to Google Maps and look it up. If you are in Africa and you are not sure where Zimbabwe is, you can go to Google Maps and look it up.

What does the Gini coefficient measure?,".berkeley.edu/gini.html

The Gini coefficient measures how unequal a distribution is, and it does so in a way that is easy to understand. At a certain level of inequality, a single person will have the same wealth as a whole number of people. As the inequality of wealth increases, the number of people with the same amount of wealth will decrease. The Gini coefficient measures this number of people with the same amount of wealth. The greater the Gini coefficient, the greater the inequality of wealth. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1.0. A Gini coefficient of 0.0 means that everyone has the same amount of money. A Gini coefficient of 0.5 means that half of the people have more money than the other half. A Gini coefficient of 0.9 means that 90% of the people have more money than the other 10%.

Does there exist a non-deterministic Turing machine for every input?

I am interested in the following question: Does there exist a non-deterministic Turing machine for every input?
Can someone please give me a hint how I should approach this problem?

A:

There are non-deterministic Turing machines which recognize every possible input.
Let $\Sigma$ be the Turing machine alphabet, and $\Sigma^*$ the Turing machine alphabet with the empty string as an additional symbol.
A non-deterministic Turing machine $M$ is one which has an input $\sigma$ of the form $\sigma = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_n$ and an output $Y \in \Sigma^*$ and accepts if there exists $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ such that $\sigma_i = \varepsilon$ and $Y = \sigma_1 \cdots \sigma_i$.
If $\Sigma$ is finite, and $X \in \Sigma^*$ is a string over $\Sigma$ of length $n$, then there is a non-deterministic Turing machine which recognizes $X$ and accepts if and only if $X = 0^n1$.
The Turing machine $M$ can be constructed in the following way:

What is LoL?

LoL (short for “League of Legends”) is a free-to-play, online multiplayer game developed by Riot Games for Windows (PC), Windows Phone, and Macintosh (Mac). LoL is a game of heroes, skills, and spells, where players select one of several champions (players) to control and lead their characters into battle. Each time players win a game, they are awarded with experience points (XP) that can be used to upgrade their champions’ skills. LoL can be played individually or with others in a variety of different “lanes” (servers).

The game is divided into two modes: “ranked” and “unranked”. Ranked games allow players to participate in ranked matches, which are generally more competitive and have better rewards for winning. Unranked games are for players who just want to have fun competing against their friends and other players.

What are the rules of LoL?

The rules of LoL are simple—a player controls a hero or a team of heroes, who fight against other players and their respective teams. Each player has a maximum of five characters (champions) of their own (or “creeps” as they are referred to). Each character starts with a basic skill (such as “Crowd Control” or “Magic Resist”) and a passive ability (such as Regeneration and Regeneration). Skill levels and passives are increased with experience points.

Once players reach level 10 (the “Summoner Level”), they can select a champion from a pool of over 30 champions. A champion can be changed at any time, provided they have enough experience points. Each champion has different strengths and weaknesses, and abilities that are unique to that champion.

LoL is played in two modes: “ ranked “and “unranked “. In ranked mode, players are divided into teams of 5 players. The highest ranked team wins. In unranked mode, every player is a champion, and the game is played by the individual players.

Who is the game for?

LoL is designed for players of any age and skill level. There are many different characters to choose from, and each one has their own strengths and weaknesses (some are better at team fights, others at magic damage, etc.). It is possible to play LoL with friends and family,","League of legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle game with a team of 5 players on each side of the arena playing against each other.

I would think that you would just tip the drink (or soda) over the edge of a table and it falls out. You would probably need to tip the glass to get it to do that, though.

A:

If you have a valid dataframe, and you want to group them by the rules which you gave, the most straightforward solution would be to use groupby:
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({""Country"": [""CA"", ""DE"", ""US"", ""FR"", ""UK"", ""IT"", ""NL""],
                   ""Latitude"": [-10, -5, 0, 15, 35, 40, -25],
                   ""Longitude"": [180, 160, 90, 0, 105, 105, 110]})

print(df)

   Country  Latitude   Longitude
0       DE       -5         160
1       DE       -5         160

6       IT       0          105
7      NL       -25        -25

Then you can use applymap to apply your function, and groupby to group the country by the class:
def func(x):
    if x.Latitude >= 0:
        return 1
    elif x.Latitude <= 10:
        return 2
    else:
        return 3

Or use the apply method on the function and groupby:
def func(x):
    if x.Latitude >= 0:
        return 1
    elif x.Latitude <= 10:
        return 2

"Given a reference text about the Kaziranga Elephant Festival, tell me who organizes it.","o.com/2011/11/kaziranga-elephant-festival/

In my opinion, there are two main things to consider when planning a trip to Kaziranga National Park. The first is elevation. The park is located on the edge of the Himalayas and, because of that, the elevation is somewhere around 3,000 feet. That being said, Kaziranga is a great place to visit for a couple of reasons. First, the park is home to one of the very few populations of one of the most endangered species on the planet. The Indian one-horned rhinoceros, the Gharial, is found here. The second thing to consider is the weather. Kaziranga is located in the Indian state of Assam, and the weather can get pretty unpredictable. The park is best visited from October through March.

The best time to visit the park is between October and March. The weather is cooler and wetter during this time, and that is when the rhinos are most active.

There are two major ways to visit the park. One is on a tour that takes you to Kaziranga, and the other is on a trek of the park. If you do decide to stay in the park, the best thing to do is book a stay at the Rhino Lodge, which is located in the southern part of the park. There are many tour operators that can take you to the park, or you can hire a guide to take you there.

A tour that takes you to Kaziranga is a great way to see the park. In fact, the park is so popular that there is a massive price difference in the two different ways to see it. If you choose a tour, then you can get up close and personal with the rhinos. During one of the tours, you can even get to touch a rhino!

If you choose a trek of the park, then you will see the park in a much different way. You will be able to see the park from the top and the bottom, and you can see a lot of different things. The best part of the trek is that you can see a lot of wildlife, including tigers. The trek is not for everyone, and it is a hard trek, but it is a great adventure.

The best time to visit is between October and March.

Why do people enjoy baseball?,"a died in 2002

A:

Hopefully, you are not looking for the answer in terms of baseball, but in terms of people enjoying life.
It is a simple way to spend time with friends and family:

People enjoy baseball because it is a game where there is a clear winner, and the
  winner is generally determined by the quality of the player's skills. Whereas in
  other team sports, you have to put up with a loss, and somebody has to be ""the
  bad guy"", in baseball the nice guys always win.

Manila (CNN Philippines Life) — There's no denying the historical significance of South Korea's first Olympics, which were held in Seoul in 1988 and which is now the country's second largest tourist attraction.

The games served as a symbol of the country's political and economic rejuvenation, sparking the emergence of a new democracy, and the country's first peaceful transition of power from dictatorship to democracy.

The games also paved the way for the country's participation in the World Cup in 2006.

The games also helped change the country's view of itself from being a ""Shining Nation"" to a ""Sporting Nation"".

It was also the first time that the Asian Games, which then took place in the country every four years, were held outside of the Asian continent.

The 1988 Seoul Olympics were jubilant yet somber.

The games were the first time that the Olympics had been held in Asia, thanks to the hosting of the Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria.

The sweeping victory of South Korea in the ice hockey and figure skating events led to a sense of euphoria for the country.

The country's medal tally was dominated by the women's ice hockey team, which won a record 23 medals, and the ice dancers, who won a record eight gold medals.

The South Korean women's hockey team won silver at the 1988 Games, the first time that women's hockey was added to the Olympics. The men's team won gold.

The next year, the figure skating team won gold, the first time that figure skating was included in the Olympics.

Give me a list of the most interesting moons in our solar system," - hollandale@yahoo.com

It's been a while since I've been in the Moon-Related News forum, and I'm looking forward to re-familiarizing myself with the community and its discussions.Among my pet peeves:1) If you want to find a good technical discussion about a lunar topic, try the Lunar Section of Scientific American.2) I like the NASA RSS feed.3) The lunar section of the Space News newsletter is another good source, though not as up-to-the-minute as the NASA feed.4) The LRO news is discussed in the Spaceflight forum.5) I don't know how to find a good discussion about the Planetary Society's MoonPedia. This one's a little harder, but I think it's worth a try. I know there's a Lunar and Planetary Society forum, but it's not clear to me how to navigate that forum.

I must say, the LRO images are superb. I've been to the Moon and I have to say that those images are the best I've ever seen. The light on the Moon is amazing. I am still wondering what that strange area in the southern part of the moon is that is so bright.

I'm sure that we will learn a lot more from the LRO images. We are going to have a great time on the Moon -- probably the greatest time in our history. I am looking forward to the future, and this is perhaps the only event that we will ever have the opportunity to do in our lifetime.

Paul, I think you are embarrassed to use the NASA image because it is so poorly done and it does not show the Apollo landing site. The best lunar photo I have seen is the one by the USGS.

There are some excellent images from the LRO pictures. You can find some of those here: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/gallery/lro/index.php.

I downloaded one of these pictures and it's a great one, but it's not as clear as the one I linked to.

I'm sure you can find a number of other lunar images to compare with. A couple of my favorites are here:

The present invention relates to a process for producing a synthetic filament yarn with a good twist stiffness and good dimensional stability.
A known process for producing a synthetic filament yarn is that using an extruder and a forming-drawing-twisting yarn package. In the process, a thermoplastic resin, such as a polyester, is melted and extruded into molten yarn, which is then drawn into a yarn and formed by a package and further cooled. The yarn is wound on a package bobbin and is then thermally set to obtain a filament yarn.
The filament yarn thus obtained is very useful as a textile yarn. However, the filament yarn obtained by the known process has the following disadvantage: When a synthetic filament yarn is produced using a fiber spinning machine, for example, a spinning frame, a so-called ""figure"" is formed on a yarn. The figure is a twist irregularity in a yarn, which is caused by variations in the drawing conditions of the yarn. The figure gives a particular impression to the touch and causes a marked decrease in the quality of the yarn. Particularly, in a filament yarn, the twist irregularities are prominent and the figure is more conspicuous compared with a spun yarn.
As a process for removing the twist irregularity of a filament yarn, there has been proposed a process in which a filament yarn is twisted at a temperature higher than a temperature at which the yarn is thermally set to obtain a yarn with a twist stiffness higher than the thermal set twist stiffness. However, the twist stiffness of the yarn obtained in this process is extremely low. Further, in the process, the yarn obtained after twisting is twisted at a high temperature, and thus a thermal stress is applied to the yarn. Therefore, the yarn tends to be destroyed, and the yarn is not suitable for use as a textile yarn.
Further, a synthetic filament yarn is often formed into a fabric, and the yarn is then subjected to dyeing or finishing treatment. In the dyeing and finishing treatment, the yarn is subjected to a large tension and a large distortion. As a result, the yarn is damaged and the yarn is cut to have a yarn with a twist irregularity.

“Ghost Adventures” Researcher Claims He Detected Aliens

Fort Worth, Texas – The “Ghost Adventures” show is not only the most popular paranormal show in America, it is also the most popular show on television.

The show, hosted by Zak Bagans and Aaron Goodwin, offers viewers a chance to investigate some very unusual places.

In the first of the show’s 31-episode, four-part series, the duo investigated the Haunted Texas State Mental Hospital.

In the episode, the pair tried to make contact with the spirit of a woman named Virginia.

On Tuesday, Bagans was interviewed by the Washington Post, where he claimed that he and his team heard sounds that they believed were the voices of aliens.

“The first time I heard it, I said, ‘Holy s**t,’” he said. “I was shocked. And I don’t get shocked very easily.”

The sound was reportedly coming from the basement, and Bagans said that the light was on when he heard it.

“It was coming out of the basement, it was echoing,” he said. “It was coming up through the floor.”

The sound was described as a “buzzy, clicking sound.”

Bagans said that he and his team were trying to contact the spirits of the former occupants of the building, but he said that the spirits were not responsive.

“We did not get a response,” he said. “We could hear it, but we couldn’t get a response.”

In the next episode, the duo of Zak Bagans and Aaron Goodwin are supposed to investigate a haunted house in Fort Worth, Texas.

Zak Bagans, who has investigated the most haunted locations in America, said that he and his team are ready for anything.

“I don’t know what we’re going to say right now,” he said. “We’re all excited. It’s like a kid in a candy store, going to get their favorite candy.”

Aaron Goodwin said that he does not believe in ghosts, but he thinks that they are very likely.

“I think that the ghosts are out there,” he said. “I’m pretty sure they are.”

Bagans said that he is not afraid of the ghosts, and he","Although there is no definitive evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial life, pictures and videos of UFOs, although of low quality, have proven to many people that not only does extraterrestrial life exist, but it is visiting Earth regularly.",0.198473,0.994061,3.149312,0.992343,0.262633,1.119364,-6.594371795654297

Why You Need an Appliance Checklist

Appliance Checklist

In this video, appliance expert Lisa M. Lamendola shows you how to use an appliance checklist to prevent common appliance mistakes.

Transcript

Hi, I'm Lisa M. Lamendola, and I'm here to talk about a checklist that you can use to prevent common kitchen mistakes.

It's called an appliance checklist.

So, what you do is you pull this out and you write down the manufacturer of the appliance, the type of appliance, its model number, and you also write down its serial number. And then you just put it on your refrigerator.

It's a great idea to say, hey, what's going on in here?

And then if you think that there's a problem with something that's going on in here, you don't have to feel embarrassed or ashamed or ashamed to call me and say, hey, I think something's wrong with this refrigerator.

And I will tell you exactly what it is.

We all have had times when we had a refrigerator malfunction or a freezer malfunction. And the first thing I do is I check the appliance checklist, and I'm going to go right down the list.

And the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to check the door seals, because I don't want to have any mold or noxious gases from refrigerants going into the refrigerator.

So, I'm going to go to the door seals.

And then I'm going to check to see if the door gaskets are leaking.

So, I'm going to go to the door gaskets, and I'm going to check the door gaskets for water stains.

And then I'm going to check to see if the door gasket is cracked or broken.

And then I'm going to check the door gaskets to see if they are old and worn out.

What does bpa-free mean?," bpa-free. BPA free is a chemical that is used in the manufacture of many plastics. BPA is a known endocrine disruptor. BPA plastics leach out chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA). The chemicals are present in the plastic when it is formed. They migrate out during use and can leach into food and beverages. BPA is also found in many hard plastics such as water bottles, baby bottles, food storage containers and dental sealants. It can also be found in some antiperspirant and deodorant products. BPA is often called a ""chemical of concern"" by USA government agencies. It is not known to be genotoxic but may be an endocrine disruptor.

What is bpa-free?

BPA Free products are those which have undergone a method of removal of BPA and other chemicals which can migrate from plastics. This can be achieved by either using a BPA-free additive or by using a process known as 'phase inversion' which works using heat. The product is then free from BPA and other chemicals which could migrate.

"From the following description of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, identify the person condidered the leader of the Hatfields."," the person considered the leader of the McCoy.

The Hatfield family had a long-standing feud with the McCoy family of Smith Mountain. One of the Hatfields, Ben, lived with the McCoy family for a short period in the 1930s. During this stay, he learned about the feud from the McCoy family.

From this knowledge, Ben Hatfield became the leader of the Hatfield-McCoy feud. The feud began after a Hatfield and a McCoy got into an argument over which family owned the best land in the area. This argument led to a series of murders in the late 1930s and early 1940s. By the time the feud was over, hundreds of people had been killed. The feud continued until 1958, when Ben Hatfield died.

The Hatfield-McCoy feud was a violent conflict that caused a loss of life on both sides. The Hatfields were a family of armed and dangerous men who were willing to kill for their cause. The McCoy family was a violent group of men who were willing to kill to defend their honor.

The Hatfield-McCoy feud was a conflict between two families that lasted for more than 30 years. The feud began in the 1930s. Hatfield and McCoy families had been feuding for years over the ownership of a tract of land in the Appalachian Mountains. This land was located in Logan County, Kentucky.

The feud began after one of the Hatfield’s, Ben, lived with the McCoy family for a short period of time in the 1930s. During this time, the Hatfield family learned about the feud from the McCoy family. This knowledge made Ben Hatfield the leader of the feud.

The feud resulted in several deaths, some of which were accidental, and many others caused by revenge or retaliation by one family against the other. The feud ended in 1958, when Ben Hatfield was killed. The Hatfield-McCoy feud is a classic example of the folklore of the Appalachian mountains.

The Hatfield-McCoy feud ended in 1958 after a series of raids. As the feud progressed, more violent acts were committed. The feud was a conflict between two families that lasted for more than 30 years. The Hatfields were a family of armed and dangerous men who were willing to kill for their cause. The McCoy family was a violent group of men who were willing to kill to defend their honor.

What steps can I take to avoid getting hit by a falling window from a skyscraper while walking about in downtown during high winds?,", for example.

A:

As you noted, damage to windows is a concern that should be addressed.
There is a regulatory requirement that when a window breaks, the building owner must provide ""prompt and reliable access to the interior of the building to permit maintenance, repair and other repair work.""  The purpose of this is to allow the building owner to quickly access the interior of the building and prevent further damage to the structure.  
If the window is falling on the sidewalk, and you are not in a safe location to move to, the building owner is required to provide access to the interior of the building.  This is to allow you to enter the building and move to a safe area.
In your example, the building owner has a window on the sidewalk that is falling on the sidewalk.  They need to provide access to the interior of the building.
If the building owner has no interior access (like a basement), or you are in a safe location to move to (like a fire escape) then the building owner does not need to provide access to the interior of the building.  In this case you would not need to enter the building.

A:

Building owners must provide access to the interior of their buildings to maintenance, repair or replacement workers.
If an interior window is broken, they must provide access to the interior.

I'm not sure how to address this for a building owner who doesn't have an interior window open to the interior of the building.

A:

I don't believe there is any requirement that they have to provide you with the option of entering the building, but an abundance of caution should be taken. 
It is possible that the window is in a location that will not allow you to safely enter the building. I would recommend calling your building's management office to discuss this.

1. The space area close to a doorway or near windows is most likely to be affected by falling items, and it is best to stay away from buildings, trees and tall electric or telephone poles. Find an open space, far away from these objects and stay low to the ground to reduce your chances of being hit by debris.
2. One of the safest places to avoid getting hit by falling objects is underground in a basement with no windows. Try to find underground spaces in downtown like the lower levels of buildings and malls, or the subway. 
3. If you absolutely need to be outside and close to tall buildings, try to stay alert and keep an eye out for falling debris. 
4.

What is the fundamental problem of economics as a discipline?,"conomic theory today fails to recognize that a society's economic institution is not an end in itself. it is a means to achieve some other end. i like to think of that end as a set of preferences for the use of economic resources that are shared by the members of a society.

Why is the term ""homeschooled"" important?

Homeschooling is not the same as unschooling or unschooling. Homeschooling is not a choice, it's a requirement. Homeschooling is the legal and social process of teaching a child at home, usually through the use of a curriculum, textbooks, workbooks, etc. A person who homeschools is called a homeschooler. Keep in mind that states are free to assign the term ""homeschool"" to any school program that meets their state's requirements. Homeschooling is a legal requirement in all 50 states, and is also a requirement in the District of Columbia. For example, in the state of Oregon, homeschooling is defined as ""the education of a child by a parent or other person with the child's consent, at the option of the parent or other person, in the child's own dwelling and under the direction of a person recognized by the State Board of Education as qualified to teach the subjects in the State-approved curriculum"" (Oregon Revised Statute, Chapter 339).

Unschooling is a process of teaching children at home without the use of any curriculum or textbooks. In most homeschooling programs, some lessons may still be learned from books and worksheets, but unschooling is not the same as homeschooling. Unschooling is a choice, and unschooling is not a requirement. Neither is unschooling a requirement in every state.

Homeschooling is a requirement to be a member of many organizations, and unschooling is not a requirement to belong to any organizations. Many organizations, such as summer camps, Boy Scouts, Girls Scouts, 4-H, youth sports organizations,","The workout is done in memory to Michael Murphy who died in Afghanistan in June 2005.

What were the main features of the Articles of Confederation?

The Articles of Confederation were a set of agreements made by the thirteen states of the United States in 1776. The Articles were a set of agreements that dictated the relationship between the thirteen states and set up a Congress (representing the states) to make laws for the country.

The Articles were a series of","The Articles of Confederation (AoC) was the first written constitution of the United States. There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct “foreign or commercial relations with other countries” (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also “suggested a federal court system”.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.
Though it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the",0.239709,0.923383,19.935374,0.993193,0.229545,4.464241,-3.4413204193115234
"Identify which animal species is alive or extinct: Platybelodon, Lion",", and Crocodylus.

It seems that Platybelodon was the last of the sauropods to go extinct, and it is one of the more recently extinct animals. Lions, crocodiles, and other dinosaurs, such as Stegosaurus and Triceratops, went extinct before Platybelodon, and many other animals such as Triceratops, Allosaurus, and Diplodocus went extinct after Platybelodon.

The Platybelodon was very similar to the Plateosaurus which lived about the same time. Plateosaurus, Platybelodon, and the other sauropods all had a body that was very long compared to their height. Their arms were long and their necks were short. When the Platybelodon lived, it was one of the largest dinosaurs. It was also the last of the sauropods to go extinct.

What's unique about it and why is it famous?,":

paris: 
which is not really Paris, but you can't have Paris. 
A:

I think this answer is correct: paris doesn't sound like a proper noun, and it's not a city name anyway.

A:

I don't think that Paris is normally pronounced pah-reest. I think it's more like
pah-reest
I've never heard anybody pronounce it like that. It is pronounced like Paris in French, but very different from the French pronunciation. So I think it's a different word entirely.
I'm not sure how it got its name. I think, if this is the case, that it's a kind of contraction of two words: Paris-France. But I'm not sure.
If you asked, ""What's unique about it and why is it famous?"". I think the answer would be that it's a city, and it's famous because it's a city.

A:

This is more of a guess, but it may be because paris is a contraction of the phrase paris-france.

In France if you were served le miel what would you eat," the way you would in England.

Thoughtful and fun, the Marseille-based duo have created an interactive map of the world, based on the simple notion that people love to eat food.

The map is divided into countries, continents and regions, with photographs of the dishes that have been most appealing to people. The project was initiated by the pair as a way of getting to know their friends and family better, and it’s already become quite the hit.

The map, which you can even plan your holidays around, has been selected as the top photo project of the year by the online magazine, Photo.net.

The map has already been shared thousands of times, and has been visited by more than 24,000 people.

The project is not only a way of delving into the cultures of different countries, it also serves as a good way to make friends over a meal.

“The Meal Map Project is a fun way to get to know people from different cultures,” say the pair. “We hope it will make travelling easier by showing you what people are craving when they imagine your meals.”

If you’re planning a holiday, or just want to get to know your friends and family better, take a look at the map and try to guess the dishes for yourself.

The Meal Map Project is a fun way to get to know people from different cultures. We hope it will make travelling easier by showing you what people are craving when they imagine your meals.

The project was created by the husband and wife duo, Danielle and Pierre-Luc, who met in their hometown of Marseille, France. They are both self-taught photographers and have a keen interest in food.

“We love to eat and we love to travel so we thought it would be interesting to combine the two,” says Danielle.

“It’s all about people and their tastes, which are really different in each country.”

They created the map to help travellers plan their meals, and to get to know new people.

“We hope the map will help people plan their meals abroad,” says Pierre-Luc. “We wanted to create a map that could be interactive, so that people can add more dishes and try to guess what people are craving.”

The map has been shared thousands of times, and has been visited by more than 24,000 people.

"Let’s solve the following math problem. Each rabbit has 4 feets and each duck has 2 feets. If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?","?

Solution:

25 heads = 4(2) = 8

88 feet = 4(2) + 2 = 12

Therefore, there are 25(8) + 88(12) = 2,125 rabbits and 25(4) + 88(12) = 2,125 ducks.

Percent

Percent is the percent of one quantity relative to another. For example, if one is a pile of letters and the other is a crate of letters, then the percent is the ratio of the number of letters in the pile to the number of letters in the crate. For example, say there are 10 letters in the pile and 10 letters in the crate. The ratio is 10 to 10, or 100%.

Multiply and subtract

Let’s say you have a bag of marbles, and a bag of marbles. If you take out the marbles and put the marbles in the bag, will the bag be full of marbles?

Solution:

No, because you put the marbles into the bag.

Write a subtraction equation

Write the equation for the following:

1. John ate 3 cookies and 5 candy bars. How many cookies did John eat?

Solution:

3(5) – 1(3) = 3(1) = 3

3 cookies = 3(3) = 9

2. Chris ate all the cookies and candy bars. How many candy bars did Chris eat?

Solution:

5(3) = 15

3 (3) – 15 = 0

Add and subtract decimals

Add and subtract decimals by using the same number of decimal places. For example, say you have a number that is 1,000.00, and you want to change the decimal to .01. Make the number a whole number (use the calculator) and use the same number of decimal places as the original number. For example, if the original number was 1,000.00, make it a whole number and enter 001. Your answer is now .01.

Solve for x

Solve the following equation for x.

7x – 8 = 0

Solution:

7x – 8 = –4

7x = –4

Solve for y

Solve the following equation for y.

5y = –3

Solution:

5","Let’s use equations to solve it! 
Let the number of ducks be X and the number of rabbits be Y.
We have X + Y = 25 and 2X + 4Y = 88.
Simplifying the first equation, we get Y = 25 - X
Substitute that in the second equation, we will get 2X + 4(25-X) = 88,
Thus 100 - 2X = 88
Which means 2X = 100 – 88 = 12, thus X = 6.
We substitute back into the first equation, we have Y = 25 - 6 = 19.
There are 6 ducks and 19 rabbits!",0.307305,0.974555,9.722771,0.922953,0.34861,2.455239,-9.90927505493164

Not safe to drink water from a creek or river?

By: Rosalie M. Coffman

Children and adults should be aware of the dangers of drinking water from a creek or river because water can be contaminated by animal wastes and human sewage.

Many people think that water supplies from a creek or river are safe. But even a local stream can be contaminated. The water may be contaminated by animal wastes or human sewage.

Water in streams and rivers is contaminated by animal wastes. Some of these wastes have germs that cause disease. When the water is warm, bacteria multiply quickly. Water in streams and rivers may be contaminated by animals that have died or by people who have thrown garbage into water.

The water in a stream or river may have chemicals or other substances in it. If the water is warm, it may evaporate quickly. The water may evaporate more quickly if it has chemicals in it. Chemicals can dissolve in the water and then come out of the water when it is warm.

The water may have a foul odor. When it has a foul smell, it may be contaminated by foul-smelling gases such as hydrogen sulfide.

Water in a stream or river may have a greenish color. Water may have a greenish color when it has algae in it. When the water is warm, the algae may grow quickly.

Water in a stream or river may have floating objects in it. Fungi and algae can grow on pieces of food that are in the water. These floating objects may be pieces of fish, other animals, or food that someone has thrown into the water.

People should not drink water from a stream or river that looks dirty. When they do, they can get diarrhea.

People should not drink water from a stream or river until they have tested it. They can test the water by putting some of it in a cup and putting the cup in the sunshine. If the water turns yellow, it may be contaminated with a chemical.

People should not drink water from a stream or river that looks clear. If they do, they can get diarrhea. They should not drink the water after it has been in a","No, untreated surface water is typically not safe to drink, as it could contain bacteria or parasites that cause disease.",0.147001,0.9968,31.264033,0.956865,0.160585,6.705057,-4.9791259765625

is a fighting game released for the PlayStation Portable by Namco Bandai Games. It is the first title in the Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes series. The game was ported to other consoles and handhelds.

Gameplay

The game features two-player fighting action and includes a single-player arcade mode which features different gameplay modes. In the arcade mode the players are given 100 challenges, with a maximum of ten points for each challenge. Each player can only complete challenges once, with no limit on how many times they can play the arcade mode. The challenges are based on the story of the Naruto series. Points can be gained and lost as the player progresses through the story mode.

Gameplay for the two-player mode consists of two parts. In the first part, players must defeat the computer-controlled opponents. There are 13 computer-controlled characters in the game, including the Naruto, Sasuke, and Orochimaru characters. The player's character is customizable; players can change their face, hair, skin tone, and clothing. The second half of the two-player mode is a co-op battle where both players must battle the computer-controlled opponents. Co-op mode is controlled by a second player, who can help the main player when they are in danger or give them advice.

Reception

The game received ""mixed or average"" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

What is the difference between Kuchipudi and Kathak dance forms of India?,". When you look at the names of these dance forms, you’ll find that they both derive from Sanskrit words. Kathak has a more complex term which takes in the Sanskrit word kathak, meaning “to dance.” Kuchipudi derives from the Sanskrit word kucchipudi, meaning “to move the body rhythmically.”

While the meanings are similar, there are many differences between the two forms. This is highlighted by the fact that Kathak dance has a long history, whereas Kuchipudi is comparatively a new form. The Kathak dance form has been passed down from generation to generation since the 16th century. Kathak dance is the most popular form of dance in Indian classical dance. Kathak dance is performed on a special stage called a Kathak Mandap, usually dressed in the traditional clothing of the country of origin of the performer.

Kuchipudi dance is a relatively new dance form. It was initially inspired by Kathak dance, but developed over the past 100 years. Kuchipudi has its own Kathak mandap, along with its own style of dance shoes, jewelry, and make-up.

Kuchipudi is performed on a large mat, called the chitra patra, and usually danced with a handkerchief or a fan in the style of Kathak. Kuchipudi has a more relaxed style of movement than Kathak. There is less emphasis on footwork and a slower pace. The music is played on a drum called the chitra, and the dancers are accompanied by a musician playing the harmonium.

Kuchipudi is a very popular dance form in India. It is also performed in other countries around the world, including the United States. Some of the famous dancers in this form include Jasraj, Kishori Amonkar, and Uday Shankar.

"Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned UK for 70 years, passed away the age of 96 at","ely this past weekend.

The Queen is the world’s longest serving monarch, having been reigning since 1952. She was born on April 21, 1926, and was crowned queen upon the death of her father on January 21, 1952.

During her reign, the Queen has faced many challenges. In 1952, the Queen was to be crowned, but the ceremony had to be rescheduled because the Queen of Denmark abruptly cancelled. The Queen was also in charge of her own coronation, which was postponed several times due to the death of her brother, King George VI.

Then, in 2011, the Queen’s eldest son, Prince Charles, suffered a heart attack, and the Queen was forced to cancel her annual summer holiday in Scotland. In 2013, Princess Diana died after a car accident and the Queen was forced to cancel her trip to Australia, which was to be the first time she had traveled outside the UK since 1952.

In addition to her many duties as Queen, the Queen has also taken on many roles as a mother, grandmother, humanitarian and patron of many charities and organizations. She has donated more than 2 million pounds to charity and has worked on many different philanthropic causes.

The Queen is survived by her husband, Prince Philip, her children, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, and her grandchildren.

The Queen’s funeral will be held at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London on Wednesday, April 21, with a private cremation to follow.

Her funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, April 21 at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. While her funeral will be private, the Queen will be laid to rest next to her husband, Prince Philip, in the crypt at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Q:

What is a quantum computer?,"oint.com/what-is-a-quantum-computer-3927.html

You can’t explain quantum computers using traditional methods of computation. They are fundamentally different. And they’ll never be faster than classical computers.

Jump to: navigation, search

Quantum computers will not be capable of solving any problem faster than classical computers. This is because they operate on binary bits.

Mathematically, this means that when a classical computer receives a data string, it will either be a 0 or a 1, and if it is a 1, then it will be that 1 forever. But in a quantum computer, the classical bits are constantly flipping between 0 and 1. The computer is constantly trying to measure the quantum bits, but in the end it can never measure them perfectly.

When you get a classical computer to solve a problem, you can tell it what the problem is, and it will take the correct answer. This is called the solution. On a quantum computer, the solution is unknown. It is not possible to know what the answer is.

Quantum computers will never be able to solve any new problem faster than classical computers.

But can quantum computers do anything well?

Quantum computers can do things that no classical computer can do. And they can do things that a classical computer could do, but would take a long, long time.

For example, a classical computer can do factoring. Factorization is a problem where you divide a number by a number, and you get a different number. For example, if you were trying to divide a number by 2, you would get 1, and if you were trying to divide 3, you would get 2. But a quantum computer can solve factoring by using “quantum error correction.” The error correction algorithm is a mathematical trick that allows the quantum computer to do something that no classical computer could do — to almost completely solve a number.

Quantum computers can simulate quantum systems. This means that they can model new quantum systems. For example, a quantum system would have a certain state, and then you can have a computer run the system. A classical computer could not do this, because if it tried to, it would never be able to find the final state of the system.

A quantum computer can also simulate quantum systems in a real way. This means that it can solve problems that a classical computer can’t. This is because a quantum computer is limited by its ability to solve the","A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.

The basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.

Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence",0.137992,0.999201,22.625828,0.991902,0.149301,4.980845,-4.9733123779296875

"From the paragraph about Space Needle, tell me where is located, when it was built, how tall the monument is and one more tourist fact about it.","l

I am an admirer of Space Needle and I would like to know the height of it. I cannot visit Seattle very often now since the kids are at home. But I would like to know if I were to go back to Seattle, I can still get to the Space Needle. Please tell me how. I would also like to know the year it was built.

Space Needle is the tallest structure in Seattle. It was originally built for the 1962 World's Fair (Seattle World's Fair) and is located at the intersection of Fourth Avenue and Pike Street. It is also the tallest free-standing structure in the world.

The Space Needle was designed by the architects firm of Henry N. Cobb and Associates, and was constructed by the Seattle architectural firm of Graham and Anderson.

I really enjoy reading your posts and learn so much. I would like to know what is the best way to get to the Space Needle from downtown Seattle. Are there any shuttles that stop there?

The Space Needle is located in downtown Seattle on the Pike Street and Fourth Avenue corner.The Space Needle is not accessible by public transportation. You can either take a taxi (very expensive) or take the free ""City Tour"" bus, which stops at the Space Needle.

On the Space Needle web site you can print out a map of the city that includes the Space Needle.Look up the 'Seattle Worlds Fair' in the top left-hand corner of the map. The Space Needle is the tallest structure. It is built on a steel framework that allows it to move up and down as needed.

I would like to know the height of the Space Needle in feet, inches and length. Also, if there is a way to get to the top of the Space Needle without taking the elevator. Is there a ramp on the side of the building? If so, how high is the top of the Space Needle?

No, there is not a ramp on the side of the Space Needle. There are two elevators on each side of the Space Needle. The elevators go to the top of the Space Needle (the observation deck). The observation deck is the highest public observation deck in the world.

The Space Needle is an observation tower that was built for the 1962 World's Fair in Seattle. It is the tallest structure in Seattle.

What is the difference between whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing (WES)?,".
The prevalence of germline genetic variants in families with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition is high, but the real importance of these findings in cancer risk management remains unclear. The recent introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, including whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), has widened the range of putative cancer predisposition genes. Here, we compare the two sequencing strategies and discuss the clinical relevance of rare variants identified by WES and WGS. We retrieved the results of the two studies from the literature and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), respectively, which compared a cohort of breast cancer patients with a control group. We have also retrieved the results from a published study of a cohort of patients with early-onset breast cancer. We identified 79 genes as potentially relevant in cancer predisposition, which were shared between both analyses. Among these, we found mutations in the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genes in 4% and 9% of families, respectively. In addition, we found mutations in putative cancer predisposition genes such as *CHEK2* and *PALB2*, which had not been previously reported. We propose that the clinical significance of the WES and WGS findings should be evaluated in further studies, either to validate the results of the initial studies, or to perform a combined analysis of the results of both sequencing strategies.Q:

Hello there, just became aware of your blog through Google, and found that it is really informative. I’m gonna watch out for brussels. I’ll appreciate if you continue this in future. Many people will be benefited from your writing. Cheers!

I think this is one of the most vital information for me. And i am glad reading your article. But should remark on few general things, The website style is great, the articles is really nice : D. Good job, cheers

Hello, Neat post. There is an issue with your web site in internet explorer, would test this… IE still is the marketplace leader and a large section of other people will miss your fantastic writing due to this problem.

What you have to do is to make a proper analysis of your idea and then make a convincing presentation of it to others. The presentation of your idea will function as a foundation for your speech. When you are done with making the presentation, you will have a strong sense of accomplishment and self-confidence.

I’m impressed, I must say. Seldom do I encounter a blog that’s both educative and entertaining, and let me tell you, you’ve hit the nail on the head. The problem is something that not enough people are speaking intelligently about. I’m very happy that I came across this during my search for something regarding this.

I am just writing to make you be aware of what a magnificent encounter my friend’s princess went through using your web site. She noticed a good number of things, not to mention how it is like to possess a wonderful helping mood to make the mediocre ones smoothly have an understanding of selected problematic topics. You undoubtedly exceeded my desires. Thanks for imparting those insightful, safe, explanatory and in addition cool tips on that topic to Sandra.

Thanks for your publication. I also think that laptop computers have become more and more popular today, and now will often be the only type of computer used in a household. It is because at the same time that they are becoming more and more cost-effective, their processing power is growing to the point where there’re as effective as pc’s dedicated to doing work.

I precisely desired to appreciate you once again. I am not sure what I might have followed without the actual aspects","Since a harpsichord plucks the strings the same way each time in response to a keystroke, it delivers the same loudness for each note. A piano on the other hand uses padded hammers to strike the strings, and allows the musician to control each strike in such a way that they have control over the dynamics of each note. This control allows pianists to express a broad range of emotions by adjusting the loudness and softness according to the feelings they want to convey to the listener.",0.506079,0.582324,0.602007,0.708819,0.490745,0.577995,-5.684496879577637

The present invention relates to a semiconductor device including an interposer for interconnecting a plurality of semiconductor chips, and to a multi-chip module (MCM) including the semiconductor device.
A semiconductor chip is mounted on a circuit substrate such as a printed circuit board, and the circuit substrate is connected to a motherboard for example. The mounting of the semiconductor chip on the circuit substrate is called face-down mounting. To mount the semiconductor chip on the circuit substrate in the face-down mounting, it is necessary to electrically connect terminals of the semiconductor chip to terminals of the circuit substrate. For this purpose, an interposer is used.
In the face-down mounting, a plurality of semiconductor chips are mounted on the same circuit substrate. In this case, the plurality of semiconductor chips have the same shape as the semiconductor chip mounted on the circuit substrate. Therefore, a plurality of semiconductor chips on the same circuit substrate are referred to as a multi-chip module (MCM).
The printed circuit board is connected to the motherboard by connectors. Examples of the connectors include a SIL connector, a QFP connector and a PGA connector. The SIL connector, the QFP connector and the PGA connector are formed by stacking","- New Zealand

It was the scene of several key events of the American Revolution and the nation's founding, such as the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, and the siege of Boston. Upon American independence from Great Britain, the city continued to be an important port and manufacturing hub as well as a center for education and culture.

The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch.

"Given the paragraph about the Colnago C40, in which year was a Colnago-branded bicycle first ridden by the overall classification winner in the Tour de France?","I think it was in 1989. I don't know, I haven't got it in front of me

The 1989 Tour de France was the first to run over the entire length of the French Alps -- 2,800 kms -- so a Colnago C40 would have been a good bike to ride.

I've had a C40 for a year or two now, it's my first road bike and I love it. My first impressions are that it's pretty light (I can't remember offhand what my current weight is) but it also feels like a proper road bike. It's a great bike with which to learn.

I also love that it's a bit more expensive than other bikes I've tried and I'm sure I'll keep it for a long time.

how to make scroll-view fit into the screen in android

I have a scrollview and i want to fit it into the screen, so that the entire scrollview should be visible at a time and the screen should scroll only when i scroll the scrollview.
I have used some examples but they did not fit the screen, so that i see only the scrollview.
Please help me in this regard.

A:

You can use the android:fillViewport=""true"" attribute in your ScrollView.
This can be use within a RelativeLayout, LinearLayout, etc...
See the documentation here.

You could use the android:preserveScrollPosition=""true"" attribute on your ScrollView to make it scroll with the screen content, so when you scroll the content, the scrollView should scroll too.

A technical expert, in-house or vendor, considers it an engineering problem, while a business user needs it to have a business impact.  Multiple frameworks can help build consensus.  However, an ideal approach will go through these steps.
1. Identify a business outcome.  This is a very high-level outcome that is industry aligned and has no technical description.  An example from the healthcare industry is a 'better patient experience.'
2. List strategies defined by an organisation to deliver these outcomes.  To our example in step 1, one approach is reducing patient wait time when attending a hospital.'
3. Clarify the KPIs and measurements listed in these strategies.  In this example, it can be 'Max patient wait time of 20 mins'. 
4. List business capabilities that can deliver results towards these KPIs.  Here we can think of ways patients can register their details electronically on their own or hospital devices vs paper forms.  Each entry will initiate an automated process to assign the right staff and resources to address patient needs.
5. Build technical capabilities that",0.634799,0.953474,18.577273,0.984736,0.658234,4.361703,-6.170962810516357

It can seem overwhelming to take the first step. A good way to learn is to start with a small, easy project (eg: adding 2 numbers and showing the result) and build on it. Important to keep in mind is coding languages are just languages. So there is a structure and a set of rules to them. Once you start getting a feel for this, it gets easier to learn more quickly. In fact, coding languages are much simpler than languages we humans use to talk to each other :)

Why was America called the New World?,"an

A:

In the Middle Ages, North America was known as the ""New World"" because it was the newest place that Europeans had discovered, compared to the rest of the world.  The true origin of the name is unknown, although there are many theories.  One theory is that it comes from the fact that the natives of the Americas were less advanced than the people of Europe.  Another theory is that the name comes from the fact that many European explorers felt ""new world"" to be a better name for the newly discovered land.

A:

It was named America because it was the New World.

"How would you categorize the following sports into two groups; baseball, archery, decathlon, hockey",", and so on?

A:

You have many different sports, and they all have different concepts. For example, baseball is a game played between two teams, the batters and the pitchers. Archery is a sport where you hit a target, and hockey is a sport played on ice, with sticks and skates.
Decathlon is a sport where you combine four sports: swimming, running, throwing and jumping. I don't know archery, so I can't say anything about that.
Especially if you're a beginner, you'd better stick with one sport.

Give me a bulleted list with 5 reasons why is Lyft's stock is underperforming Uber's.," is a peer-to-peer ride-sharing service that lets you request rides from drivers in your area. Instead of working with a traditional taxi company, you'll work directly with drivers, who are rated by their passengers and pay them a fee for each ride.Lyft's conclusion is that the stock's valuation is too high, and that the company has a long way to go before it can match up to Uber. The stock is trading at a market capitalization of $12.4 billion, while Uber trades at a market cap of $71.5 billion. The two companies have different business models -- Lyft is a ride-sharing app, while Uber is a ride-hailing app -- but Lyft's stock is underperforming Uber's by a wide margin.

The Motley Fool is fan of Lyft, but it's not a fan of investors who think the ride-hailing app is overvalued. Lyft's current valuation is too high, and while the company is growing quickly, it's not nearly as fast as Uber. Lyft is still chasing a big market opportunity, but investors should be wary of what Uber has already accomplished.The present invention relates generally to the field of optical devices and, more specifically, to the field of optical waveguides.
Optical waveguides are fundamental components of optical systems. Optical waveguides may be fabricated from a variety of materials and may be used to guide light in a variety of applications. Optical waveguides may be constructed using a variety of techniques. For example, optical waveguides may be constructed using on-chip lithography techniques (i.e., lithography that is performed using a mask) or by using bulk micromachining techniques.
The present invention is directed to optical waveguides that are constructed using bulk micromachining techniques. Bulk micromachining techniques enable the fabrication of optical waveguides having very small diameters. Optical waveguides constructed using bulk micromachining techniques are also able to support a high density of optical devices, because they do not require complex fabrication techniques.
In bulk micromachining techniques, an optical waveguide is formed by forming a trench in the substrate, depositing a waveguide material in the trench, and then removing the substrate from the waveguide. The trench is typically formed using a variety of techniques. For example, the waveguide material may be deposited using a laser ablation technique, a chemical vapor deposition technique, or a physical vapor deposition technique. The waveguide material may be deposited by","The following are 5 reasons Lyft's stock is underperforming Uber's:

How can I decide what bike I should get?,"er:So I have a few bikes that I am thinking about getting. One is a Giant Trance. Another is a Giant Revenge. I like the Trance because of the one hand brakes, but the Revenge has a better suspension. My third bike is a Giant Rush, which doesn't have a suspension. Which one do you think I should get?

I don't get why a lot of people like the Trance. I have one and it could be great for a great bike, but for me it's not. It's a horrible bike to ride on rough ground.

I've had a few Giant bikes and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. The biggest thing that I've noticed is that the Trance and Revenge are not the best bikes for mountaineering. I can't comment on the Rush, because I don't have one.

I got the Trance and love it. I agree that it's a bad bike to ride on rough ground and it's not the best for climbing, but it's great for the trails I ride. It's a great all around trail bike, which is what I was looking for.

My friend just got a Trance and is really happy with it. It's a great all around bike.

I actually had a Trance last year and I have to agree with the others. I thought the bike rode pretty well but it just didn't have the suspension to climb the hills we found in the St. George area. I sold it and bought a Pinarello Dogma. I love that bike.

I really liked the Trance. My first bike was a Giant Reign. While I loved it it had some shortcomings as well. I sold that bike and got the Giant Trance. The Trance is a god's send of a bike and I can't imagine anything better out there.

I'd buy it. I've had the Trance and it's a great all around bike. The one thing that I didn't like about it was the suspension. I never had a problem with the suspension in the Revenge, but it was a little harsh in the Trance.

I bought a Revenge and really liked it. The only downside was the suspension was a little harsh. The Trance I think is a great bike. I'm going to be getting a Trance this year and I'm glad I waited. I think it will be worth the wait.

I have","When it comes to bicycles for adults, there are different kinds available in the market. Select a bike based on how you'd like to use it. Bikes can be categorized as follows:
1. Road bikes - These bikes have super thin tires and are often used for biking on roads. These help you attain high speeds relatively quickly.
2. Mountain bikes - These bikes are made to sustain the rough terrain that you could come across while biking. The tires are much thicker made to protect you and give you the support you need.
3. Hybrid/Commuter bikes - These bikes fall into the middle of the above 2 categories. If you think you might do a bit of road biking and mountain biking, then this might be your best option.

How do I do a headstand?,"s with a 3-8″ base, and so they have been really difficult for me to master. My yoga instructor suggested that I try doing this pose while standing on my head.

While I was standing on my head, I experienced a lot of nausea, dizziness, and even some vertigo, but the nausea was very mild, and I actually felt more awake than usual. My head felt like it was spinning on the ground, but it wasn’t spinning. I noticed that my neck was a little strained, but it wasn’t painful, and I easily returned to standing. I also noticed that I was able to breathe a little easier, which was surprising.

I didn’t do this pose while standing on my head for very long, but I did notice that I felt more awake and was able to concentrate better. I’m not going to do this pose again, but I will try it again sometime in the future.

I’m also not really sure if this pose is very beneficial at all, but I’m going to keep it in my daily practice.

What’s your favorite headstand?

Have you tried sitting in a headstand before?

Do you like doing headstands, or do you avoid them?

What’s your favorite yoga pose?

About Taylor

I'm a twenty-something graduate student in a small city in the northwestern United States. I love to read, write, travel, play the piano, and work on my own writing. I'm currently looking for something to do with my writing degree and love to read about other people's writing projects.

I’ve never tried to do a headstand. It’s probably because I’m terrified of heights. I did a handstand once when I was 18, and it was hard enough, but when I tried to stand on my head, I just felt like I was going to throw up. I think I’ll stick with what I know.

I had a friend who would do headstands (or “stands” as he called them) occasionally while we were on the soccer field, but I never tried it myself because I was always freaked out about the possibility of falling.

China's decision will only further isolate Taiwan, said Lee Chia-fen, a pro-independence Taiwanese legislator.

""China is now using legal means to further its military and economic encirclement of Taiwan,"" Lee told the Global Times on Tuesday, calling Taiwan a ""free and open country.""

Lee's comments come as China is continuing to cede more land to Taiwan in the run-up to the island's presidential and legislative elections next month, which will determine whether the island's democratically-elected chief executive, Ma Ying-jeou, may be allowed to stay in office.

Ma is the first president of the island to be elected after the return of a mainland Communist Party chief to power in China in 2012.

The announcement of the establishment of a new administrative region in northeastern China's Jilin province on Tuesday has triggered a wave of angry comments from pro-independence Taiwanese lawmakers.

""It is hard to believe that the Chinese Communist Party would be so reckless as to expose its military preparations for Taiwan,"" said Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Lee Yu-chung, in a Facebook post. ""I believe that the Chinese Communist Party will pay a heavy price for its move.""

Taiwan is a self-ruled island of 23 million people, with a democratic government that has been ruled for more than seven decades by the Kuomintang (KMT) party of Ma.

China's decision to unilaterally establish a new administrative region in the northeastern province of Jilin is a retaliatory move due to Ma's ""Taiwan independence"" policy, analysts have said.

""China's decision to create a new administrative region in Jilin proves that China is intent on pursuing the Taiwan independence policy of the KMT,"" said William Nee, a China expert at the University of Nottingham. ""If Ma Ying-jeou and his party continue to pursue such a policy, Taiwan will continue to be isolated.""

The DPP legislator Lee also said that the Chinese Communist Party's move would lead to the ""erosion of Taiwan's sovereignty.""

""This is the latest case of the Chinese Communist Party's encroachment on Taiwan's sovereignty, which is a direct challenge to democratic rule in Taiwan,"" Lee said.

China's decision to create a new administrative region in Jilin will intensify the cross-strait tensions, said Chang H",The whole world cannot be split into two countries because it would be impossible to maintain the balance of power between the two countries.,0.17641,0.999593,3.207128,0.99904,0.15259,1.106952,-5.0230488777160645

Where can you find Anostraca?,".org/id/d1gZs9z9o0.aspx

In my experience, the best place to look for them is where I live, in the Midlands of England. The large towns (particularly Burton-upon-Trent) have them. I pick up a few every year, and have had a few species of them in my garden. They’re pretty small, so it’s a good place to look for them.

I’m sorry, but I’d have to strongly disagree with you. No matter how much you like Anostraca, it’s a plant. It’s not a critter. If you’re going to try to classify them as “bugs”, then you have to accept that. And I don’t believe in classifying them as “bugs”.

Anostraca is my favorite taxon. Ever since I was a kid I was fascinated by the incredible diversity of these guys. I have a large collection of them still living in my office. I have to go in there and remember that they are no longer living.

I have a question about a new species I found, a dark brown specimen. It is in my office. The first naturalist I showed it to said it was a plant. It may be a plant, but it is definitely not a plant. It has 4 or 5 valves, and no leaf. It has a thick stem and a large root system. The roots are very thick and grow up to 4 feet. They are attached to the ground. It is a very robust plant. It is also very slow growing. It is around a year old now. I purchased it at a local garden center.

I have been keeping it in a mix of potting soil and vermiculite. It does seem to be getting larger. The larger it gets the more roots it produces. It is eating the potting soil and the vermiculite. Should I repot it? It has a thick root system, so I don’t want to disturb its roots.

I would be careful with this, because it is an exceptional specimen. I’m not sure it should be transplanted. I’d leave it in the pot and let it continue growing, and see what happens. If it gets too large, I’d have to repot.

It is still growing, but just slowly. It is about 2 feet tall and 4 feet long. It is","The crustaceans Anostraca can be be found in vernal pools and hypersaline lakes, as well as deserts, ice-covered mountain lakes and Antarctic ice.",0.627558,0.995388,19.432326,0.979928,0.685633,4.544167,-4.640878200531006

The economics of neural development.
Recent developments in neuroscience have begun to elucidate the complex relationship between the genetic programs that guide the development of the nervous system and the molecules that control its function. The ability to harness this knowledge has the potential to enable a new generation of treatments for neural disorders. This review outlines some of the key molecular pathways that control the development of the nervous system. It describes some of the key molecules that regulate neuronal development, and how their expression can be manipulated to induce gain of function phenotypes. These include the use of the transcription factors used to reprogram adult cells to become neural cells; the use of transcription factors that drive the expression of proteins that alter the activity of specific neural cell types; and the use of proteins that can be used to control neuronal cell-fate decisions. These approaches could provide a powerful means of reversing or even blocking the effects of neurological disease. A better understanding of the processes that control neuronal development will enable us to effectively manipulate neural development to cure neural disorders.The present invention is directed to a device for determining the position of a movable part in a reactor vessel.

What is multipass distillation?

Multipass distillation is the process of condensing hydrocarbon vapor by passing vapor through a series of condenser tubes.

Multipass distillation is a process to condense hydrocarbons in refinery processes, such as the dehydration or deasphalting of crude oils. It is also used in petroleum production to separate and recover desired chemicals from other components of crude oil.

Multipass distillation",Multipass distillation is taking water and distilled it hundreds of times per gallon made by ultra heating and cooling the water many times per minute.  This action itself will change the bond angle of water from 104 degrees which is traditional tap water to 114 degrees.  This bond angle change is a permanent change to the produced multi-pass distilled water.  It has properties that can heal the body similar to stream water coming down a mountain which usually has a bond angle around 108 degrees.,0.348341,0.950857,20.830632,0.992948,0.318739,4.688303,-4.2142462730407715

Please describe what Business Process Mapping is and why it is used

So business process mapping is a technique that is used to identify and document the business processes that are used in an organisation, and it does this by firstly performing a standardised analysis and definition of the business processes, once the business processes are defined, they are then mapped to the underlying systems so that we can then identify the business logic that is associated with them, and we can then identify any gaps in the business processes that might be associated with the business logic, this is done by looking at the business process and asking the question “what is the business goal of this business process”, so that we can then identify any gaps or areas that might be missing from the business process, and then we can then develop a standardised model of the business process, which we will be looking at later

So once we have the business process model, we can then develop the architecture solution, which we will also be looking at later

So we can then look at the technical solution that would be used to implement the business process model, and we will be looking at the data model that would be used to support the business process model

Mapping is usually performed using visual tools that use standardized shapes to indicate entities.  Mapping involves capturing activities, the roles performing the activities, systems and tools used to execute the activities and inputs and outputs from the activities.  Process mapping is frequently conducted in cross functional workshops with a facilitator capturing the activities performed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).  Common uses of process mapping include:

Give me a comma separated list of nicknames given to Dan Campbell and who gave him the nickname,".

A:

It's actually a lot easier.  I'll assume you're using a MySQL database.
Step 1: Get the nicknames of all the users.  Just use a select query to find out all the nicknames given to each user.  This query will return an array of all the nicknames given to each user.
select userid from users where nick = 'patrick';

Step 2: Now you want to do a join of the nicknames table to the users table.
select u.userid, u.nick from users u join nicknames n on n.nick = u.nick

Step 3: Now you can get the nickname of a given user by doing a simple comparison between the 'nick' column of the nicknames table and the user's 'nick' column in the users table.
select u.userid, u.nick from users u join nicknames n on n.userid = u.userid
where n.nick = 'patrick';

The chosen design was designed by Utzon to be in the form of a 4-pointed star, and Utzon's design was chosen because it was a boat-shaped building, which would allow it to be seen from most parts of the city.

How many different forms was the Sydney Opera House first designed?

The first architect to design the Sydney Opera House was Jorn Utzon, and Utzon designed the Sydney Opera House in the form of a 4-pointed star.

What are the main features of the Sydney Opera House?

The main features of the Sydney Opera House are the sails, the roof, and the theatre hall. The sails of the Sydney Opera House are made out of glass, and they are meant to symbolise the sails of a ship. The roof of the Sydney Opera House is made of glass as well, and the roof is a geodesic dome that is meant to symbolise the sails of a ship. The theatre hall is a unique feature of the Sydney Opera House, and it is a space that is made up of three levels. The first level is the orchestra level, and it is a level that is meant to give the people of Sydney a chance to see the stage from where they are sitting. The second level is the main theatre level, and it is a level that is meant to be seen from the first level by the people who are watching the performance. The third level is the balcony level, and it is a balcony level that is meant for the people who are seated in the third level to see the performances.

What is the Opera House Theatre Hall, and how big is it?

The Opera House Theatre Hall is a unique feature of the Sydney Opera House. The theatre hall is a","The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.

Designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon, but completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.

The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.",0.092334,0.997127,13.695648,0.98825,0.1034,3.175352,-4.3571014404296875

What is the first computer recognized in human history?,".net.cn

A:

I don't think that's a definitive answer.
A human brain is a parallel processor, and we aren't sure exactly how it does it, but we know that it must be a parallel processor because it is able to learn new things and adapt to new circumstances without becoming obsolete. That's how our brains work. 
Computer architecture is a lot like biological architecture, except we don't think it is.

This paper addresses the problem of how to select the best actions for a given decision problem. In particular, this paper focuses on the problem of decision making under uncertainty. Traditional approaches to decision making under uncertainty have included, among others, Bayesian methods, belief-based methods, and model-based methods. These approaches represent the three main streams of research in this field. However, each of these approaches has limitations, and in recent years, more and more attention has been paid to model-free approaches, also known as “algorithms without rules”. This paper proposes a new model-free algorithm for decision making under uncertainty, which is an extension of the algorithm of Littman and Witten, which we refer to as the Littman-Witten Algorithm (LWA).

What is DevSecOps?,".in/devsecops

DevSecOps is a new, more integrated approach to security that brings together security teams and software developers to help maintain the security of the software before it is released to production.

How does DevSecOps work?

In DevSecOps, the security team and the software development team work together to ensure that the software is secure before it is released to production.

This is done by practicing Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Testing, and Continuous Monitoring.

Continuous Integration means that both teams practice Continuous Integration, which means that the code is checked in to version control very frequently. This speeds up the process of producing quality software by preventing regressions and detecting bugs faster.

Continuous Deployment means that both teams practice Continuous Deployment, which means that the code is almost continuously deployed to production. This ensures that the software is secure as soon as it is released, and makes it easier to rollback changes if they are found to be insecure.

Continuous Testing means that both teams practice Continuous Testing, which means that the software is constantly tested for security and quality. This makes it possible to detect and fix bugs faster, and ensures that the software is secure when it is released to production.

Continuous Monitoring means that both teams practice Continuous Monitoring, which means that the software is constantly monitored for security vulnerabilities. This makes it possible to quickly fix security vulnerabilities before they can cause problems.

The DevSecOps approach is based on the YAGNI principle, which means ""you aren't going to need it"".

This means that security flaws that are found in the software are fixed before they become serious security problems. This reduces the time and effort that is needed to create secure software.

How is DevSecOps different from Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Testing, and Continuous Monitoring?

Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, Continuous Testing, and Continuous Monitoring are all different types of Continuous Integration, and all these methods are used together to ensure that the software is secure before it is released to production.

However, these methods are not the same.

For example, Continuous Integration is a continuous integration method, which means that it is a method that is practiced by both the software development and the security teams.

However, Continuous Deployment is a continuous deployment method, which means that it is a method that is practiced by only the software development team.

DevSecOps is a more integrated approach",DevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps with security integrated into the DevOps approach. It has been growing in recent years as producing secure software is becoming a top priority for companies.,0.669283,0.998852,20.487397,0.992677,0.718,4.773242,-5.4185075759887695
What is the square root of 25?," three times a day, and you'll feel better.

To understand what the first two lines are trying to say, think of a number on the scale from 1 to 10. You know what the number is, but you don't know how much it weighs. Taking the number as a whole, you can't tell how much it weighs. The problem is that it depends on where you set the scale.

The idea of a number on the scale is very common. It's the kind of simple idea that you can use to describe many situations. For example, the expression ""the square root of 25"" is a way to describe the weight of a number on the scale. A number on the scale is a number on the number line. It's a number on the number line that has a weight.

The number lines we draw in the sand are called number lines. They show the numbers that go on the scale. A number line shows a number on the number line from the smallest number you can think of to the largest.

A number line has a number on it from 1 to 10. On a number line, the number on the left is the number 1. The number on the right is the number 10. Here's a picture of a number line with numbers in it:

What is the mascot of Stanford University?,"

Stanford University is the mascot of Stanford University. The original name was ""Stanford Cardinal"", which was inspired by the Stanford University mascot (the Stanford Cardinal). He was created by John Stanford's son, John Jr., who also made the Stanford Cardinal.

The name was changed to ""Cardinal"" in 1911, after the team's first victory over the Southern California football team. The name was dropped in 1951, though the team continued to use the name until 1997.

Stanford's ""Cardinal"" mascot today is not a cardinal bird, but rather a Stanford student, known as ""Stanford Cardinal"".

""The Cardinal"" is the official name of the team and the mascot is ""Cardinal"". The club mascot is ""Stanford Cardinal"". In the past, the mascot was ""The Cardinal"", but in 1997 the university dropped ""Stanford"".<testcase>

"A group of friends and putting together a D&D group and would like a balance of ranged and melee character classes. Here are the classes they are considering:  Ranger, Rogue, Fighter, Barbarian, Monk, Warlock, Paladin, and Wizard. Please create a dot point list of Ranged and Melee classes in alphabetical order, so that I can share that with my friends.",":

I can provide more detail if needed. Thanks in advance.

A:

I'm going to let my group decide based on their own preferences.
Personally, I think the Barbarian is the best class for melee, and the Wizard is the best class for ranged.  I also think that the Wizard, Rogue, and Fighter are all good choices.
Depending on how you divide up the roles, you might want to consider the Barbarian and the Mage.  Mages can be ranged or melee, so you could make a Mage a Ranged class and a Barbarian a Melee class.  I think that the Rogue is one of the better ranged classes, but I don't think it's perfect.  The Rogue is a very good close combat fighter, but it's not very good at ranged combat.  The Fighter is a good all-rounder and can be good at ranged or melee combat, depending on the situation.  Dwarves are good at melee, but not at ranged.  Mages don't have a good melee class, and Barbarians are weak melee classes (though they can be good ranged).
You should make sure to note that these are just my preferences.  If you want to be really picky, you could make a Fighter/Rogue/Barbarian/Mage and then have the Rogue and Barbarian be melee and the Fighter and Mage be ranged.  However, that would make all of the classes very weak melee classes, and I would not recommend it.  If your friends are picky, you can make them more specific.
Of course, if you have a lot of people, you can decide that one person is the ranged fighter, one is the melee fighter, one is the ranged fighter, and one is the melee fighter.  (Or, if you have fewer people, you could make one person be the ranged fighter, the other person be the melee fighter, and you could split the rest of the classes between them.)

A:

The most important thing is that you have a balance of all classes.
I am a Rogue, Barbarian, and Wizard.
I usually prefer to be a ranged fighter.  The Barb is a good melee fighter, but I have performed better with ranged attacks.  The Wizard is a good ranged fighter, but is not as good at me","Below is the breakdown of classes, listed in alphabetical order in Melee and Ranged groups.

","Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot.

The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and",0.702314,0.228292,0.925161,0.761604,0.702534,0.663981,-16.461816787719727

A 66-year-old man was sentenced to more than five years in prison today after admitting to kicking a cat to death, causing it to suffer for a day and a half before it died.

William Grant of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty Tuesday to killing the cat, named “Pudge,” after its owners, Edward and Lisa Zwolenski, reported it missing.

The Zwolenski’s attorney, Frank W. Lombardi, told the Associated Press that Grant had “a long history of kicking animals.” He said Grant also kicked their dog, and Grant’s stepfather’s dog, whose name was also Pudge.

Grant’s stepfather, Robert Grant, told the Associated Press that he came home and found the cat “laying on the floor with blood all over it.” The cat was later found in a trash can.

The Zwolenski’s attorney said Pudge didn’t appear to have any injuries on it when the family first saw it. But when they returned later that day, they found the cat “kicking and kicking,” the attorney said.

The cat’s owners didn’t report it missing for two days because they thought it might have been hit by a car, he said.","Sure.

This is an oft repeated claim, but I've yet to see a concrete example of how
this is the case. How does open source _make_ proprietary projects cheaper?

~~~
simonh
You don't need to make a proprietary project cheaper to make open source
projects cheaper.

If you're using a company that is big enough to pay for a lot of open source
projects, then the more people working on that company's proprietary
programmer's time, the less they need to pay programmers to work on open
source projects.

The reverse is also possible. The more your proprietary company needs
programmers, the more you'll pay them for open source projects.

One of the things that I really like about open source software is that it
allows me to choose between a wide variety of solutions and pick the one that
works best for me.

I used to be a big fan of proprietary software too, but I've come to realize
that it's usually a bad deal for the user and an even worse deal for the
company that makes it.

I agree that open source allows users to choose from a wide variety of
solutions.

But do you think that is a good thing or a bad thing? I think it's a bad
thing.

I can't think of a situation where open source is a better deal for the user.

What I'm saying is that in the long run, open source tends to be a much
slower and more expensive development path. The software is developed by a
handful of people who will constantly battle for code control and access. The
software developers are also constantly fighting for the user's attention and
their dollars.

I think that is a much better path than",Open source is so important because it allows developers to contribute their skills and ideas to coding projects in the programming community.

What are the best Japanese RPGs to try out?,".

I like to play 1st person RPGs in Japanese, and I know some of the best ones in the west. Also, it's easy to get started with one of the many VNs that are available.

I'd say Rhapsody, Tales of the Abyss, and Knights in the Nightmare are all great examples of great Japanese RPGs.

Rhapsody is a great example of a turn based RPG, where you progress through the game. It has a lot of interesting characters, and the story is pretty good. Rhapsody is one of the only games that I can say has really captured my attention for the past 8 years.

Tales of the Abyss is another good example. It's a little more of a hack and slash RPG, and has a lot of interesting characters. The story is a little better than Rhapsody, but not by much.

Knights in the Nightmare is a more traditional RPG, and tells the story of a young man who is involved in a war against a race known as the Nephilim. It's a great story, and there are a lot of cool characters in this game.

I'd say that you should try out Tales of Symphonia, which is a great example of a hack and slash RPG. It's pretty much the same style as Tales of the Abyss, but it has a lot more characters in it.

My personal favorite is the recently released Xenoblade Chronicles. I was not sure what to expect from it, but I have to say it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played. There are a lot of cool characters, and it has some really great music.

The normal combat in Xenoblade is still the same, but you can switch between two characters to control different parts of the story. And the story is pretty good, and the characters are interesting.

The only downside to Xenoblade is that the game crashes every once in a while. But, it's not that common, and it's still a great game.

Xenoblade is a current release. It's very rare to find it in stores, but it's well worth the money.

I'd say one of the best RPGs I've played is the latest Fire Emblem. I love the story, and the gameplay is really good. It's a lot better than Xenoblade, but the story is still pretty good","JRPGs have been around since the late 80s and hence there are a lot of options to try out.

How to pass a variable to the city name when using pgr_dijkstra

I am currently working on a passenger flow application using pgr_dijkstra. However, I am struggling with passing the city name in the query string to my pgr_dijkstra function.
I am using the following query to find the shortest path between two stations with a given starting and ending point.
SELECT * FROM

pgr_dijkstra(
    'SELECT g.id, s.id, s.city, s.state, s.name, s.lat, s.lon,
    ST_Distance(g.start, s.lat, s.lon) AS distance
    FROM stations s
    JOIN nodes n ON (n.id = s.id)
    JOIN way w ON (w.id = n.id)
    JOIN edges e ON (e.source = w.id)
    JOIN graph g ON (g.id = e.id_1)
    WHERE s.name = ?',
    array( $start ),
    array( $end ))

But I am struggling to pass the city name to the pgr_dijkstra function.
I am using the following code to pass the city name to the pgr_dijkstra function.
$city_name = $node['city'];

Here's how I am calling the function.
$path_array = pgr_dijkstra($sql, $start, $end, $city_name);

I know that $city_name is being passed because the function works when I am passing the $start and $end parameters without the city name. It also works when I am passing the city name and the $start and $end parameters. However, $city_name is not being passed when I am passing the $start and $end parameters along with the $city_name.
Does anyone know how to pass the city name to the pgr_dijkstra function?

What is the Pareto principle?,"

Hi,
I am doing a project on Pareto principle. I spend about 3 days in doing this. My teacher told me that ""Pareto Principle is based on the idea of ​​80/20 rule. This shows that a lot of people will benefit if a small number of people can do something well.""
But I am not sure that I completely understand the meaning of the 80/20 rule. Can anyone please explain this to me?

A:

In a nutshell, the Pareto principle is a law of nature that states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. The 20% of the causes are also called top-N causes.
A very important detail is that this is not a law about what is the largest value of a variable. The Pareto principle only applies to distributions of variables, and not to distributions of values.
Essentially, if you have a variable $X$, you can find the top-N causes of the variable $X$ by finding the set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on the observed variable $Y$.
For example, if you have a variable $X$ with a normal distribution, then the Pareto principle can be applied to it by finding the set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on the observed variable $Y$.
The set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on the observed variable $Y$ is:
$$C = \{\text{all the causes which contribute more than 80% to the total effect of $X$ on $Y$}\}$$
This is also the set of all the causes $C$ that are responsible for more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on $Y$.
The set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on $Y$ is:
$$C = \{\text{all the causes which contribute more than 80% to the total effect of $X$ on $Y$}\}$$
The set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total effect of $X$ on $Y$ is not the set of all the causes $C$ which contribute more than 80% of the total value of","The Pareto principle also known as the 80/20 rule or the law of the vital few, states that roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.

"Given this paragraph about Grumpy Cat, tell me the cat's real name.","inAbout learning a languageA virus is a piece of information, or data, that is passed between different computers or devices through a network. A virus is not a piece of software, but a bundle of instructions that gets executed in the infected computer. Once the virus is in your computer, it can spread with any file you open, send, and receive.

When a computer gets a virus, it becomes infected with a tiny piece of software that allows it to spread the virus to other computers. The virus can enter a computer by coming into contact with a program that will execute the virus, and then infecting the whole computer. The virus can also spread through email, instant messaging programs, or any other type of network.

When a computer is infected with a virus, it causes a lot of problems. It can be very difficult to repair the computer, and sometimes the computer will stop working altogether. The virus can also spread to other computers, infecting other computers and causing them to have problems.

A virus can also cause a lot of damage to the computer, and it can even damage the hard drive. A virus can also steal things from your computer and send them to someone else.

Types of Virus

There are many different types of viruses. Viruses that spread through email can be called email viruses, because they spread through email. Viruses that spread through instant messaging can be called instant messaging viruses, because they spread through instant messaging.

There are also viruses that spread through the Internet, called network viruses, because they spread through the Internet. Viruses that spread through USB ports can be called USB viruses, because they spread through USB ports.

There are also viruses that spread through other types of communication, called non-network viruses, because they spread in other types of communication. Viruses that spread through digital cameras and printers can be called digital camera viruses, because they spread through digital cameras and printers. There are also viruses that don't spread at all, called boot sector viruses, because they start at the computer's boot sector.

There are also viruses that are designed to cause other types of damage, like computer worms. Worms are programs that spread automatically, but they don't infect any other programs.

The clinical and genetic spectrum of LIPH deficiency.
Recent biochemical and genetic studies have revealed that the lipoma at various loci on chromosome 1q12 is a common and important genetic disorder. Here we present a summary of the clinical and laboratory findings in nine patients with lipoma locus 1 (LIPH) deficiency. The diagnosis was established by biochemical analysis of LIPH deficiency in eight patients and mutation analysis of LIPH in one. Clinically, all patients had facial lipomatosis with severe pre- and/or postnatal respiratory embarrassment. In several cases, severe visual impairment was also present. Biochemical analysis revealed elevated levels of triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B in five patients. Three patients showed hypolipoproteinemia. All patients had markedly reduced LIPH activity. In one patient, LIPH deficiency was caused by a novel mutation resulting in a premature stop codon. In the other eight patients, the molecular defects were not determined. The results of this study point to the importance of the lipoma locus 1 for lipid metabolism.

Who is Marshall Strickland,"?

Marshall Strickland, a 64-year-old man from the town of Roseville, signed a “Tea Party” petition in 2011, but he wasn’t really aware of what he was signing. His name was simply one of more than 100,000 names listed on the petition.

Strickland is an unemployed auto worker who has been divorced for more than 30 years. He says he’s never been politically active, and that he signed the petition as a joke.

“I didn’t know what it was. I just signed it. I didn’t know what it was I signed. It just said ‘Tea Party.’ I thought it was a joke. I didn’t know what it was,” said Strickland.

He says he and a friend found the petition and decided to sign it. “I was just signing it. I didn’t know what it was.”

Strickland says he never read the actual petition, but he did look into the Tea Party, which he says he had never heard of. He thinks he signed the petition because he was “looking for something to do.”

“It’s a joke. I don’t even know what it is,” said Strickland.

The Tea Party is not a real political party, but rather a grassroots movement that encourages people to participate in politics. Some of its members have been known to dress in period costumes during protests. However, the Tea Party does have a national headquarters in Colorado Springs, and the organization has been known to support candidates who are in favor of smaller government.

The Tea Party petition, which was created in 2011, was not designed for people like Strickland. The petition had tens of thousands of signatures, and the organizers of the Tea Party asked that the names be kept confidential.

But after the Tea Party petition received so much attention, a man named Kory Watkins got an email from a woman in California asking for help with a legal battle. The California woman said she was the widow of the guy who created the Tea Party petition, and she was seeking legal action against Watkins.

She said Watkins had “stolen” her husband’s name and signed the petition under it. Watkins was not aware that the petition was a joke at the time he signed it.

Watkins said he was just trying to help the woman.

“She was like, ‘I need your help. I’m in a legal battle and I","Marshall Strickland (born March 1, 1983) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball at Indiana University for four years from 2002 to 2006.

"Based on this article, how did the existence of trains impact the development of Roche Percee?",".com

This is an interesting question. I'm not sure the impact was positive or negative, but I'll explain my reasoning.

From the outset, trains were essential for the development of Roche Percee. To start with, the population at this time was quite small. This, in turn, meant that the more people who had to travel from one point to another, the more people were likely to congregate, which could lead to boatloads of people coming to a city, which could lead to overcrowding and chaos. To combat this, trains were introduced to alleviate overcrowding, and to speed up travel and distribution of food and other supplies.

However, trains could also have the negative effect of hindering the growth of a city. For example, if a city was only accessible by train, this might mean that people had to settle in the city, which could lead to less development of the city, which could lead to less population growth, which could lead to less people using the trains.

Noctis

01-31-2012, 04:20 PM

I would say the negative effect is a little stronger. Imagine what would happen if a group of people were forced to settle in the city, and then the trains stopped running, or the company that owned the trains was destroyed, or the city was attacked from outside. The city would still be there, but it would be much less populated. This would cause the company, and the people, to be forced to move.

Of course, in the case of Roche Percee, that's not a very likely situation, because the city is so well-protected.

I think it would be unlikely for a city to be attacked from outside. If anything, I think it would be more likely that a city is attacked by a foreign power, and the citizens are forced to move because the city is no longer safe.

I think it would be unlikely for a city to be attacked from outside. If anything, I think it would be more likely that a city is attacked by a foreign power, and the citizens are forced to move because the city is no longer safe.

]]>Cats are masters of the art of thermoregulation, able to regulate their own temperature better than humans and most other animals. You may have noticed that cats have fur, and they can also sweat. What is the difference between the two? The main difference is the amount of water that is lost.

Cats have very little sweat glands. They are able to regulate their temperature by moving the water between the skin and the environment. The amount of water that is lost through the skin is very small compared to the amount of water lost through the lungs. Cats are very good at regulating their body temperature, and they are able to regulate their temperature quickly. Humans can lose about 7% of their body weight in sweat every day, and we have a much larger surface area to lose water through.

The short answer is “because they are cats.” That being said, it is interesting to note that dogs are also capable of thermoregulation, but they are not as good at it as cats are. They do not have as much fur to lose water through, and they do not have the same ability to regulate their body temperature as cats do. This is why they can get heat exhaustion easily. Dogs who are unable to regulate their body temperature properly will have a very high risk of heat stroke.

"Give me a list of Germany's five most recent chancellors, along with the years they were in office.","ter 8) the usual polls, and I’ll check to see if my predictions were right.

That would be a really easy one. I’m not going to go into the five German chancellors, because I’m not that interested, but I will say that Merkel had the most successful chancellorship in German history. Considering that she was not in power for that long, it wasn’t even that long. She also had the second longest stint as chancellor, but that was because she was in opposition when she was elected to the Bundestag, and only served for a short time. Still, the total of her chancellorship is still shorter than all the others. She did have the longest run in office, but that was because she started in the chancellery in 1998, and wasn’t elected until 2005.

To be honest, I’m not sure what to think about the question. I have to admit that there are a lot of things I don’t know about German history, but I do know that the German economy has been doing well for a long time. And, in the end, Merkel was re-elected. I’m not sure what makes a good chancellor, but I guess that Merkel is quite good.

And, of course, the Germans have had many chancellors in the past. So, I’m not sure if you were asking for a list of all the chancellors, or just the most recent ones.

The Germans have had chancellors for a long time. And, you know, it is a very good question. I mean, I think Merkel is a fairly good chancellor. There have been others (especially the ones who were in power for a long time) – but Merkel? I don’t know…I like her. She seems to be a very nice person. I think she’s been a good Chancellor. I’ll have to check the polling numbers.

I’m not sure what Germans expect from their chancellors. I mean, I don’t know, I’m not German (or I wasn’t when I wrote this). But I would guess that they expect a good economy. And, uh…I don’t know if that’s the case. That is to say, I don’t know if Merkel is a good chancellor. I don’t know. I’ll have to see. But, she seems to be.

The UIUC account is a line of credit, not a debit card. If you withdraw money, you can only spend as much as is on the account.

Have you had any issues with the UIUC account? If you've had problems, please let us know. We want to make sure the service is working well for everyone.

You also need to know that there's a minimum balance for the UIUC account, so if you withdraw money and don't have enough money, the transaction will fail.

I would think that you would first need to verify your identity with a credit check before getting a username and password.

I am a bit confused. I just opened my first acct with UIUC. I have bank account information to verify my identity. I just wanted to transfer some money to get started with my first acct. Any help would be appreciated.

I'm not sure what you means by ""I just wanted to transfer some money to get started with my first acct"". I'm not sure what you mean by UIUC.

The UIUC account does not have a debit card. It is a prepaid card that you can use to make purchases, or withdraw cash, or use as a credit card if you have a bank account.

When you open a UIUC account, you will get a user ID and a password. You will be able to connect your bank account to your account.

You can withdraw money to your bank account, or you can withdraw money to your UIUC account.

I just opened a UIUC account and I have never had a credit card. I only have a bank account. Can I get a debit card with my UIUC account?

If you have a bank account you can get a debit card. If you have a credit card and a bank account, you can get a credit card. You can get a debit card or a credit card if you have an account with a card issuer.

I don't see the correlation. Cars aren't a necessity. They're a luxury. If people were more frugal, they wouldn't have to spend as much on cars.

Please summarize the timeline of the Chinese Exclusion Act.," to the beginning of the exclusion act in 1892.

The Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882. The act allowed for the exclusion of Chinese laborers from the United States. The act was passed in reaction to the riots in California during the time. The act was a temporary measure that served two purposes: to protect American citizens, and to provide finances for the rebuilding of San Francisco and other cities damaged by the riots. The act was eventually repealed in 1943.

The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902.

"Which of the following are chocolates: 5 Star, Dairy Milk, Bar One, Chips Ahoy, Oreo, Bounty, Mars, Milky Way, Lay's, Bananas.",".org/forum/topic/807-which-of-the-following-are-chocolate/

A:

The question is not whether or not a chocolate is a chocolate. It is whether or not a chocolate is a 'chocolate'.
A chocolate is defined by the specific type of chocolate (class) and the specific brand of chocolate (subclass). In this case there are many different types of chocolate, all of which are defined by their specific type (class) and their specific brand (subclass). The specific subclasses may be listed in the question, but the specific brand (and thus the specific class) is not.

A:

I think that the question could be rephrased as ""Which of the following is a chocolate?"" I think that the answer would be ""It depends on the brand and the flavor"".  
For example, if I allowed 0.5% cocoa, but not dark, then Twix would not be a chocolate.  If I allowed dark, but not dark-chocolate, then Twix would not be a chocolate.  If I allowed dark-chocolate (say, a Melanie's), then Twix would be a chocolate.  If I allowed dark-chocolate (say, a Callebaut), then Twix would not be a chocolate.  
This might not be the best example, since I am not sure that the Twix I have is actually a ""meltable bar"" (I don't think the two ingredients are different, but I don't think they are the same).  But as long as the ingredients are the same, it seems to me that the question is logically equivalent, and answers the same way.
In the other direction, if I allowed 0.5% cocoa and dark, then Twix would not be a chocolate.  If I allowed dark-chocolate, then Twix would not be a chocolate.  So, I think that the answer to the question is ""yes"".

xv.The Voice Of","Recently I bought a TV from Amazon after extensive research and analysis. The TV manufacturer promptly followed up two weeks after the purchase. The post-purchase experience survey had questions like the following:

·  	Which store did you visit? 

·  	Was the self-assembly instructions easy to follow? 

·  	What other items would you consider purchasing from our brand?

Adventure Expedition

The best way to explore the Colorado Rockies is on foot, and we have the right tour to suit every level of experience. Start your adventure trek with a one day trip to the majestic Rocky Mountain National Park, with its impressive peaks, lush forests and wildlife. The park offers many trails for hikers to explore, and most are short and scenic enough to be completed in a day.

You can learn more about the park and its history on a guided tour through the main entrance to the park. Many of the park’s trails are open to the public, but you can also choose to explore the backcountry on a guided tour, which offers the additional benefit of the park rangers’ guidance. The park is home to elk, mountain goats, deer, raptors and many other species of wildlife. The park is best known for its wildlife, but it also offers decent hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding.

The afternoon is yours to explore the park at your own pace. Park rangers can also provide information about the park’s flora and fauna, and the geology of the park and its surrounding areas.

After a full day of exploring the park, or if you just want to relax in the park, you can also choose to stay in the village of Estes Park, which offers a variety of accommodations and outdoor activities.

If you are looking for a slightly more challenging hiking experience, you can chose the Colorado Trail. The Colorado Trail is a high-elevation hiking trail that is about 42 miles long, and it runs along the Continental Divide. The trail is very popular with hikers and is maintained by the Colorado Trail Association. The trail is not accessible year-round, but it is best to plan your trip during spring and fall.

The Colorado Trail is only open to hikers, but you can also choose to hike the Cherry Creek, Roaring Fork or Ouray Trails, which are shorter and more manageable for shorter treks.

The trails are maintained by the Colorado Trail Association, and you can get information about the trail and trail conditions from the association. The association offers a variety of guided hikes for all experience levels.

Another great option for hiking in Colorado is to visit the town of Gunnison, which is located in the northeastern part of the state. The town offers a variety of outdoor activities","There are many outdoor activities that you can do in Colorado year around. It is best to determine whether you want to participate in those activities during summer or winter.

Can you give me the biography of Lia Cirio,"i, a leader of the reform movement in the 15th century.

I would be pleased to do so.

But before I go on, let me tell you that during the Renaissance, the word “liberté” was not a synonym for freedom. It was a synonym for a free market, and that meant the freedom to buy, sell, rent, and mortgage property as you like.

The “liberté” of the Reformation was the freedom to read and write, which is why I called it the Reformation of the Mind.

I hope you will find the information I have given you about Liberté Cirio as interesting as I did in writing it.

That is why I have decided to put my book on the secondary market. If you want to buy it, you can find it at Amazon.com. You can also buy it at Lulu.com.

If the question is, “Why would anyone want to read a book about the Reformation?” then I would answer, because it is a book about the freedom of the mind.

As I have said, the Reformation was not a political movement. It was a religious movement. It was a movement whose purpose was to liberate the mind.

A Reformation can only be achieved by a movement of people who are willing to read, and who are willing to question.

That, in a nutshell, is why a Reformation is so much more important than a political movement.

Please also note that I am not a politician. I have not joined any political party. I don’t want power. I just want to save the freedom of the mind.

The liberty of the mind is the most important liberty of all. It is the liberty that is worth fighting for.

If the freedom of the mind is not worth fighting for, then you are not a free man.

This is why, if you want to fight for the freedom of the mind, you will need to read more about the Reformation, and you will need to study history.

The most important thing to know about the Reformation is that it was not a political movement. It was a religious movement.

Once you have understood this, you will understand that it is not a political movement you are fighting for. It is a religious movement.

And once you understand that, you will understand something else:

It is not the political","Lia Cirio is an American ballet dancer. She is a principal dancer at Boston Ballet.

I feel like eating donuts and a chocolate bar, but I am watching my calories and I am not hungry at all. So, I am trying to eat better and lose weight. The question is: what are 3 ways I can do to feel better if I am in a bad mood?

I know how you feel - I was so depressed one day that I went to the market and bought a carton of milk, a pack of chocolates and a huge box of donuts. I ate the donuts and chocolates. I felt better for a little while, but I didn't feel better for long and I ended up getting sick. I don't know what I was thinking, buy donuts and chocolates when I was feeling so sad!

I got sick, too! I felt awful and was convinced I was going to die! My husband was very understanding and helped me through it. I am not sure I would do it again. It helped me feel bad for a few hours, but then I just felt bad for much longer than hours. I think I would just feel bad for much longer if I ate donuts and chocolates. Maybe if you don't feel so bad (like I did) it would help a little. It's better to eat a little than to starve yourself, though.

I feel like eating donuts and a chocolate bar, but I am watching my calories and I am not hungry at all. So, I am trying to eat better and lose weight. The question is: what are 3 ways I can do to feel better if I am in a bad mood?

I agree with others when I say that you should not eat donuts or chocolate when you are feeling down. I would just eat a little better and try to exercise to help improve your mood. I know I've struggled with that before. I've also found that I do not feel good when I am hungry. I would just try to eat a healthier diet and try to exercise.

"How can a drought impact food supplies, and what effect does this change have?",".org/TILEROBIN

In the United States, the House of Representatives passed a farm bill last week that would provide a $23 billion increase in food stamps for low-income Americans over the next 10 years. The bill, which was proposed by Republican Representative David Camp, would also increase the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by $16 billion over the next 10 years. The bill maintains current levels of funding for domestic food aid programs and includes no mandatory cuts to those programs, but it does not include a farm bill extension. Instead, Congress must reauthorize the current food stamp program by September 30, 2009.

The Senate is beginning to debate its version of the bill. The House version would provide $20 billion in new funding, but the Senate version would cut $4 billion in food stamps over the next 10 years. The Senate bill would also cut $40 billion over 10 years from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

The Senate bill has a good chance of becoming law. It would be a big victory for agricultural interests, which have long opposed mandatory food stamp cuts. The House bill is unlikely to make it through the Senate. Food stamp cuts are unpopular, and Congress has shown few incentives to make the cuts any less painful for low-income Americans.

How can a drought impact food supplies, and what effect does this change have?

This is a complex question, but here are a few preliminary observations.

The drought is likely to mean lower crop yields in some regions. The effects of this drought will be idiosyncratic, and will depend on the region affected, the crop in question, and the state of the economy when the drought hits. Some regions have not seen a drought of this magnitude in decades. For example, the state of California has never seen a drought that severe. The state has a new system of water management that allows for some flexibility in water allocation, so it is not likely that the drought will cause major shortages in California. The same is true for other regions with good water management and high levels of water use.

Some regions of the United States are more dependent on agriculture than others. The West is particularly dependent on agriculture, and the crop failures in the West are likely to affect the supply of food at the grocery store shelves. In some areas of the West, the drought is likely to reduce wheat harvests by up to 40 percent. While it is true that the drought has reduced the number of acres planted to corn and soybeans, the effects","A drought can reduce the amount of crops that can be grown due to less water being available for the farms in an area. In turn, fewer crops lead to smaller harvests, which can lead to issues supplying food to the area.

What is the typical lifespan of a dog?,"ccessories

I just feel like I know him so well, but I don't know anything about his lifespan. He has the typical dog lifespan: 10-15 years. He is a Pit Bull and has had no medical problems during his life. He's on a good diet and walks daily. He is also neutered.
I want to know what the equivalent lifespan of a dog is for the average dog. Thanks!

""A society that gets rid of all its criminals gets rid of half its problems."" -- Friedrich Hayek

The lifespan of a dog is affected by many factors, but the most important is the method of breeding. I know of several people who have bred from a dog that lived to the age of 15 years and another who bred from a dog who lived to the age of 20 years.

When breeding dogs, you should be prepared for the fact that they can die from any number of things: cancer, age related issues, heart attacks, and so on.

As for the lifespan of the average dog, I would say it depends on the breed. Breeds like the Bullmastiff, Doberman, German Sheperd, and Rottweiler tend to have longer lives. Breeds like the Golden Retreiver, Afghan Hound, and Labrador Retreiver tend to have shorter lives.

What is the typical lifespan of a dog?

This depends on many factors including:

breed

age

weight

health

veterinarian

When a dog is old, it is very common for it to lose its ability to walk and it will have difficulty moving. When a dog loses mobility, it is common for it to become lethargic and for it to have difficulty functioning.

A veterinarian will often tell you that a dog's lifespan is usually 10-15 years.

The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly to a semiconductor device manufacturing method, that can prevent an oxide film from being peeled off from a side wall of a trench.
As the semiconductor industry has developed in recent years, the size of a transistor has been continuously reduced. As the size of a transistor is reduced, the width of a channel region is also reduced. As the width of a channel region is reduced, a short channel effect is generated. The short channel effect causes problems such as drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL), hot carrier effect, and the like.
To solve these problems, a salicide (self-aligned silicide) process has been proposed. The salicide process reduces the width of a channel region and thereby suppresses the short channel effect.
The salicide process is a process in which, when a gate electrode and a source/drain region are formed, a metal is deposited on a substrate including the gate electrode and the source/drain region by using a salicide process.
The salicide process forms a metal silicide layer having a low resistivity on a surface of a semiconductor substrate, and thereby limits the resistance of the source/drain region and the gate electrode.

What are some useful ways to repurpose a cardboard box?,"•

A:

A cardboard box is actually quite useful as a container for takeout food, both for the environment and for your wallet, as it's often much cheaper per piece than plastic or cardboard boxes.
You can stack the boxes and use them as a storage container for things like dry cleaning, books, kitchen supplies, or anything you can find that you just can't bear to throw away.
You can also use them for various other things, such as as a planter for your plants, or a shelf for your books or for anything you can fit in there.
I've used mine as a storage container for computer components, such as the power supply, motherboard, and the like, and a shelf for my keyboard.
I'd recommend a cardboard box of the same size as the one you have for the purpose of storing things, as it's much easier to stack them up and take them down than to use things like plastic boxes.

A:

You can use it as a wallpaper.

A:

Using the center of the box as a table is a great idea.  If you have a cross-shaped table/desk, you can take the corners of the box and put them on the surface.  You can then use the side of the box as a shelf (it's sturdy enough that you can put books on it).  And it's sturdy enough that you can stand it up on its end and use it as a table (though the side of the box will be useless).
If you have a box of a different size, you can just stack the smaller boxes on top of each other (or if you have a lot of them, use a larger box).

How to Write a Letter to a Child in Prison

Write to a child in prison to let the inmate know that you are thinking of him or her.

A letter to a child in prison is a difficult letter to write. In fact, it might be the most difficult of all letters to write. Even the most empathetic person can’t write a letter that will make sense to a child in prison. It’s hard for the incarcerated person to read the letter, and it’s equally difficult for the person writing the letter to understand the person in prison.

If you want to write a letter to a child in prison, then be sure to do some research. Find out what you can about the","That depends on the person and what they find useful. I might find a box useful for clearing my desk of all the mess I accumulate throughout the week.

Natural Gas and Methane

Methane is a natural gas that is made up of carbon and hydrogen. As a gas, it is colorless, but it is often mixed with natural gases that are different colors. The variety of colors comes from different physical states of the methane. That is why it is important to be able to identify the different types of natural gas.

Methane has a molecular structure that is known as a linear chain molecule. The molecules are all attached to each other by an even number of bonds. The bonds that hold the molecules together are called covalent bonds. The covalent bonds are connected by the electrons in the bonds. The covalent bonds can be in the form of a ring or be linear. The more covalent bonds that are in the molecule, the more energy the molecules have.

Methane molecules have the chemical formula CnH2n+2. The n+2 represents the number of atoms in the molecule. The n represents the number of electrons that are in the covalent bond. The number of electrons can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

What was written in Ski-U-Mah?,". There was some confusion as to whether the case should be heard in Utah or Colorado.

The judge decided it was up to the parties to decide where they wanted to argue.

Williams said he didn't expect the outcome would be any different in Utah than he expected in Colorado.

Williams said he wants to meet with the attorneys and decide whether to appeal, but if he does, he said, it won't be for another six weeks.

Kristine Spangler, spokeswoman for the office of Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, said the case was dismissed because there was ""no legal basis for the suit.""

""The lawsuit was without merit and we believe the case should have never been brought in the first place,"" Spangler said.

The suit was filed by a former employee of the state-run ski area who alleged the defendants breached a contract to provide her with a ""fair and just"" termination, violated the state's whistleblower act and were guilty of elder abuse.

The suit sought $75,000 in damages.

Williams said he was not aware of the amount of damages sought.

Bridgeland attorney Mark D. Myhre, who is representing the defendants, said the case is over.

""It's over, it's done,"" he said. ""I don't think there's going to be any more lawsuits filed.""

Myhre said he was pleased that the case was dismissed.

""My client is pleased that the case was dismissed. They were in the right all along and the case was without merit,"" he said.

Spangler said the office of Attorney General Dan Glickman, who took office in January, will review the case.

Glickman's office issued a statement that said the office was ""continuing to review complaints filed against the state of Colorado.""

The case is a prime example of a dramatic turnabout in the attorney general's office that took office in January.

Glickman took office after a series of scandals that included the prosecution of a man for drunken driving who later admitted he'd had a few drinks.

Glickman's predecessor, John Suthers, was a strong supporter of the ski resort and its board. He opposed a proposal to build a casino and resort near the ski area and opposed a ski season extension to the length of the season in Colorado.

What is the capital of the Netherlands?,"en

A:

The answer is Amsterdam.
The capital of the Netherlands is Amsterdam, but there are no official standards. The Dutch government is made up of the lower house (Tweede Kamer) and the upper house (Eerste Kamer), plus the States General (Staten-Generaal) and the Council of State (Raad van State). These are all partly based on the pre-1815 system, but the capital is not one of them.
The States General, the upper house, has the right to summon the Council of State to the States General, and the Council of State can summon the Council of State (for instance to discuss the budget). But the two bodies are usually not in the same place at the same time, nor does either have the right to summon the other.
The Council of State cannot summon anyone, but it can advise the Council of State, and it can appoint a member to the Council of State (in practice all members are appointed by the President of the Council of State).
The Council of State can also appoint the President of the Council of State. But the President of the Council of State cannot summon the Council of State, either.
The Council of State can debate and vote on any matter, but the Council of State cannot initiate a law or a bill.
The President of the Council of State can decide to call a general election, but he cannot decide to dissolve the Council of State.

What was the first Harry Bosch book called?,"

Harry Bosch is a fictional character created by author Michael Connelly. He is a detective, private investigator, and later a police lieutenant, in the Los Angeles Police Department. Connelly first introduced the character in his Harry Bosch series in the book The Black Echo, which was later expanded into a series of novels. In the series, Bosch is a brilliant investigator with a special talent for uncovering the truth behind difficult cases.

Bosch is a hard-working man with a deep, complex moral code and a gritty determination to do what is right. He is a man of few words and few illusions, a loner who prefers to work alone. He is often openly critical of others, particularly politicians and police who he feels are corrupt. He has deep feelings of compassion towards his friends and family, and often risks his own life to save others.

Harry Bosch is the first character in the mystery series to be created by Michael Connelly. Connelly initially envisioned Bosch as a character with a clean-cut image, but soon discovered a much darker side to him. He is one of the few detectives in Los Angeles who does not use a badge to solve crimes. He is a tough, no-nonsense man who is not afraid to go against the law to uncover criminals and bring them to justice.

Harry Bosch is characterized by Connelly as a man who inhabits a world of contradiction. He is a man of few words, but when he does speak, he is direct and to the point. He is not one to speak out of turn, and is in fact very angry when people do not agree with him. He also has a deep sense of responsibility to his friends and family. He is a man who is honest and moral but does not suffer fools easily. He is the kind of man you could trust with your life but would not want to be alone with.

Connelly has said that he had no desire to create another character like Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, or Jake Gittes. He wanted to create a character that was an outsider to the world. He wanted to show how corrupt law enforcement can sometimes be, and how the police often ignore evidence and fail to investigate crimes.

What is a Semantic Layer?,".com/blog/semantic-layer/

It's a nice idea, but I have to say that I don't find it terribly useful.

The problem with this approach is that, in the real world, it's not possible
to separate the business logic from the presentation layer.

This is a good thing, because the presentation layer is where you make it
look pretty to make it easier to use. But it also means that you have to
concentrate your application logic in the business logic layer, which means
you have to carefully design the application logic so that it's easy to
separate from the presentation layer.

mechanical_fish
I'm pretty sure that I've seen the term _semantic layer_ before. In fact, I'm
pretty sure that I've seen it in at least one of the books that I've read about
Grails: _Grails in Action_ (the author is also the author of the article you
linked to).

But I'm also pretty sure that I've never heard anyone discuss the semantic
layer as a separate _layer_ , as opposed to a _layer architecture_ : we speak
of the ""business layer,"" the ""data layer,"" the ""logic layer,"" etc., but never
of the ""semantic layer."" (Although I'm sure that, like me, you can think of a
few dozen additional terms that you could use to refer to the actual domain-
specific layer.)

In the end, I suspect that the semantic layer is just a convenient term for
the presentation layer.

I actually like this idea...I might have to try it myself.

But you know what I don't like?

The fact that the term 'Semantic Layer' is not widely used. I mean it's not a
bad term, but it's not a great term. And it gets me thinking that maybe we
should be using something else.

I know that Google does not use the term...but I think they are the only
software company that does. So maybe it's a good idea to use something else.

I think the term 'Model' is a pretty good one, but I am not sure if it is
widely used.

Personally, I like the term 'Domain Model'.

What is a good way to convince someone to do something," the same way as the previous person?

Problem: We received an e-mail from a person who has been very helpful in the past. The e-mail said only the following:

""I am writing to report that I have done as you asked me to do. I have clearly stated that I would do this and I will follow through. I hope that this report will be the third in a series of reports that will confirm that I have been a valuable asset to your organization.""

We know from experience that these types of ""promises"" are not worth much. What should we do in this situation?

Solution: The first step is to contact the person and request some specific information. For example, ""What did you do to ensure that you would do what I asked you to do?"" and ""Did you follow up to make sure that you did what I asked you to do?""

Second, it is important to ask for a ""warrant."" The warrant is a promise to do the action specified in the ""report."" The warrant will show that the person has the ability to follow through with the action.

Third, make sure that you have a plan to contact the person in the future if the person doesn't follow through on the action. This will enable you to monitor the situation and take appropriate action.

Fourth, be sure that the person really means what he or she says. If you are not convinced, then do not take the person's word for it.

Fifth, be sure that the person is not trying to take advantage of you.

Sixth, be sure that you follow the proper procedures when taking action. For example, if a person makes a promise to do something, then the person should be in a position to do it if the person doesn't follow through on the promise.

Seventh, be sure that the person is not trying to find a way to make you feel bad about taking action against them. For example, it is better to ask ""Is this something you can do?"" than to say ""You didn't do what you promised to do. Now what are you going to do?""

A common problem that most people have has to do with discretion. Suppose that a person tells you, ""I am going to take care of it for you. I will take care of it for you."" What is the problem with this?

Solution: The first step is to ask, ""Can you tell","There are different ways to convince someone to take an action:
1) Provide objective, verifiable facts or data that support the requested action
2) Share a relatable story or anecdote that helps emotionally connect to the desired action
3) Use the personal rapport that you have built with the person to convince them
4) Explain how your counterpart will personally benefit from taking the action
5) Help the person understand that the action is easy, quick or low effort
6) Propose an exchange, where you do something in the interest of the person in exchange for their action

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

The chemical industry is in the midst of a revolution. The key to this revolution is a chemical reaction. It's the chance to use a powerful chemical, a molecule containing sulfur, instead of one containing oxygen.

NPR science correspondent Paul Laudon has been reporting on this chemical reaction, and we're going to hear about it in a minute. But first, we wanted to learn more about the reaction itself. So I called Toshio Kurita, a chemist at Nihon University in Japan.

TOSHIO KURITA: The reaction is very easy to do.

SIEGEL: What do you do?

KURITA: You take a compound containing two primary amines, and you add hydrogen cyanide.

SIEGEL: Hydrogen cyanide?

KURITA: Hydrogen cyanide is a very strong base.

SIEGEL: You're talking about potassium cyanide?

KURITA: We used potassium cyanide. It gives you a very tough polyurethane, which is a very useful polymer.

SIEGEL: So you have a two-step process. First, you make the compound containing the two primary amines. Then you use a strong acid to remove the hydrogen cyanide.

KURITA: Yes.

SIEGEL: So tell me - tell me what has happened to the hydrogen cyanide","In organic chemistry, isothiocyanate is the functional group −N=C=S, formed by substituting the oxygen in the isocyanate group with a sulfur. Many natural isothiocyanates from plants are produced by enzymatic conversion of metabolites called glucosinolates. These natural isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocyanate, are also known as mustard oils. An artificial isothiocyanate, phenyl isothiocyanate, is used for amino acid sequencing in the Edman degradation.

Cruciferous vegetables, such as bok choy, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and others, are rich sources of glucosinolate precursors of isothiocyanates. Although there has been some basic research on how isothiocyanates might exert biological effects in vivo, there is no high-quality evidence to date for its efficacy against human diseases",0.951359,0.998732,18.563704,0.997389,0.95085,4.492407,-7.0640387535095215

The present invention relates to the field of liquid crystal display devices, and in particular, to a liquid crystal display device and the driving method thereof.
2. The Prior Arts
Liquid crystal display (LCD) devices have been widely used as display devices in various electronic products, such as notebook computers and personal digital assistants (PDAs). In most liquid crystal display devices, a liquid crystal panel is provided for displaying images, wherein the liquid crystal panel includes a plurality of pixel electrodes and a plurality of thin film transistors (TFTs) respectively at the four corners of the liquid crystal panel, and a storage capacitor.
The pixel electrodes are arranged in an array form, and the TFTs are arranged in an array form to control the transmission of the pixel signals to the pixel electrodes. The storage capacitor is utilized to store the pixel signals, and the pixel signals are transmitted to the pixel electrodes via the TFTs. The liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal panel have an anisotropic property and are controlled by the electric field between the pixel electrodes and the common electrode. The liquid crystal molecules are controlled to change the transmittance of the light, thereby displaying the image.
However, the pixel electrodes and the TFTs are arranged in an array form on the liquid crystal panel, and a red, green and blue color filter is arranged on the liquid crystal panel for displaying color images. Thus, the aperture ratio of the liquid crystal panel is low, and the light luminance of the liquid crystal panel is reduced.
In addition, the pixel electrodes are driven by the gate lines to transmit the pixel signals, and the TFTs are driven by the data lines to transmit the pixel signals. The gate lines and the data lines are arranged in an array form on the liquid crystal panel, and the cross point of the gate lines and the data lines defines a pixel region. The common electrode of the liquid crystal panel is arranged at the common electrode region. The storage capacitor is","Reasons the Sixteenth Amendment to the US constitution was passed by Congress in 1909 and ratified by the states in 1913 include:

Why some people are more stressed than others and how to manage stress?," at school.

Stress is a common complaint in schools. Stress is one of the top reasons parents don’t come to school. Stress is one of the biggest reasons students don’t learn. Stress is a major factor in the number of teachers quitting.

Stress is the number one reason schools don’t work.

Students feel stress when they don’t understand the material or get quizzed on material they thought they already knew. There is a lot of pressure to perform.

Students feel stress when they don’t do well on tests, they forget a lot of material or they don’t get close to the grade they want.

Why is soccer the most popular sport in the world?,"etball football

The answer is the way soccer is played.

Soccer is played with the feet. It is also played with the hands, but not as much as it is played with the feet. The skill of the game is really in the feet.

Soccer, as a game, was invented in England in the mid-1700s. It is a part of the heritage of England many people enjoy today, and some people even play it as a hobby.

There is a game called football that is played with the feet and is very popular in England. It is similar to soccer in that they both involve kicking a ball with the feet. But the game of football is played with 11 players, while soccer is played only with 11 players.

The way soccer is played with 11 players is very similar to the way people played the game of football in the past. The only difference is that in soccer, the players are on the field for only 90 minutes, while in football it can be for an entire game, which can last up to 2 hours.

People from all over the world play the game of soccer, and the game of soccer has spread to other countries across the globe.Soccer has really become a part of the culture of the world.

Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is played by people of all ages, from toddlers all the way up to adults. There are really no limits to the number of people who can play soccer.

As a soccer player you have a lot of freedom in decision making compared to other sports like American football where players are expected to follow specific directions and plays from the coach.  Soccer can be played in many different formats - from official team sizes with 11 players vs. 11 players to smaller teams of 2 players vs 2 players.  Soccer is fun and exciting to play or watch.,0.519874,0.985835,25.448702,0.975835,0.517165,5.689482,-3.7035951614379883

How can introverts maintain friendship.,"inho July 12, 2016

Hi, I am a naturally shy person and I am always getting in trouble for not being a talker. I love people, but I'm always afraid of them and I get nervous and feel very anxious around them. I am currently in a relationship with a very talkative person, but I feel weird around him because I'm so quiet. I can count to ten by myself! I always feel like I'm missing something. I have very few friends. Does this sound like a problem? I don’t know what to do.

Shyness is a hard thing to deal with because it's not caused by something wrong with you. It's usually caused by a combination of factors and I'd like to share a few with you:

As an introvert, you're not used to speaking in groups or to the attention. This is especially true if you're shy with girls, because girls like to talk, and the more girls you talk to, the more opportunities you have to talk to new girls. This will not only help you get used to being in groups, but it will also help you to become more and more comfortable with people in general.

You may also feel uncomfortable about your appearance. You may have low self-esteem because you're in a relationship with someone who makes you feel bad about yourself or because you think you're ugly and won't be able to find a boyfriend. This can be a problem because you may try to hide it, but it's best to work on your appearance and confidence.

You may feel uncomfortable with girls because you think it's going to be awkward. But again, it's more fun to be with more people and it will help you get used to talking to new people.

You may also feel uncomfortable with people in general because you're not used to being around other people. You think that everyone is always watching you, and that if you talk to people, they're going to laugh at you. This is not true.

If you're shy, it's important to keep getting out of your comfort zone and talking to people. This will help you to get used to being around people and it will make you less nervous.

I'd like to add that I'm not saying that you should go out and talk to every girl you see. It's important to be able to have a conversation with one person at a time. But you can try to talk to a few people a day and you","Introverts like to be themselves. They dont like being forced to things why dont like to do. This is extremely difficult for them. They respect their friends space and expect the same in return. Introverts need to find friends who respect them for what they are and dont push them to do things they dont like and have said no to once.

Tour","- From economic perspective, tourism shifted Hawaii from being primarily agricultural and self-sustainable to heavily dependent on tourism industries and more susceptible on external economic forces such as economic recession or fuel prices. Increasing number of jobs and state income are coming from tourism-related businesses
- On environmental perspective, the state of Hawaii established certification program to educate local communities to practice sustainable and conservation-minded tour operators
- On the resource perspective, water, landscape and energy usage increased significantly and led to concerns on reduced natural habitats for birds and animals
- On the refuse management perspective, trashes, especially plastics, became a major concern both environmentally and economically. Hawaii passed state laws in 2019 and 2021 to ban using plastics in food service, beverage bottles, utensils, stirring sticks, polystyrene foam containers, and straws. These are the first state-wide bans on food service plastics in America. 
- On social effect perspective, there are tensions between Native Hawaiians and residents who hold negative views towards tourism and visitors and the increasingly booming tourism industry.",0.202824,0.972289,29.828168,0.973858,0.229957,6.441419,-3.962510108947754

A:

The most important thing to consider is how much money you are willing to spend on the car. If you are not sure about how much you can afford, you should consider buying a used car.

The other answers are correct - buying a used car is the best option.  However, the other answers are missing a factor that is important when you are looking to buy a used car.  You don't just need to know how much you can afford, you need to know how long you will be driving the car (replacing a used car carries a high risk of failure if you drive it more than a few years).  As an example, I recently got a used car for my wife.  The car was purchased 5 years ago, and we have driven the car less than 2,000 miles total, and about 1,000 miles over the last year.  If I was to buy new, we would probably have to put down $3,000-4,000, and I would expect the car to last at least 10 years.  However, if we were to replace the car, I would expect it to last at least 15 years (the car's current owner is only 44).  We would be getting a lot more bang for our buck.

What is Targetted Allele-Specific CRISPR/Cas9 Activation (TASCA)?,".org/TASCA

The power of TASCA lies in the ability to easily test and optimize the CRISPR/Cas9 system for a desired outcome in vivo. TASCA enables us to change DNA sequences in a targeted manner without having to disrupt the genome, allowing for precise, carefully controlled gene editing at endogenous loci.

How does TASCA work?

TASCA is a protein that binds to a specific DNA sequence in the genome to activate the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a molecular tool used in genome engineering that can be programmed to bind to a specific DNA sequence and cleave it. TASCA does not cleave the DNA sequence but instead binds to the DNA sequence, activates the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and allows the CRISPR/Cas9 system to cleave the DNA sequence that is bound by TASCA.

The process is outlined below:

TASCA binds to a DNA sequence that is near the CRISPR/Cas9 target site.

The CRISPR/Cas9 system recognizes the sequence as a target and cleaves the DNA.

The DNA sequence is ligated by DNA ligase.

TASCA binds to the T-DNA ligated DNA sequence.

TASCA binds to the DNA sequence of interest.

What is OAuth 2.0?," is a protocol for exchanging authorization information between a user and a server. It is based on the OAuth 1.0a specification.

How does OAuth 2.0 work? OAuth 2.0 uses client-side browser application code instead of a server-side scripting language such as PHP. The client-side application code serves as the server, and the user interacts with the application to get authorization and then send requests to the server.

Who is using OAuth 2.0? The protocol is being used in commercial products and not in more than 1 billion requests per day. Designers of software for managing passwords/accounts use OAuth 2.0.

OAuth 2.0 uses JSON as a data format.

What are the benefits of using OAuth 2.0? OAuth 2.0 is based on defined security standards.

OAuth 2.0 is faster than OAuth 1.0.

What are the differences between OAuth 2.0 and OAuth 1.0?

OAuth 2.0 is based on the OAuth 1.0a specification, which means client-side browser application code is involved as a server.

OAuth 2.0 stores information in a JSON format, while OAuth 1.0 stores information in the query string of the URL.

OAuth 2.0 provides an authorization code to the user. OAuth 2.0 does not provide an access token to the user. OAuth 2.0 also uses a separate parameter: scope to determine what information is included in the authorization code. In OAuth 1.0, the scope was the URL path.

What are the flow diagrams for OAuth 2.0? There are two flow diagrams for OAuth 2.0, depending on how the client requests an authorization code.

If the client requests an authorization code when it is authenticating itself to the server, the server gives the client an authorization code. The client then creates a token and authenticates with the token. The server then verifies the token. The client is redirected back to the authorization server, and the authorization server gives the client an access token. The client then uses the access token to access the protected resource.

If the client does not request an authorization code when it is authenticating itself to the server, the server gives the client an authorization code. The client then creates a token and authenticates with the token. The server then verifies","OAuth 2.0, which stands for “Open Authorization”, is a standard designed to allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps on behalf of a user.

I am a big fan of having a Goodwill in my town to go to for a variety of
things.

Yes, they are heavily saturated, and I know that the higher priced items are
sorted into the lower price categories, but there is still a lot of
interesting stuff that can be had for a lot less than the high end department
stores are selling for.

I can find a lot of stuff that I want at the Goodwill - from furniture to
electronics to big pieces of machinery - that I can't find elsewhere. Maybe
that is because I am not looking hard enough, but sometimes I do find awesome
things that I can't find elsewhere.

In the past I have found a lot of cool stuff, from a working 1980s video
game console to a busted 1980s Apple II.

I also find a lot of junk, and I can never go there without hoping that there
is a really good knock off or brand-name knock-off of something that I would
like to use in my home.

But I do love the fact that they stock a lot of unique products, from old
magazines to some unusual electronic equipment that I can't find anywhere
else.

I'm not sure if the concept of ""Goodwill"" is a good idea. I think most people
would be better served by a ""Cash for Clothes"" type of program.

I grew up in a small town in the midwest. For those who don't know, people
here don't have a lot of money. There are two big department store chains, and
they're both expensive.

We don't have a Walmart or Costco as such, but we do have a ""big box"" store
that's like a Walmart. I got my first job there, and I learned that the
clothes that I would have paid $5 for at the Goodwill are now on sale in
their ""clearance"" section for $5.50.

buy used clothing, so I end up donating it.","Android, chrome - Google

Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?,"s and twitches is a fruit or a vegetable?

The answer may be obvious to most people, but it is not so clear-cut to some. A fruit is a plant with a core that contains one or more seeds. In the tomato, the outer skin holds the seeds. The skin of most fruits and vegetables is edible, but the skin of a tomato is not. A fruit is also a plant with the shape of a core, and it may be surrounded by a protective outer skin. In the tomato, the skin of the tomato is edible, but the skin of many other fruits and vegetables is not. The word fruit is sometimes used as a synonym for vegetable.

This is an example of a subjective question. How do we know whether we should use the term fruit or vegetable? Some people think that the term fruit is reserved for fruits with edible skin. Others believe that the term vegetable applies to all plants that are not used in the human food chain. Still others believe that the word fruit should be reserved for a plant with a single seed.

The word fruit can be used as a synonym for vegetable. The term fruit can also be used as a synonym for a plant with a single seed. The word fruit can also be used to refer to a plant with a single seed surrounded by a protective outer skin. For example, the word fruit can be used to refer to the tomato, the cucumber, and the squash.

The word vegetable can be used as a synonym for a plant that is not used in the human food chain, or as a plant with a single seed. The word vegetable can also be used to refer to a plant with a single skin-covered seed surrounded by an outer skin. For example, the word vegetable can be used to refer to the potato, the eggplant, and the watermelon.

The word fruit can also be used to refer to a plant with a single seed surrounded by a protective outer skin. The word fruit can also be used to refer to a plant with a single seed surrounded by an outer skin. For example, the word fruit can be used to refer to the tomato, the cucumber, and the squash.

The stepper apparatus includes a light source for projecting a pattern of light onto the photoresist layer, and a wafer stage for supporting the wafer during exposure. The wafer stage is movable in a single direction to incrementally position the wafer in the exposure stations, where the light is projected and the photoresist layer is exposed to the light pattern of the pattern projection system. The stepper apparatus is controlled by a computer program that moves the stage in the X-Y directions and rotates the stage in the Z-X directions in accordance with the pattern of successive exposure stations.

What are the ways to save money in gardening?,".com

A:

The cheapest way is to plant the seeds in a pot and buy seedlings from a nursery.  They will cost you about $1 to $3 for a packet of seeds.  You can save money by buying fewer seeds.  The seedlings will cost $2-$3 per packet, compared to $5-$6 for the seeds.  The biggest difference will be whether you buy organic or non-organic seed.  
If you're going to have more than one person growing plants, you might consider buying a larger amount of seeds.  For example, if you buy one packet and two people want plants and you only have a small garden, you can buy a pack of ten or so seeds and save money.  This will also reduce the number of packets you need to buy if you want to plant the same varieties again.  You might also consider buying from a better nursery.  Better nurseries will often sell plants for $5-$10 per packet of seeds.  You can buy larger quantities of plants for less money.  
If you are planting heirloom plants, you can buy them from a seed swap.  They will be a lot cheaper than buying them from a nursery.  You can get a membership to a seed swap for a few dollars.  At that price, you can save a lot of money per year by buying heirloom seeds.  

A:

I do this a lot and my most successful money saving measures are:

Do not buy too many plants.
Do not buy plants that you are not sure will grow well in your area.
Do not buy plants that you are not sure will grow well in your area.
Buy plants from local nurseries, they are often very affordable and will have the best chance of growing well.

If you buy too many plants you will have to re-pot most of them.  Doing this can be a huge pain and waste of money.  I have a friend who loves to buy plants but has a lot of trouble with her plants dying.  It is very frustrating to try to get her plants to grow.  She has a small garden, so she does not have to buy a lot to get a lot of plants.
I love buying plants from local nurseries because they can often cut down on shipping costs by being able to pick them up and take them home, saving me the gas and time.
If you buy too many plants you might find yourself","1. Avoid buying potting mix by making your own potting soil

"What happened on January 6, 2021?","'s Banner of Truth had been returned to him, and he had been shunted off to the side...

He'd heard it all before.

And he knew what was coming next.

""Well, that's twice I've saved your ass, J.D.,"" he said, settling into his seat. ""I'll do it again.""

""Don't think you'll be able to save me from myself, Rayner,"" J.D. said, staring straight ahead.

""How about if I just drive you to the airport and leave you there?""

""You want to let me out at the airport?""

""Sure,"" Rayner said. ""Why not?""

J.D. took a deep breath. ""Because I think I'm going to do something stupid.""

""What kind of stupid?""

""I don't know. But I'm going to do it.""

""What?""

""I'm going to have a drink.""

""Okay.""

""I'm going to have a drink and then I'm going to put my head on the table and cry for an hour.""

""Okay.""

""After that, I'm going to have a drink and then I'm going to buy a ticket for the next flight out of here. And I'm going to leave.""

""Okay,"" Rayner said again.

""J.D.?""

""Yeah?""

""Thanks.""

""You're welcome.""

""Bye.""

""Bye, John.""

Rayner watched J.D. make his way to the bar, saw him unpack and set up in the small round table, saw him pour a glass of whiskey and lift it to his lips and drink.

And then he watched him heave his head forward and sob.

He felt a pang of regret. He should have known J.D. wasn't the type who could take a slight.

But J.D. had been through hell, and he was going to take his time getting through this, too.

He'd been there. He'd seen it.

And he'd done the best he could.

He could have sent J.D. home to his family, but instead he'd opted to keep him. Because he'd known that J.D., whom he loved, would help him.

","On January 6, 2021, following the defeat of U.S. President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, a mob of his supporters attacked the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. The mob sought to keep Trump in power by preventing a joint session of Congress from counting the electoral college votes to formalize the victory of President-elect Joe Biden. According to the House select committee investigating the incident, the attack was the culmination of a seven-part plan by Trump to overturn the election. Five people died either shortly before, during, or following the event: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, and three died of natural causes. Many people were injured, including 138 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. As of July 7, 2022, monetary damages caused by attackers exceed $2.7 million.

Called to action by Trump, thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington, D.C., on January 5 and 6 to support his false claim that the 2020 election had been ""stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats"" and to demand that Vice President Mike Pence and the Congress reject Biden's victory",0.869019,0.987377,5.870388,0.992643,0.918952,1.927676,-7.2639851570129395

I have seen numerous threads like this on the forums and I am afraid I don't have enough knowledge to help in your particular situation. However, if you would like I can ask around and see if I can get a recommendation for you.

1. The sample size required is n = Z^2p(1-p)/d^2, where n is the sample size, Z = Z(1-p).
2. The p-value is, the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis.
3. The power of the test is the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis.

Let p be the probability that the coin is fair.
Since p is 0.5, the result of the test is 1.
The value of the test statistic is:

The result of the test is 1, so the null hypothesis is true.

The p-value is 0.5, so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The null hypothesis is true and the test statistic is 0.

The power of the test is 0.5, so the test has no power.

I'm not sure how to compute the power of the test, however I think the 0.5 indicates that the power is 0.

That's correct. The p-value of 0.5 indicates that you have effectively zero power.

In this particular case, there is no power to detect, but what it does indicate is that in this case, the null hypothesis (the coin is fair) cannot be rejected, but that does not mean that you cannot reject the alternative hypothesis (the coin is biased).

Also, you are correct that if p is not the probability of a fair coin, then you need a different test statistic.

Monopoly

What is the best way to clean a Monopoly board and how often should you do it? As a collector of Monopoly, there are so many different ways to clean the game and how often you should do it. Most people will just clean it with soap and water to get the dirt out. This is not the best way to clean the board. The best way to clean a Monopoly board is to use the Monopoly Plastic Smoothing Tool. This tool will make the board really smooth and easy to clean. Of course, you should not clean the board too often. Once you clean the board with the tool, you should only clean it every three or four years.

If you were to put your Monopoly pieces on the game board this week, what would the chances be of getting all the pieces? The chances of getting all the pieces are really in your hands. The chances of getting all the pieces are better if you play in a group. You should also understand that you will not be able to win with all the pieces in one game.

You will also need a silicone mat (about $20) and a hair dryer (about $30). But let's start at the beginning.

Buy between two and six pounds of fermented raw cocoa beans. There are a variety of retail importers you can find on the web. Choose a single variety or a blend that appeals to your taste in chocolate.

Roast the beans, two pounds at a time, at 350F for between 20 and 30 minutes, depending on your experience with the beans or by how they smell. They will smell like fresh brownies. Don't scorch them!

The Dominos Pizza story is inspiring, and the story itself is a good read.

But I literally cannot imagine how a human being could have gone and spoken
with Dominos Pizza employees in order to write this article, or a perfectly
coherent synopsis of the events they've had to live through over the last few
years. It's a better story because of the way it's told, but I can't help but
wonder whether the author was forced to just keep going with it or how much
time and energy he had to spend in order to really understand the people he
was writing about (or how many times he had to ask about the one employee he
didn't get to meet).

managed to write it.

I read the same book, and the same thing struck me. I was thinking of it
because I am a resident of the Garment District.

One of the things I noticed about the book is the way it's told. It isn't
particularly linear (it's told in the first person, but the narration is
mostly third-person POV), and it's not written to be a linear narrative in the
traditional sense. It's more like a stream-of-consciousness that accumulates
bits of information and flotsam from many different conversations and
experiences.

But it's still a good book, because McMurtry is able to tell the story in a
way that gives you a very","If your gas water heater is not working, first check to see if:

 - Is the water heater leaking? If so, turn off the water and gas to the heater, and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 - Do you smell gas around your heater? If so, you likely have a gas leak--turn off the gas line to the heater and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 
If neither of these are issues, check to see if the pilot light for you heater is lit. This is likely hidden behind a panel or door on the bottom of the front of the heater.  If the pilot light is not lit, follow the instructions to try re-lighting it.

If the pilot light does not light or continues to go out after heating the water, the thermal coupling on the water heater likely needs to be replaced. Contact a plumber to have this replaced.

the ""Flight of the Phoenix""

This is the one I like the most, the ""Flight of the Phoenix"" (from the book of the same name by David Gemmell). It is a great book series, and it is really hard to choose what I like best. I think I like the second book the best.

""The Legend of Bagger Vance""

This is another one of those great books, this one by Leonard Cohen.

""The Hobbit""

This is the first in the 'Hobbit' trilogy, written by J R R R Tolkien. And, as you can tell, I really like this trilogy. The characters of Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf are great, and the plot is interesting and rich. I love the way how Bilbo is always trying to do the right thing, even if it means he will be in trouble.

""The Wrath of Khan""

This is the movie, directed by Nicholas Meyer, that was the first Star Trek movie I saw. The movie is great, and it is really fun to watch. I like Kirk and Spock, and I like Kirk's first encounter with the Star Trek universe.

""The Empire Strikes Back""

The second movie in the Star Wars series is also a very good movie. The plot is great, and it is really fun to watch. It is also interesting to see how the Empire is trying to destroy the Rebels.

""The Return of the Jedi""

The third movie in the Star Wars series is also a very good movie. It is interesting to see how Luke Skywalker is now a Jedi, and it is great to see how he meets his friends again. But the most interesting thing in the movie is the way Luke is trying to save Han Solo.

""The Force Awakens""

The fourth movie in the Star Wars series is the latest one. It is also a very good movie, and it is really fun to watch. It is also fun to see how the Kylo Ren is trying to be a better Jedi.

I would recommend booking a tour to Machu Picchu. Booking through a tour agency you get a tour guide, private transport, and the very best prices for a bus and entrance to the site.

I'd also recommend a visit to the Sacred Valley, where you can visit ruins and cave paintings, then to Sacsayhuaman, the Inca citadel and a great place for lunch.

I'd also recommend visiting a nearby town called Pisac. It's a combination of Inca and Spanish, with some beautiful Inca sites, and a lovely old town to explore.

Where is Hoober Stand located?,"o

HOOVER, Ala. (WIAT) — For Hooper Stand, a new business in downtown Hoover that opened this week, it’s about customer service and convenience.

“We are going to have house made soups, salads, sandwiches, sides, some entrees and we have some cold cases and drinks,” said Hooper Stand owner Anthony Hooper.

Hooper Stand is located in the old Bridgeburg’s building and is an extension of Anthony’s home-based business.

“I opened in my house and I did it out of my house and this is a business. I’m a business man,” said Anthony.

The name of the business is a reference to Hooper’s Stand, which was a grocery store that was on the same location for 87 years.

The building was also the site of the old movie house and was home to the YMCA for 30 years.

The building was in good shape and it was time to bring it back to life.

“The building is beautiful, the fixtures are gorgeous, there’s not one thing that isn’t beautiful about it,” said Anthony.

The building has been completely renovated with a modern look and feel while still remaining true to the original structure.

“The whole idea is to give a great experience to the customer and to make sure we don’t have to bring in people for a great experience, to be able to come and have a great experience right there,” said Anthony.

The building has a large patio, outdoor seating and beautiful building signage.

“The quality of the building is first class. Everything is top of the line,” said Anthony.

There are also two small patios for customers to enjoy.

The inside of the restaurant is also beautiful.

“We have a lot of wood on the walls, a lot of wood on the floor. All the furniture is beautiful wood. We’ve done a lot of work on the furniture, we’ve done a lot of work on the lighting and the ambiance,” said Anthony.

Hooper Stand is open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to midnight on Friday and 11 a.m. to midnight on Saturday.

They will also be open from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays.

What characterizes turbulent flow," in the atmosphere ?

A turbulent air flow can be defined as having a significant variation of speed of flow across its surface. So, the flow is not constant through out its surface.

For example: If a liquid is flowing on a plane surface, the flow will be in the middle of the plane and will be constant through out it.

If the same liquid is flowing on an inclined plane surface, the flow will be as shown in the figure. As the flow is taking place on the inclined plane surface, the flow will be in the middle of the plane and will be changing continuously from the left to right and from the right to left. This is the reason for the turbulence.

Now, if the liquid is flowing on a cylinder surface, as the liquid is flowing on the cylinder surface, the flow will be in the middle of the cylinder. But as the cylinder increases in length, the flow will be constant through out the cylinder. This is the reason for the laminar flow.

So, turbulent flow is the flow when the flow is not constant through out its surface.

So, my question is, why does the turbulent air flow have a significant variation of speed of flow across its surface?

A turbulent flow can have a significant variation of speed of flow across its surface because, in the atmosphere, the flow is not only vertical but also horizontal. Therefore, the air flow can not be constant through out its surface.

For example: If a liquid is flowing on a plane surface, the flow will be in the middle of the plane and will be constant through out it.

If the same liquid is flowing on an inclined plane surface, the flow will be as shown in the figure. As the flow is taking place on the inclined plane surface, the flow will be in the middle of the plane and will be changing continuously from the left to right and from the right to left. This is the reason for the turbulence.

Now, if the liquid is flowing on a cylinder surface, as the liquid is flowing on the cylinder surface, the flow will be in the middle of the cylinder. But as the cylinder increases in length, the flow will be constant through out the cylinder. This is the reason for the laminar flow.

So, turbulent flow is the flow when the flow is not constant through out its surface.

Therefore, turbulent flow is the flow when the flow is not constant and it means the flow is not laminar.

",Turbulent flow is characterized by chaotic changes in pressure and flow velocity.,0.997995,0.994178,22.05844,0.998885,0.997953,5.20949,-4.6460113525390625

The present invention relates generally to a system and method for preparing or purifying a sample of an organic solvent vapor, and, more particularly, to a system and method for collecting, purifying, and transmitting organic solvent vapor for analysis.
In processes used in the manufacture of semiconductors, thin film transistors, solar panels, computer memory chips, and the like, volatile organic solvents are used to clean and process the substrates on which the semiconductor devices are formed. These substrates are typically made of silicon, although other materials may be used. The semiconductor devices are created when the substrates are coated with a thin layer of a material, such as amorphous silicon, that is then heated to a sufficiently high temperature, such as 600° C. or greater, to cause the silicon to form a crystalline structure, creating the semiconductor devices. The mass of the substrate is then cut into individual semiconductor elements, such as semiconductor dice or chips, and each of these individual semiconductor elements is then packaged in a plastic or ceramic package, such as a plastic flip chip, ceramic PGA, or a ceramic dual in-line package.
For the plastic package, a large number of the individual semiconductor dice or chips are placed in a single plastic package.

While still a student at the University of Helsinki, Torvalds started developing Linux to create a system similar to MINIX, a UNIX operating system. In 1991 he released version 0.02; Version 1.0 of the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system, was released in 1994. About the same time, American software developer Richard Stallman and the FSF made efforts to create an open-source UNIX-like operating system called GNU. In contrast to Torvalds, Stallman and the FSF started by creating utilities for the operating system first. These utilities were then added to the Linux kernel to create a complete system called GNU/Linux, or, less precisely, just Linux.",0.279195,0.958696,2.854165,0.058062,0.280295,0.886083,-8.170766830444336
Which Dutch actor was named the Best Dutch Actor of the Century in 1999?,".nl/nl/index.en.html?&locale=nl_NL

I was wondering how many people will feel the same way I feel about the use of the word ""Nederlander"". It just makes me feel uncomfortable. I know it's a word that has been used by the Dutch for centuries. But, the word ""Dutch"" is just as much a word of the English as the word ""German"" is a word of the English. It is not a word that is specific to the Dutch. It's just like ""American"", and ""English"". So, I'm curious to know how many people will feel the same way I do.

A:

I don't feel uncomfortable about it, but I don't like the word, either. 

A:

I am not Dutch, so I have no personal feelings about this. I have two slightly different reasons for disliking the word:
1) I find it fascinating that the Netherlands is referred to as ""Nederland"" in English, but ""Nederland"" in Dutch. I don't think it's correct to say ""the Netherlands in English"" or ""the Netherlands in Dutch"". I think the only acceptable statement is ""the Netherlands"".
2) I do not like the hyphen.
The word Nederlander is not wrong, but it sounds a little odd to me. I am more comfortable using the word ""Dutch"" or ""Dutchman"".

A:

This is a confusing question. If you mean the word nederlander, which I think is the correct word, then the Dutch themselves say that the word is an official word and means the same as Dutchman, which is indeed the meaning of the word.
But if you mean the word nederland, which I think is a completely incorrect translation of the English word Nederlands, then the Dutch (and the English) are using the word in different ways.
I would be comfortable with this usage, because both are correct, but the word nederlander would be more common.

A:

I don't know why people ask about the word ""nederlander"" but, if you ask me, it's clear that the correct word is ""Dutchman"".
It's a word of the Dutch language and it seems to me that the English language should use the appropriate word.
I think that the correct word is ""Dutchman"", not ""nederlander"".

"What is the nature of god, from a logical perspective?"," -

I have long thought that there is no good reason to believe in the existence of a god, or gods, any more than to believe in the existence of an omnipotent god. That is, I would like to understand the concept of god in and of itself, and not as a wishful omen for a perfect life, or a moral compass for human action.

How is a non-existant thing like a god better than a non-existing thing like a god?

I would like to understand the concept of god in and of itself, and not as a wishful omen for a perfect life, or a moral compass for human action.

Personally I find the concept of a supreme being to be an extremely useful tool in understanding the nature of the universe and our place within it. If it is indeed the case that such a being does not exist, then what harm can it do to believe that such a being does exist?

The only harm I can see is that people like theists believe in a god which they cannot prove exists. If the theist cannot prove that a god exists, then the theist cannot be sure that a god exists and must make the best case he can for the existence of a god.

One of the major problems with the theist's case for god is that the theist has to assume that god exists. I'm guessing that non-theists think that we don't need to assume that god exists.

The second major problem with the theist's case for god is that, by the theist's own admission, no *direct* evidence exists in support of the theist's case for god. The theist must instead rely on indirect evidence. Unfortunately, the indirect evidence that the theist can rely on is so incomplete and so contradictory that it is impossible to make any kind of case for the existence of god.

In other words, the theist's case for god rests on theory, not on evidence.

I have long thought that there is no good reason to believe in the existence of a god, or gods, any more than to believe in the existence of an omnipotent god. That is, I would like to understand the concept of god in and of itself, and not as a wishful omen for a perfect life, or a moral compass for human action.

How is a non-existant thing like a god better than a non-existing thing like a god","Assuming god exists, one can think of the nature of god in two dimensions: is god active or passive, and is god benevolent or indifferent? Therefore, god is either active and benevolent, active and indifferent, passive and benevolent, or passive and indifferent. If god is active and benevolent, then all the bad things that happen would not happen, so this combination is unlikely. If god is active, god would likely be benevolent, so an indifferent active god seems a low probability. If god is benevolent, one would think they would be active, so a benevolent passive god seems a remote possibility. That leaves as the likeliest scenario a god that is passive and indifferent.",0.936225,0.998299,16.140125,0.999221,0.979113,4.010597,-4.165566921234131

Powers of the press

By Brendan Conway

IT’S BEEN a busy couple of weeks for the media. A spate of scandals has engulfed the big players, while the newspapers have gone to great lengths to protect their own.

These events have made the front pages, but the best stories have been the ones not in the papers at all.

Papers have been forced to cover court cases involving police misconduct, the leaking of documents and the resignation of a judge.

The stories are compelling. But they don’t sell papers.

This is why the media have to be very selective about the stories they choose to run. It’s like being a taxi driver, picking which passengers you’ll take to the airport.

The media often get stories wrong. Stories about the tax rate, for example.

This newspaper recently carried a story on a tax cut that would cost the average worker £500 a year.

We got it wrong. The story had the headline “I’ll pay more tax, says ‘average worker’”, while the article was actually about the owner of a furniture shop.

The media place a huge amount of emphasis on the fact that the average income tax rate in the UK is 40 per cent.

In fact, it’s the richest 10 per cent of households that currently pay almost half the tax.

This is a central plank in the argument for tax cuts. The government wants to cut the burden of tax on the poor.

In fact, the rich get a lower tax rate than the poor.

The media’s obsession with the tax rate ignores the fact that the richest one per cent of families pay more than half of the income tax.

And the media love to run stories about the rich people who don’t pay any tax.

But it’s the stories about the poor that sell newspapers.

What is the history of coffee?," for coffee, an essential drink in
all civilized countries.
The origin of coffee is obscure, but is thought to have come
from Central or South America, where it first grew wild. It was
first introduced to Europe in the 16th century, where it was
first called ""the devil's drink."" It was thought to be
poisonous and was used as a narcotic.

The first coffeehouse, the Café Procope, was opened in Paris
in 1686. The name is derived from ""cafetière,"" the pot or
pans in which the coffee was made.

Coffee was first brought to England by the Dutch in 1610,
and a coffeehouse was established in London in 1652. The
first coffeehouse was opened in 1703 in Saint
James's, London, and the first coffeehouse in America was
opened in 1705. The first coffeehouse in North America was
opened in Philadelphia in 1732.

Coffee first became known as a beverage in England in 1714,
when a London coffeehouse called the Blue Lion was opened.

In 1806, the first coffeehouse in Boston was opened. It was
called the Boston Coffee House, and it was founded by a
workman named John Adams. The name was derived from the fact
that the tables at the coffeehouse were made of a green wood
called ""coffee.""

The first coffeehouse in New York was opened in 1806. It was
called the New York Coffee House. The name was derived from
the fact that the tables at the coffeehouse were made of a
green wood called ""coffee.""

The first coffeehouse in Washington, D.C., was opened on
Federal Hill in 1828. The name was derived from the fact that
the tables at the coffeehouse were made of a green wood called
""coffee.""

In the 18th century, coffee was considered a gentleman's
drink. In the 19th century, coffeehouses became popular among
workingmen as places where they could get refreshments.

In the early 20th century, coffeehouses became popular as
places where people could meet and communicate with friends.

Coffee was introduced into China in the early 19th century,
where it was called wah-chung-chai. The first coffeehouse in
China was opened in 1832.

Today, some","Much of the early history of coffee was tied to oral tradition in modern-day Ethiopia. Presently, there is no evidence of coffee consumption and cultivation before the 15th century. Yemeni monks drank coffee to aid in concentration during prayers. In the early 16th century, coffee spread to the Levant and Persia. Later in the 16th-century coffee arrived in Italy via Mediterranean trade routes. The Ottomans brought it to Central and Eastern Europe. It reached India by the mid-17th century.England and Germany pioneered the coffee house concept that emerged in Western Europe. The Caribbean island of Martinique hosted one of the earliest ex-situ coffee cultivations in the New World - Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings here in 1720. These resulted in coffee plantations in other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue (which, by 1788, supplied half of the world's coffee) and also in Mexico.Brazil is currently the largest coffee producer globally, a status held since 1852. Since 1950, a number of other major producers emerged, including Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. Today, coffee is a household item as a result of modern production techniques",0.229287,0.98905,22.884574,0.987823,0.290162,5.076179,-5.842592716217041

"Thinking about public opinion, what is the significance of “issue consistency” and “levels of conceptualization”?"," is a high-level programming language for writing interpreters for a variety of data structures. It is a continuation of the ideas of John Reppy, who developed a subset of the C programming language for the JPL Moon-Shuttle project.

The current version of phia is 1.8.6. It is a general-purpose interpreter written in C with thousands of lines of code. phia has been designed to be a high-level language, with an emphasis on machine-independent programming. phia is available for use in teaching programming languages, and is available under the GNU Public License. phia can be used to write interpreters for a variety of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and hashing tables.

The language has been designed to be simple and easy to learn, while retaining the ability to express complex, high-level programs. Programs written in phia are run on the host machine using the host system's operating system, with performance comparable to a native language. Programs written in phia are also portable to other machines using the same underlying bytecode interpreter.

Pha is an interpreter; it is not a compiler. Programs written in phia can be compiled to a native machine language to provide faster execution. The compiler can be written in any language which supports a standard stack-based calling convention.

The interpreter will run a program written in phia by first loading the program into memory and then executing it. The interpreter will execute each line of the program, one instruction at a time. Each instruction is an operation on the data structure being interpreted. The interpreter may also call a function written in phia, or it may return a value written in phia.

The interpreter will also allow the programmer to pass parameters to and return results from the program, and to call subroutines written in phia.

Pha is an interpreter designed for ease of use and portability. It supports basic stack-based machine language. The interpreter can read programs written in several high-level languages, which are compiled to machine language. It can also be used as a compiler to generate native machine code.

The interpreter uses a stack to hold the current program and parameters, and an instruction pointer to keep track of the current instruction. This stack-based calling convention allows for efficient use of the stack. The interpreter also uses the stack to hold temporary data during the execution of a program.

The interpreter uses bytecode to","Issue consistency is how consistent an individual American’s opinion is about an issue and is measured in two ways. Measuring across time shows that individual Americans are not likely to have the same opinion at two different points in time.  For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn’t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.
Levels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is “ideologues”, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are “near-ideologues” who use ideological terminology, but don’t always use it correctly.  Third, are “group interest”, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.

What is a birdie in Golf,"ipedia?

A birdie is a term used in Golf and Golfing to describe a hole where the golfer executing a stroke produces a shot which shoots into the hole, without going over, and without landing in the water or touching any part of the green. This means that the ball must hop up into the air and land in the cup without hitting any of the surrounding grass or ground.

How many strokes do you need to get a birdie?

The amount of strokes needed to get a birdie depends on the type of shot that is used to get the birdie.

A three-wood shot

The shortest distance between the ball and the hole is the three-wood shot. The three-wood shot is the longest and most accurate shot into the hole. This is because the three-wood shot has the longest possible flight path. It is also the easiest stroke to execute because the golfer only has to lift the club and swing it forward. The three-wood shot is the easiest to consistently execute because it does not require the golfer to execute multiple consecutive swings to get a shot into the hole.

A wedge shot

The wedge shot is the second longest shot. The wedge shot requires a golfer to make several consecutive swings with the club. This is because the club must be swung horizontally towards the target in order to get the desired flight path.

A long shot

The long shot is the longest shot. The long shot requires a golfer to make several consecutive swings with the club. This is because the club must be swung horizontally towards the target in order to get the desired flight path.

How to get a birdie

To get a birdie, the golfer must execute a shot that lands on the green. It is important to note that not all shots are equal. The more difficult the shot, the more likely it is that the golfer will hit the ball into the cup.

The most common shot for a birdie is the wedge shot. The wedge shot is the easiest shot to play, since it only requires the golfer to lift and swing the club. This is because the wedge shot requires the golfer to only make a few consecutive swings with the club. The wedge shot is also the easiest shot to execute, since it makes use of the golfer’s muscle memory.

The second most common shot for a birdie is the three-wood shot. The three-wood shot is the second","Each hole in Golf is designated with the number of strokes it would take an expert to make to the hole. If the golfer makes it in the designated strokes it is called a Par. One stroke less than the designated will result in a Birdie. Example, for a Par 4 hole if a Golfer takes 3 strokes to get the ball in the hole, he has a Birdie.",0.00562,0.12945,18.293598,0.08009,0.004919,3.702735,-4.730738639831543
Who invented Calculus?," (which means ""sum of"") is a Greek word meaning ""sum"". Calculus is named after the Greek mathematician and philosopher, the same man who invented the number zero (see Georg Cantor). The Greek word calx means ""small"", and calculus means ""little leaps"".

In the 19th century, the word was adopted by European mathematicians. It was used in the title of Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert's 1752 book Essai d'analyse des probabilités, which means ""Essay on the analysis of chances"". In the early 18th century, the word was used in French works of the mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange.

In the 19th century, the word was used by the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, who used it to refer to the method of finding approximate solutions to polynomial equations.

The word first appeared in print in a book by the British mathematician Jacob Bernoulli (1654).

In the 19th century the word was also used in the title of the book by the British mathematician and astronomer John Herschel, which was published in 1833.

In the 18th century, the word was used in the title of a book by the French mathematician and physicist Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759).

The word entered the English language in the 19th century.

In 1820, the English mathematician William Rowan Hamilton published a book called A Treatise on the Differential and Integral Calculus of his friend and colleague the Irish mathematician Daniel Bernoulli.

The word was incorporated into the title of the book by the English mathematician and astronomer Sir David Brewster (1781-1868), who published it in 1831.

In 1823, the British mathematician and physicist George Boole published a book called An Investigation of the Laws of Thought on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities.

The word ""Calculus"" was incorporated in the title of the book by the British mathematician and physicist Charles Augustus Young (1773-1843).

In 1834, the German mathematician and physics theorist Carl Friedrich Gauss published a book under the title A Course of Pure Mathematics.

In 1836, the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788-1827) published a book called Essai sur les propri",Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz invented the foundations of Calculus at around the same time.,0.400798,0.95623,16.069552,0.983525,0.437495,3.76952,-4.809713840484619

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental disorder characterized by the development of two or more distinct identities or personalities that may or may not be aware of each other and control the individual. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is a mental disorder that involves the development of two or more distinct personalities, or identities, within one individual. To have a dissociative identity disorder means that there are different identities within one person.

Dissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental disorder that involves the development of two or more distinct personalities, or identities, within one individual. To have a dissociative identity disorder means that there are different identities within one person. Some people with this disorder may be able to remember their other personalities, but may not remember the dissociated identity or the identity that is currently dominant. The other person may also be able to remember the dissociated identity or the identity that is currently dominant.

People with dissociative identity disorder (DID) may split their personalities into different identities, or parts, that are sometimes called alters. These alters may experience different emotions, feel different sensations, feel different pain, or be different people. They may also experience different personalities, such as feeling like a different gender, or being more aggressive or sexier.

Most people with dissociative identity disorder (DID) have only one alter. They may or may not be aware that they have more than one alter. However, some people with dissociative identity disorder (DID) may be able to remember their other personalities, but may not remember the dissociated identity or the identity that is currently dominant. The other person may also be able to remember the dissociated identity or the identity that is currently dominant.

A:

Yes, you can think of the categories as the ""colors"" in a color wheel. The order you have is based on the three primary colors, and the alphabetical order is based on the secondary colors. The tertiary colors are the colors that you don't have to mix with the primary or secondary colors. 
The primary colors are the colors that you can't create by mixing the others. The secondary colors are the colors that you can't create by mixing the primary colors. The tertiary colors are the colors that you can't make by mixing the secondary colors.
Cabernet Sauvignon is a red wine (primary color), Merlot is a red wine (primary color), and so on. The other colors are more specific, like the other colors are more specific than red.

A:

The order you list is not really colour, so much as it is the ""colour wheel"" of the ""primary"" colours.  The primary colours (red, green and blue) create the colours that can be produced by mixing them and they create the colours that cannot be produced by mixing them.
So, for example, the primary colours produce yellow, red and blue.  These produce other colours when mixed (yellow, red and blue are mixed to give orange, green and purple, which are not primary colours).
Another way of thinking of it is to consider the ""colour wheel"" through the prism and it would not be surprising if some colours are on the outside of the wheel and some are on the inside.

"Given the following summary of the book ""Human Compatible"" by Stuart Russell, what is the author's proposal to overcome the limitations of the standard approach for developing AI?","a

Answer:

I think that it is important to point out that this book was written by Stuart Russell.

Russell is a good futurist. His books are widely read and are full of great ideas.

I think that Russell is an excellent scientist and philosopher who has contributed a lot to the field of AI.

However, as a philosopher, he is also very confused.

The main problem with his book is that he doesn't define what he means by ""human-compatible"" AI. This is an important issue, as the concept of human-compatible AI is incredibly vague and hard to pin down.

Russell claims that the problem with the current approach to AI is that it is ""goal-driven"", which is a way of saying that we have a goal of developing AI that can compete with human intelligence. However, the problem with this approach to AI is that it is not only difficult to define, but is also incredibly vague, as it is hard to see what the right goal is to aim for.

Furthermore, this goal-driven approach is based on a very limited understanding of intelligence as a primitive, embodied, and interactive process.

To get a better understanding of the main issues, I recommend that you read the following review of Human Compatible by one of Russell's critics:

Russell's book was not written in a vacuum. He responded to a public discussion started by Stuart Shieber (2009), in which Shieber criticized Russell for criticizing a specific research program that had been put forth by Marvin Minsky (1968). Shieber's claim was that the work of Minsky and others was a good start towards developing AI that could compete with human intelligence.

On the other hand, Russell's criticisms of Minsky's work were very broad, and he did not specify what he thought was wrong with Minsky's work. Russell's criticisms included, for example, that Minsky's work was ""goal-driven"", that it was anthropocentric, and that it was based on a simplistic understanding of human intelligence.

In response to this criticism, Shieber wrote a review of Human Compatible, in which he criticized Russell's claims about the progress of AI research, and also criticized Russell's claims about the deficiencies of Minsky's approach.

In the review, Shieber argued that the work of Minsky and others was a good start towards developing AI that could compete with human intelligence",Russell suggests that the AIs should be trained in a way that makes them gradually gain knowledge of what is truly beneficial to humans. AIs developed in this fashion would cooperate with humans while leaving them with a high enough level of autonomy.,0.02977,0.998896,16.876932,0.994577,0.028519,3.785739,-4.496761322021484

What is graph theory?," which is the study of networks or graphs. Graphs are also called networks or connections. A graph can be used to represent a network, a company, a social group, a family, a city, a country, a web, a social system, a biological system. A graph is a mathematical structure. It is composed of nodes and links. Nodes are the points of the graph, and links connect them. For example, in the graph of family relationships, the nodes are the people and the links are the relationships. Graph theory is the study of graphs. Graph theory can be applied to many scientific disciplines, such as mathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social science, and economics. Graph theory is an interdisciplinary science that combines the concepts and methods of graph theory, graph analysis, and graph drawing. Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies networks and their properties. A graph is a network consisting of nodes and links. A graph is a multidimensional object consisting of nodes or points called vertices and lines or edges called arcs. The graph is a mathematical model for studying the structure of networks. Graphs are useful in representing and analyzing systems consisting of objects, such as people or computers, that are in contact with each other and in which communication is possible. Communicating people and computers are examples of systems represented by graphs. Graphs can also be used to represent and analyze other systems, such as the electric power grid, the Internet, and the transportation system. Graphs can be used to model phenomena and systems on many levels, including the interactions of the properties of an individual (social, biological, economic, etc.) and society (social networks, social structures, and social interactions), the interactions of the properties of a group (as in the family or city), the interactions of the properties of a network (as in the Internet or the transportation system), and the interactions of the properties of the earth itself. Graphs can be used to study such phenomena as the spread of disease or the spread of rumors. Graphs can also be used to model and analyze various types of systems. A graph is represented by its vertices and edges. Vertices are the nodes of the graph. Edges are the links in the graph. Nodes and edges can join to form new graphs. A graph can have any number of nodes and edges and can have loops and multiple edges. In a graph, the vertices refer to nodes; the edges refer to lines; and the nodes are connected by the edges.

What is the best way to get faster at running long distances?,".com/courses/fast

How to run the best 5k ever? How to run a half marathon? What is the best way to get faster at running long distances?

However, after 15 years of running, I have found that there is no magic bullet. There are no shortcuts. There is no one way to get faster.

There are many factors that will influence how fast you run and how far you run. These include:

Your age and genetics

Your running style

Your training

Your diet

Your fitness level

Your fitness goals

Your motivation

Your running shoes

Your running surface

The amount of physical activity you do before or after running

Your running goals

If you want to get faster, you need to tackle each of these factors one at a time.

Age and genetics

The first thing you need to do is to understand that your age is the biggest factor in how fast you can run.

There are some runners who are fast from a young age. They are able to run for hours and miles at a time, and they don’t need to take any time off to recover.

There are also some runners who are slow from a young age. They are good runners but never go beyond 5k.

The majority of people fall somewhere in the middle.

The first thing to realise is that you should never base your running goals on how fast you can run today. The best runners I know never set a goal to run a marathon.

The main thing is to stick to a consistent training plan and see how you can get faster.

Training

The second factor that will affect how fast you run is your training.

There are some people who are naturally fast runners. They can run for hours and miles and never get tired.

They don’t need to train at all. In fact, they may tend to run too much because they’re unable to take a break.

There are other runners who are naturally slow. They never get tired and they train for hours and hours but they never get any faster. They just keep improving their times over time.

You can be one of these two types of runners.

The key to being a fast runner is to train smart.

If you’re a naturally slow runner, you need to run more often than a naturally fast runner. You should","To become faster at running requires practicing a lot of long slow distance running mixed in with occasional interval training.

What is the greenhouse effect?,"o_content_main_title"" title=""Click here to read the article."">

Introduction of the Greenhouse Effect

One of the most common misconceptions about global warming is that the Earth is heating up because of the excess amount of heat energy being absorbed by the atmosphere. The idea that the Earth is getting hotter and hotter is wrong, because the Earth is not getting hotter, it is getting cooler!

In a great article on the greenhouse effect, you will learn about the different ways in which the Earth is being cooled down, and you will find out why greenhouse activity is responsible for the cooling down of Earth’s surface.

The greenhouse effect

The greenhouse effect is the natural phenomenon in which the Earth’s atmosphere is acting as an insulator. The Earth’s atmosphere protects the surface of the Earth from the harshness of the outer space.

The Earth’s atmosphere is like a blanket that covers the Earth and keeps the surface of the Earth warm. The Earth’s atmosphere acts to trap the heat energy that is emitted from the surface of the Earth.

If there was no greenhouse effect, then the Earth’s surface would be like a furnace that would emit as much heat as it can, and the surface temperature of the Earth would increase, which would be very dangerous.

The Earth’s atmosphere acts as a blanket that keeps the Earth’s surface cool and warm, and the surface temperature of the Earth would not change.

The greenhouse effect is responsible for the Earth’s atmosphere retaining heat energy and preventing the surface temperature of the Earth from rising.

Types of greenhouse effect

There are two types of greenhouse effect:

1. Direct greenhouse effect

It is the natural phenomenon in which the Earth’s surface is being cooled by the greenhouse effect.

The direct greenhouse effect is the process by which the Earth’s surface is being cooled by greenhouse gases.

2. Indirect greenhouse effect

It is the natural phenomenon in which the Earth’s surface is being kept cool by the greenhouse effect.

The indirect greenhouse effect is a process by which the Earth’s surface is being kept cool by the reflection of light from the Earth’s atmosphere.

How the greenhouse effect works

The Earth’s atmosphere is mainly made of water vapor, CO2, and methane. The Earth’s atmosphere is made up of gases that are in the form of vapors. When the",The greenhouse effect is the process by which the sun's energy gets trapped in a planet's atmosphere and heat's the planet's surface. The energy gets trapped due to the planet's atmosphere having a higher transparency to visible radiation from the sun than it does to infrared radiation that gets emitted after bouncing off of the planet's surface.,0.12321,0.989625,17.159717,0.980927,0.100873,3.87087,-5.640713214874268

The double cutaway, long horns, three-pickup and a simplified vibrato arm integrated into the bridge plate are some of the features of the Fender Stratocaster. All of these features, with some variations, became standard in the design of electric guitars.",0.360892,0.943806,29.464962,0.93751,0.374247,6.416283,-6.700986862182617

Join me to learn about the best ways to inspire leadership using these five lessons from some of the greatest leaders of all time.
It was the summer of 1984, and I had just been accepted to Harvard Business School. My family and I planned to move to Boston in the fall. My father's old friend, Dr. Richard Gebhard, was the chairman of the firm that had hired me, and he invited me to come to his office for a meeting.
There, he told me that he was retiring that summer, and that he was going to be leaving the firm. My father asked why, and he said ""I no longer have the passion for what I am doing.""
I told him I wanted to follow him.
He said, ""Come back after you graduate from HBS and let's talk.""
I did, and in the summer of 1985, I joined his firm as a consultant.
I was given a great opportunity to learn and grow, and I have loved every minute of it.
In this talk I want to share five lessons I have learned about inspiring leadership.

One way to efficiently start learning something would be to understand the fundamentals first and dive deeper into the subtopics as you get more familiar with the core concepts. Read as much as possible and create an outline on the topic. Leverage the five Ws technique of problem solving - Who, What, When, Where and Why.

There are numerous ways to get familiarized with concepts. One way to do it would be to jot down your notes, try to make connections and try to simplify the ideas if possible. Assume that you are trying to explain this to a five year old, how would you build the topic, make it interesting either by visualizations, metaphors etc.? 

Another beneficial technique that can be of good help here, would be to put the concept into application in some form or the other. This can be done by either practicing the concepts in real life if feasible, or by observing its presence and relevance. 

Finally, try and teach the concepts to others. This is an extremely effective way to gain fluency and expertise on a subject.",0.756957,0.996081,8.960813,0.997178,0.726452,2.487496,-5.877009391784668

They are a beautiful symbol of innocence. But have you noticed there are fewer and fewer every year? When I was a kid, you couldn’t take a trip without getting some butterflies on the windshield of your car. So why are there so few and what does it mean?

One of the main reasons is the use of pesticides and herbicides. These chemicals are indiscriminate killers. And they knock the whole ecosystem out of balance. In my yard, I have seen how a little patience will put things back into balance. I had aphids, but slowly noticed aphid predators solving the problem. I had flies due to my chicken coop, but over a few weeks I saw Swallows and Phoebes move in to take advantage of the food source.

The other reason we see fewer butterflies is food for caterpillars. Most butterflies and moths (or butterflies of the night as I like to call them) need a particular plant to host their caterpillars. For Monarch butterflies, it is Milkweed (Asclepias), which is an unfortunate name for a",0.849727,0.991081,9.46855,0.939808,0.902493,2.630332,-5.5468363761901855

Who wrote Jane Eyre?,"Book Reviews: Jane EyreWho wrote Charlotte’s Web?

Charlotte’s Web by E. B. White

Charlotte’s Web by E.B. White is one of my favorite books. I know it’s not a very popular book, but I think it deserves to be. I don’t think I have ever read or heard a bad review about this book. In fact, I never read or heard anyone talk about not liking this book. I look at it as one of the classic books in children’s literature. It is the book that every child should read at least once in their lives.

Charlotte is a spider who has lost her silk producing ability. She’s been living in her barn all her life. Her life is filled with taking care of her mother and father spiders, eating the flies that bother them and doing all the chores like cleaning out the barn, keeping the mice out, and so on. All the while, the barn has been getting smaller and smaller since the flies have kept coming to eat her mother and father’s silks. One day, a veterinarian comes to see her mother and father’s webs and tells her that they’ll soon die, and that she has to move out of the barn. She takes the webs and goes to live with her aunt and uncle. Her aunt tells her that she has to earn her keep. Her aunt and uncle are farmers, so she has to do all the chores, like feeding the chickens, cleaning the barn and doing all the other farm chores. That is the beginning of a lot of hard work. In the end, the farmer has to move out of the barn, and Charlotte has to take care of the chickens, the barn and all the other farm chores.

This is a wonderful book. It makes you think. You don’t get these types of books anymore. I loved it. I wish I could read it to my children.

Who wrote Charlotte’s Web?

E.B. White wrote Charlotte’s Web. He was born in 1899, and died in 1985. He was a very talented author. He wrote more than 50 books for children and adults. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1972.

In fact, if you look at the overall responses, we can see that the first item is only answered by 29% of the respondents, whereas the second item is answered by 62% of the respondents, and the third item is answered by 76% of the respondents, and the fourth item is answered by 78% of the respondents, and the fifth item is answered by 82% of the respondents.

The results here are in line with what we have seen in the previous sections. The first item is the most difficult item for the participants. In fact, the responses to the first item seem to follow the bimodal distribution we have seen in the previous sections.

As we have seen in the analysis of the data set, the first item seems to be more difficult to answer than the others. In fact, the first item seems to be more difficult than the other four items. In particular, the first item seems to be harder than the second item. In fact, the second item seems to be the easiest item, and the first item seems to be the hardest item.

The second item seems to represent a continuum, but it is harder than the other items. This might be a result of the more difficult question.

In contrast, the third item seems to be a continuum, but it is easier than the other items. This might be a result of the easier question.

In contrast, the fourth item seems to be between the other items. This might be a result of the more difficult question.

What is the difference between AWD and 4WD?,"

AWD is the abbreviation for Antimotor-Vehicle-Differential, an automatic transmission gearbox that is comprised of two sets of gears in series, whereby the driveline has two distinct gears, one for driving front wheels and another for driving the rear wheels.

Are there different types of transmissions?

There are two types of transmissions, manual transmission and automatic transmission.

What is a manual transmission?

A manual transmission gearbox is a gearbox with a manual control lever. The gearbox has one set of gears, which drives the wheels. The gearbox is controlled by the driver by engaging the gears or by disengaging the gears.

What is an automatic transmission?

An automatic transmission is a gearbox that automatically changes gears without the need of the driver to engage the gears. The gearbox is controlled by the computer, which senses the speed and torque of the vehicle and automatically changes gears accordingly.

What is an electronic transmission?

An electronic transmission is a gearbox that is electronically controlled and automatically changes gears without the need of the driver to engage the gears.

What is a CVT?

The term CVT is an acronym for Continuously Variable Transmission, which is a gearbox that uses a continuously variable ratio mechanism that allows the vehicle to change gears without the driver having to shift the gears manually.

What is a twin clutch transmission?

A twin clutch transmission is a gearbox that has two clutches (clutch and brake) that are used in parallel to enable the gearbox to change gears without the need of the driver to shift the gears manually.

What is a continuously variable transmission?

A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is a gearbox that has two sets of gears in series, whereby the driveline has two distinct gears, one for driving front wheels and another for driving the rear wheels.

What is a manual transmission?

A manual transmission gearbox is a gearbox with a manual control lever. The gearbox has one set of gears, which drives the wheels. The gearbox is controlled by the driver by engaging the gears or by disengaging the gears.

What is an automatic transmission?

An automatic transmission is a gearbox that automatically changes gears without the need of the driver to engage the gears. The gearbox is controlled by the computer, which senses the speed and torque of the vehicle and automatically changes gears accordingly.
","AWD is a system that without driver intervention, shifts power between the rear and front wheels. This system is typically found on light-duty SUVs or passenger cars. The AWD drive system is designed for mild inclement weather conditions such as light snow, ice and rain. It is not designed for off-roading or severe weather conditions such as heavy snow or mud. This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. 

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease. The 4WD system is most commonly found on trucks, Jeeps and other purpose-built vehicles designed for heavy-duty use, whether for work or pleasure.",0.999468,0.99869,19.006906,0.996303,0.999724,4.600218,-5.418305397033691

Why do people like golf?,"a.

I am a tennis player. This is my hobby. I own two tennis courts and play tennis three times a week.

The answer to the question is that I really like playing tennis. I really like doing it. And it is a very fun competitive activity.

I am also a golfer, but I don't play it very often. The same is true of skiing and swimming.

I have not played golf in years, but I like to ski. I like to go to the zoo and ride horses. I like to go to the beach. I like to go fishing. I like to swim. I like to read. I like to play poker. I like to play pool. I like to do a lot of things that I really like to do.

These are all very fun activities. I enjoy them all. I enjoy doing them. I enjoy the people I do them with. I enjoy the activities themselves.

This is true of any sport. My friend, for example, likes boxing, but he does not do it very often. He likes to play poker, but he does not like to play it very often.

I am not a very good golfer. I can play golf, but I find that I don't enjoy it very often. I love the sport, but I am not very good at it.

What are the most important tools to own when I am an apartment renter?,".org/blog/how-to-own-your-apartment-rent-control

How to own your apartment

I found this video on Housebecomes website to be the most useful tool I’ve come across so far.

One of the first things I did after moving into my apartment was to get a copy of the property deed, as in the United States land deeds are usually public records. Before I could do anything with that document, I had to find a notary public. Once I was able to find a notary public that was willing to work with me, I was able to get that deed notarized and copy into the renters name.

The next thing I did was go to the county clerk’s office and have the document recorded.

The last step was to go to the city clerk’s office and have the city sign off on the deed. I had to go to every city clerk’s office I lived in to get this done, but I am happy to say I did it.

Once I had my lease signed by the city, I was able to take a copy of the lease, notarize it and file it with the county clerk.

I also needed a copy of the lease. I also needed to get the building manager’s signature on the lease and make sure the lease is in good standing.

The last step is to go to the county clerk’s office and have the county record the lease. It’s important to note here that some counties will charge you a fee to record the document.

I also want to mention that in some cases, you might want to have a notarized copy of the lease before you upload it to the county clerk’s office, in that case you will need to get that notarized copy from the county clerk’s office as well.

Now that I have my lease recorded, I am ready to start renting out my apartment.

If you have any questions about the process, feel free to leave a comment. -40.10 + 40. Let u = v - 0.10. Put 0.2, -1, u, -2 in increasing order.

To do these things, you’ll need a small number of tools, including:
- A standard toilet plunger, because toilets get clogged. Get this most important tool first.
- A 1” wide tape measure. Get one that’s 25ft long. The wide width makes it easier for one person to measure long runs or furniture by themselves. A 25ft length will be long enough to measure the longest wall of most rooms and any piece of furniture.

I'm sure that as a Brit you have come across the same comment made by a lot of people, but I'm not sure why you have such a problem with it. I am genuinely interested to hear your point of view on it, as I haven't come across a single woman who has said this so far.

It seems to me that the reason for the difference in the gender ratio for the Olympics is simple. Women train for two to three years longer than men. They train harder for longer and more often. This is a fact. There is no dispute about this.

I would also like to know where in the US you've heard this ""women train for two to three years longer than men."" It seems to me that the culprit is the USAFBI, which has been systematically destroying female athletes for decades now.

I'm going to be a bit hard on you, because you have managed to make this comment sound like a personal attack on the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is not what I intended.

The fact is that the women's 200 meter freestyle is a heavily weight-based event, and as a result it is harder for a female swimmer, and particularly a female swimmer who does not have the body type of an Olympic swimmer, to win that event.

I see no reason for the Olympic Committee not to have the best swimmers in the world in these events, and that is why the women's 200 meter freestyle is a lot harder to win than the men's event. That is just a fact.

It seems to me that if you are not a particularly good 200 meter freestyler, and you are an undergraduate student, you will not be able to compete in the Olympics.

What are some ways I can improve my general health during my work day?,".org

A:

The best advice I can give you is to stop thinking that you need to be doing certain things for your health.  This is because when you think that way, you're always thinking about the future, and trying to stay healthy in the present.  The future will always be there.  You need to focus on the present.  Every action that you take, you should ask yourself ""is this going to make me feel better today?"".
If you do so, then you'll realize that there are many small things that you could be doing to make yourself feel better each day.  This will make you more aware of your habits.  Finally, if you have health problems, you should see a doctor, to get any advice you need.  That way you can get the most help you can.

IgD myeloma is the second most common type of myeloma. The objective of this study was to identify the clinical features of adult IgD myeloma patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with IgD myeloma from 2000 to 2008. The patients were divided into two groups: those with hyperdiploid karyotype and those with non-hyperdiploid karyotype. The clinical features of the groups were compared. There were 26 patients with IgD myeloma, including 17 patients with hyperdiploid karyotype and 9 patients with non-hyperdiploid karyotype. The groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, and the presence of renal impairment or anemia. The hyperdiploid group was more likely to present with gastrointestinal symptoms (p=0.047), whereas the non-hyperdiploid group had a higher incidence of fatigue (p=0.002). The hyperdiploid group had a lower platelet count (p=0.041) and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase (p=0.008) than the non-hyperdiploid group. The incidence of lytic bone lesions did not differ between the groups (p=1.000). IgD myeloma is a disease that can present with varying clinical features, depending on the karyotype. Patients with hyperdiploid karyotype are more likely to have gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with non-hyperdiploid karyotype tend to present with fatigue.Blabbermouth.net -

The lake covers 5,000 acres at an elevation of about 1,300 feet (400 m) above sea level.

The lake is managed by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission as a wilderness area and a primitive area for fishing.

The lake is a popular place for fishing and boating, and has two boat ramps.

The lake has a maximum depth of 125 feet (40 m).

The following is a guest post from Mark Schmulen, who identifies himself as a “progressive fiscal and economic policy thinker.” It is reprinted with permission from Mark Schmulen.

When the Constitution was written, there were no income taxes and almost no social security, there was no Medicare and Medicaid. There was no federal income tax, and there was no federal pension law. The Constitution limited the power of the federal government, not the power of the states. The states owned everything except the federal government.

Today, the federal government controls almost every aspect of American life.

The federal government spends about $3 trillion per year and collects about $1 trillion in taxes.

Yet, the federal government’s debt is about $17 trillion. The government spends about $3,000 per taxpayer for every $1 in tax revenue collected.

The federal government spends about $2.5 trillion per year on interest on the debt.

The federal government is almost completely dependent on borrowing.

The federal government spends about $800 billion per year more than it takes in.

The federal government spends about $1.2 trillion every year on interest payments on the debt, or about $1,000 per taxpayer.

The federal government subsidizes about 24,000 different private companies, including the five largest corporations in the world.

The federal government is so big that it has a budget of about $4 trillion. It spends $2 trillion a year.

The federal government has about $18 trillion in unfunded liabilities.

The federal government has almost no ability to tax the rich. The top one percent of income earners pay over 40 percent of all federal taxes.

The federal government has the ability to tax the rich at very high rates.

The federal government spends about $750 billion per year on Medicare and Medicaid. Health care costs","Pokemon: Moltres, Pikachu, Vaporeon, Snorlax, Charizard, Charmander

University education may be inaccessible to some, so online learning is also a good choice. An example step-by-step guide:

1. Try to identify why you want to learn. Do you want to build a mobile app? Or a website? Learn how to do data analysis? Or just general curiousity. 
2. Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: 
    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)
    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)
    * JavaScript (great for website building)
3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.
4. Once completed, consider your goal from step 1. Search",0.147576,0.491917,1.9417,0.904775,0.13499,0.724192,-10.864603996276855

One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to ""Showboat"", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include ""Oklahoma"", ""The King & I"", and ""The Sound of Music"". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking ""West Side Story"", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having ""hummable"" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with ""Send in",0.001992,0.653919,2.388052,0.011886,0.001566,0.611483,-7.268957138061523
What batting traits make a good baseball or softball hitter?,".org.uk/tools/batting-traitsShortstop: good arm strength, strong hands, good bat speed, good bat control, good reads, good footwork, good range, strong arm, good glove...

Tangible evidence that NHL teams are all out to get the Sedins for some reason, and that's it. There's nothing to support it. Even if this were true, it's only part of the story. Nothing in any of the accusations can be proven or disproven. All we can do is take a look at what's actually happened, and think about the other possible reasons for the accusations.A lot of people don't understand the difference between a street legal vehicle and an
autocross vehicle. The most common misconception is that an autocross vehicle must be
track-ready. This is not true. The term ""street legal"" has nothing to do with the ability to
drive on the street or on highway. It simply has to do with the ability to register the vehicle
in a state. The vehicle must be street legal to meet state requirements. A track-ready vehicle
is street legal only if it meets the requirements of the state that you are trying to register
your vehicle in.

The term ""autocross vehicle"" is a bit confusing. The term refers to the vehicle that you
drive in an autocross competition. An autocross vehicle is a vehicle that is tuned and
modded specifically for autocross competition. The vehicle must meet all state registration
requirements in order to compete in an autocross event.

Autocross Racing Vehicles

A vehicle that is designed for autocross competition may not be street legal in your state. If
your state requires the vehicle to be street legal, then the vehicle must be street legal
regardless of whether it is autocross-ready. The vehicle must comply with all state
registration requirements.

Autocross Events

An autocross event is a competition in which the vehicle is run on the track. It is common for
the track to be a road course. The purpose of the event is to see how well a vehicle will
perform in a competitive situation. The event will generally include a number of laps around
the course. The course will be designed to give the vehicle a good ""grip"" and to present a
number of challenges. A number of times the course will be reversed so that the car can have
a second chance","There are many traits that great baseball and softball batters share.  Some of the most important are extreme confidence, sound batting mechanics, and coordination developed though a combination of talent and practice.  

All great hitters share some consistencies in their batting mechanics such as their lower half mechanics, their hand and bat path, and their head and eye movement.

With their lower half mechanics they generate powerful torque from the ground up by timing the planting their feet in a balanced position and forcefully rotating and opening their hips.  Hitting powerful line drives relies heavily on the barrel of the bat meeting the ball flush.  Batters increase the odds of this by keeping their hands in, connected to the back shoulder, and having one palm facing up and one palm facing down for as long as possible as the bat path travels through the strike zone.  Finally, all great hitters maintain consistent head and eye position throughout the motion. 

There are many nuances of batting mechanics that all great hitters share but these are some of the most important.",0.64003,0.337861,1.09179,0.020773,0.585624,0.535216,-5.875553131103516

I recently ordered one of your perfume bottles. When the bottle arrived, I was disappointed to find out that there was a crack in the glass, and that some of the contents of the bottle had leaked into the surroundings. Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for me to use the bottle, or to take it on a trip for fear of further leaks.

Is there any chance you could refund the price of the bottle, or alternatively send me a new one?

What are some criticism of Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique?,"

A:

Not much, other than that the book is a tract.  ""Feminine mystique"" is a phrase that Friedan coined.  It is a buzzphrase, like ""The Pill"", ""sexual liberation"" or ""the personal is political"".  It is not a term that's well-understood, and certainly not by the average non-academic reader.  
Friedan was a creative writer, and her book is a creative piece.  It's not a dry academic paper, but it is a book.  I'd say the book is problematic, but its author is not.  It's a problem for the reader, not for Betty Friedan.

A:

There are many criticisms of the book. The most obvious is the use of the word ""Mystique"" in the title. There is nothing mystical about the word, and it is a poor choice of word.
Another criticism is that there is little to no discussion of the problems the book actually addresses. It is primarily a celebration of the sexual liberation of the American woman, without any discussion of the feelings of the women who had become accustomed to the sexual repression of the past. This was addressed in the 1970s when the book was first published, but Friedan treated the issue as an afterthought in the original book. The book grew into a Bible of sorts for the women's movement, but was not well-received by women who had been through the sexual revolution.
There are also criticisms of the book, which you may read in the Wikipedia article.

A:

The Feminine Mystique is widely regarded as one of the most influential books of the 20th century. It has been the subject of countless scholarly studies and critiques, and continues to be a source of inspiration to many.
Yet, just a few years after its publication, Betty Friedan was rejected by her psychoanalyst, who concluded that she was psychotic from the stress of the publishing process. This was a severe blow to Friedan's self-confidence and led to a period of intense depression.
Despite the initial rejection, Friedan's influence on the women's movement has been profound. Many activists credit the book with opening their eyes to the many problems within feminism.

Scythris stellata

Scythris stellata is a moth species of the family Scythrididae. It was described by Bengt Å. Bengtsson in 2013","While groundbreaking, Betty Friedman took a narrow view on what the experience of a women is. She mainly focused on middle class white women. This narrow view meant she missed some of the challenges that women of other classes and races. As an example she focuses on the desire of women wanting to work without thinking about poorer women who are forced to work.",0.393978,0.928828,22.555904,0.980447,0.423614,5.056554,-5.352332592010498
What is email?," is email. It's how you send messages between computers that have a common protocol that is readable to the recipient. So, for example, an email server in California will be able to read an email sent from an email server in Germany.

Until roughly 10 years ago, email was a primary method of communication between businesses. Email made it easy to exchange documents and to communicate quickly and easily with people in other parts of the world.

The problem is that email is only one part of the infrastructure of the modern corporation. Email is only part of one piece of the communication puzzle: the other is instant messaging.

Messaging is the exchange of messages between two or more people using a messaging application. Messaging applications are real-time communications tools that are as common as email, and, like email, they are used for almost every kind of business communication.

The difference between email and instant messaging is that email is not real-time. Each time you send an email, the message sits in its queue, waiting for you to read it or for a recipient to read it. In contrast, instant messaging apps are real-time. Instead of reading the messages in your inbox, you can simply start a conversation.

But the real problem with email is not that it's not real-time. The problem is that it's not secure. If you send your company's confidential information to an email address, that email address, anyone in the world, can read that information.

As you can imagine, this was a problem well before the advent of social media. But social media has exacerbated the problem by making it easy to post confidential information to social media.

Just as email is the primary method of communication for many companies, instant messaging is the primary method of communication for many companies. But like email, instant messaging has many drawbacks.

Instant messaging applications are not secure

Because instant messaging apps are real-time communication tools, they are not, strictly speaking, secure communications tools. The apps do not encrypt the messages. In fact, they often do not encrypt the communications at all. Instead, they encrypt only the media — the actual text of the communication — which means that anyone in the world who comes across the email or instant message can read your communications.

This is an extremely serious problem, because the communications are not encrypted. This means that if your company's communications are intercepted, your company's communications can be read.

Because of this, instant messaging has become","Email is form of electronic communication that is distributed between computers over closed and open networks.  The internet is the most common network that is used for email communication.  Email services that are very popular are gmail, outook, protonmail, and yahoo mail.

How did George II die," to elite.

He had a strong constitution and, in spite of his illness, he took to his bed but his condition worsened in the late summer and early autumn of 1751. The king's physician, Dr. Thomas Willis, was summoned to his bedside and he prescribed a regimen of vigorous exercise to help improve his circulation and thus the circulation of the blood. This did not help so he prescribed a diet of buttermilk, beef, and oatmeal; he also had to give up alcohol. The king was also offered grapes, baked apples, ginger, and turnips. A physician friend of the king, Dr. William Smellie, wrote:

> To the king about this time I mentioned that I thought his constitution was much deranged by the use of spirits, and he desired me to tell him what could be done in the case. I told him, that I thought if he took every grain of the sacred grapes he would find the dropsy would soon be done. He asked me what quantity of the grapes I thought he should eat. I told him that I thought he should eat the whole of the first crop of grapes. He seemed to be pleased with my advice, and said he would endeavour to follow it.

This was a typical case of the hot-cold disease. The king's condition worsened and he began to have difficulty breathing. On November 5, 1751, he was taken to London and put on a different regimen that consisted of more than buttermilk, beef, and oatmeal. He was also given more fruits and vegetables. Dr. Willis had given up alcohol but on December 15 George II began to drink a cup of wine and brandy and a small amount of cordial every day. On December 21 he was well again and was sent back to St. James's.

The king suffered a relapse in December, but he recovered. When he was well again, he cabled his brother, the Prince of Wales, that he was ""not to be gambled with but be most careful of your health and you will be most welcome to me."" He was visited by his old friend, the Duke of Hamilton. He wrote on his visit:

“You know, this whole thing is so, so funny. I don’t think the world is going to end. I think it’s going to be great.”

“The only way to make something like that happen is to have a huge amount of faith in your own ability and to have a huge amount of determination to make something like that happen.”

“I think it’s more likely that we’re all living on a computer simulation than that we’re not. I think that’s probably the most likely scenario.”

"Classify each of these car manufacturers as either French, German, American, Japanese, or other: Lexus, Hyundai, Alfa Romeo, VW, Honda, GM, Citroen",", Toyota, Suzuki, Kia, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, and Fiat.

The results are striking. French manufacturers dominate, with Lexus and Alfa Romeo among the top five. German manufacturers are the second-largest group, followed by American, Japanese, and other. The leading French manufacturer in first-time buyers is Lexus, with Hyundai second. Other car makers are well down the list.

One reason might be that the French are more likely to have bought a second car in the last three years, but the differences between the countries are not purely due to this. There are also differences in consumer culture, and in the car-buying mentality. The French tend to be more optimistic about their future and attitudes to money are more positive. This, in turn, leads to more car purchases in France than elsewhere.

The differences in consumer culture are also important, because they mean car companies can target different consumers in different countries. They can do this in two ways. First, they can give their products different names and identities. For example, in Britain, Audi and VW tend to be favoured by young, trendy buyers. Conversely, in France, Citroen and Peugeot are favoured by more conservative, older buyers. In Japan, Toyota and Honda tend to be favoured by the more affluent, while Nissan and Lexus are favoured by the less well-off.

Second, car companies can target different kinds of buyers. In France, Lexus is a favourite of 'gentleman drivers', a label the brand has tried to shake off in recent years. The brand has made a concerted effort to attract younger buyers, including a well-publicised ad campaign for its new JX models.

In Germany, Volkswagen is the brand of choice for the young, trendy, and well-off. Its 'people carrier' is the successful Golf. In Britain, Ford has been a key brand for young people who don't want to be tied down to a family car.

In America, Cadillac is the flagship brand, while Nissan is the 'people carrier'.

The British get a car for the family. The Japanese get one for the wife. The French get one for the husband. The Germans get one for the wife. The Americans get one for the wife and the husband.

How can Bernoulli's principle be derived from Newton's second law of motion?,". 2014.

A:

Newton's third law for rotational motion is:
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = m\boldsymbol{a}_k$
where $\boldsymbol{F}_k$ is the force acting on the $k^{th}$ particle and $\boldsymbol{a}_k$ is the acceleration of the $k^{th}$ particle.
Now, if we apply the same principle to rotational motion, we have:
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{r}_k\times\boldsymbol{r}_k = m\boldsymbol{a}_k$
$\boldsymbol{r}_k\times\boldsymbol{r}_k = m\boldsymbol{a}_k$
or
$\boldsymbol{a}_k = \frac{\boldsymbol{F}_k}{m}$
and
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = m\boldsymbol{a}_k$
therefore,
$\boldsymbol{a}_k = \frac{\boldsymbol{F}_k}{m}$
Applying this to our first equation, we get:
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = m\boldsymbol{a}_k = m\frac{\boldsymbol{F}_k}{m} = \boldsymbol{F}_k$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{F}_k$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
That implies $\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$
i.e.,
$\boldsymbol{F}_k = \boldsymbol{0}$

What are the top attractions to visit in Cancun?,".by

I was born and raised in Cancun, so visiting the city is a very special and unique experience for me. I am so glad that I am able to share this and other beautiful places with you.

The city of Cancun is a relatively small and easy to navigate, which makes it an ideal place to visit for the first time. It is located in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, on the Caribbean coast, and is very close to the Belize border. The majority of the area is covered by the Mayan culture and tradition, which makes it a very special place to visit.

The city is famous for its many beaches and crystal clear waters, which are perfect for diving or snorkeling. This is the main reason why the city attracts a lot of tourists. There are also plenty of other things to do in Cancun, such as shopping, dining, and nightlife.

If you are looking for a place to stay in Cancun, please feel free to use my Airbnb link to rent one of the best condos in the city.

Top Attractions in Cancun

Hitting the Beach

The main attraction in Cancun is without a doubt the beaches, which are some of the most amazing in the world. The city is well known for its white sandy beaches, crystal clear waters, and calm waters.

The beaches in Cancun have names that are very easy to remember, such as Boulevard Kukulcán, Tulum, and Arrecifes. All of these beaches are located on the Caribbean coast, and are considered the most beautiful in the world.

You can easily spend a couple of hours on these beaches, and you can see why people love to spend their vacations in Cancun.

Shark Reef

Shark Reef is one of the most visited attractions in the city of Cancun. It is a perfect place to snorkel and dive, and it also offers a beautiful view of Cancun’s surrounding areas. The waters are crystal clear, and the coral reefs are so diverse.

The park is located right on the Caribbean coast, just a short drive away from Cancun. It","Cancun is divided into two areas. Downtown, also known as Ciudad Cancun — and Cancun Island, also known as The Hotel Zone or “Zona Hotelera”. The Hotel Zone is the primary tourist area, synonymous with resorts, catamarans, wild nightlife and beaches. It’s a 15-mile strip of sand shaped like the number seven. This is where most people stay.

As the name implies, there are tons of hotels as well as most of the nightlife and beaches. Restaurants and bars line the only road, Kulkukan Boulevard, which runs from one side of the Hotel Zone to the other.

what is elasticsearch?,"elasticsearch is an open source search engine, based on Apache Lucene, it can be used to create a searchable index of your data.how does elasticsearch work?it is a client-server based search engine, elasticsearch uses Lucene for the index, as well as its query engine.what are the components of elasticsearch?its main components are: the elasticsearch daemon, which is responsible for starting, managing, and stopping the search cluster.the elasticsearch index, which stores your data in the form of an index.the elasticsearch query engine, which is responsible for querying the index.

we will be using elasticsearch to demonstrate the use of the elasticsearch library.

elasticsearch library

the elasticsearch library provides a common interface for interacting with elasticsearch.

elasticsearch library uses a RESTful API, the following code shows how to create an index:

importorg.elasticsearch.client.Client;importorg.elasticsearch.client.RestClient;importorg.elasticsearch.client.RestHighLevelClient;

publicclassCreateIndex {

publicstaticvoidmain(String[]args)throws Exception{

Client client =newRestHighLevelClient(

newURL(""http://localhost:9200""));

client.createIndex(""hugedb"", ""book"");

}

}

the above code creates an index called ""hugedb"" with the name ""book"", using the http://localhost:9200 as the base path.

the elasticsearch client also supports filtering the index, you can add a filter to the query by using the following code:

client.prepareSearch(""hugedb"").setQuery(

""query"",

""hugedb"").setSize(10).setFilter(

""term"",

""dog"").execute().actionGet();

the above code is using the org.elasticsearch.client.indices.prepareSearch method to create a search request, the client.prepareSearch method takes a path as an argument. The above code is using the org.elasticsearch.client.indices.prepareSearch method to create a search request, the client.prepareSearch method takes a path as an argument.

"In relation to working out, what is a bench press, and how do you perform it?","_barnett

Todays workout was the bench press. I started with a dumbbell bench press, and then I progressed to a barbell bench press. I used a barbell that is 70lbs for the barbell bench press. I would say that this was an intermediate level workout because I was using the barbell. I could only use the barbell for about 2 reps before I was too tired to continue. I could only do 10 reps at the most. The last exercise I performed was the incline dumbbell curl. I performed this exercise for 3 sets of 10 reps.

I would say that the incline dumbbell curl is a beginner level exercise because the incline bench is the higher level exercise.

In relation to working out, what is a bench press, and how do you perform it?

the bench press is a chest exercise that involves the upper body, specifically the pectoral muscles, the shoulders and the triceps. Its a basic exercise that involves the chest muscles such as the pectoral muscles, the deltoids, the triceps and the scapula.

the bencher bench press is a specific exercise that involves the upper body and the muscles in the upper back. Its an isolation exercise that involves the chest muscles.

After the declaration of independence in 1949, the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed the Flag of Northern Ireland Act of 1949, the Orange Order, Ulster loyalism, and the Blue Triangle Campaign all opposed the introduction of a flag of Northern Ireland. The Act specified that the Union Flag could be flown on the Parliament Buildings and on the official residence of the Governor of Northern Ireland, the Flag of Northern Ireland was formally introduced in 1952, with the Union Flag being flown alongside it. The Orange Order protested and marched along the route for the opening ceremony, in 1954, the Flag of Northern Ireland Act was passed, which allowed the use of the Union Flag alongside the Northern Ireland flag in the civic centre of Belfast.

Why do so many people live along coastlines?,"ocoastline.com/

A:

The answer is pretty simple.
From the coastal location to the coast you have to go through a lot of water.
Water is a very good conductor of heat.
The coasts are hotter than the land because they are often surrounded by water.
The water also holds the heat from the sun, which is radiated onto the coast.
It is lighter than the land, so it floats on the surface of the water.
The surface is a good conductor of heat.
So if you are near a coast, you will have a higher temperature than if you are inland.

Inhibitory effect of orexin on the activity of rat mast cells and the secretion of histamine and leukotrienes.
Orexin, a neuropeptide composed of two peptides, orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB), is a recently identified hypothalamic neurotransmitter. Orexin neurons project to sympathetic and parasympathetic preganglionic neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord. These preganglionic neurons transmit the signals to various types of peripheral and central neurons including those in the autonomic nervous system. To study the physiological role of orexin in mast cells, we examined the effect of orexin on the secretion of histamine and leukotrienes from rat mast cells. We found that orexin A and orexin B dose-dependently inhibited the release of both histamine and leukotrienes from rat peritoneal mast cells stimulated with compound 48/80. This inhibition was reversed by a selective orexin receptor 1 antagonist, SB334867. The inhibitory effect of orexin on the release of histamine and leukotrienes was associated with the degranulation of mast cells. In addition, the inhibition of the release of histamine and leukotrienes by orexin was attenuated by a selective orexin receptor 1 antagonist, SB334867, or an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, BAPTA-AM, or a selective phospholipase C inhibitor, U73122. These data suggest that orexin inhibits the release of histamine and leukotrienes from rat mast cells through a mechanism involving both the intracellular Ca(2+) response and phospholipase C. The physiological significance of this finding is that orexin may play a role in the regulation of the immune system, especially in allergic diseases.Healthy Foods

In addition, temperature differences are much more mild near the ocean compared to temperatures in the same region but farther inland.

This is a nice example of how to use the handy self.method() function. See the previous tutorial.

It can also be used outside of class.

>>> def dostuff():
... ... print 'hello'
... ...
>>> d = dostuff
>>> d.method()
hello
>>>

Another method of the class is the __getattr__ function.

def __getattr__(self, name):
return getattr(self, name)

You can use this to access the attribute in a ""special"" way.

>>> class A(object):
... ... def __init__(self):
... ... self.aString = ""test""
... ...
... ... def __getattr__(self, name):
... ... print name
... ... return getattr(self, name)

>>> d.aString
test
>>> d.aString.method()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>

>>>

An important tool is the getattr function.

>>> getattr(d, 'aString')
test
>>>

The self.method function can be used inside the getattr function:

>>> getattr(d, 'aString')
test
>>>

You can also get the attributes of a class, like this:

>>> d.class.attribute
test
>>>

But when you want to get the attribute of a method, you need to give the name of the method.

>>> d.class.method.attribute
test
>>>

If you want to get the attribute of a function, you must give the name of the function.

>>> d.class.method.function.attribute

If you want to get the attribute of a class, you need to give the class.

>>> d.class.method.class.attribute

What was Robert Metcalfe's impact on society?,"

Robert Metcalfe was an influential scientist who founded the key research institute that helped to create the Internet. His work was a major milestone in the development of the Internet and the computer world as a whole.

Metcalfe was born in 1944 in Epsom, England. His father was a scientist, and Metcalfe grew up in a large home with many pets. He was a good student and went on to study at the University of Cambridge. In the summer of 1967 he met a young man named Douglas H. Clark, who was a graduate student in computer science. Clark had established a research group at the University of Manchester, and Metcalfe was interested in joining. He came to Manchester, but shortly thereafter transferred to the University of Edinburgh to continue his studies. In 1970, he and Clark co-founded the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California.

PARC became a hotbed of research and development in computer science, and Metcalfe was a key figure in the success of the center. Metcalfe's work at PARC helped to create the Ethernet, the first software-defined computer network and the first user-friendly network interface for personal computers. Metcalfe also helped to develop the Ethernet's successor, the Internet.

In the early 1980s, Metcalfe left PARC and returned to England to found a consulting company called Logic Systems. He founded Metcalfe Systems in 1983 and later added a provision for computer networking. His company did a great deal of work for the British government, the National Health Service, and several other organizations.

Robert Metcalfe died of a heart attack in June of 2003. He was only 66 years old.

Metcalfe was also a strong supporter of free speech. He believed that all people should be free to say what they want without being criticized and that people should be able to pursue their own interests in life.

Metcalfe's most important contribution to society was in the realm of computer science. He helped created the Ethernet, a network protocol that allowed for the easy transfer of data between computers. He also helped to create the Internet, which revolutionized the world of information.

Robert Metcalfe's impact on society was immense. He worked to create the technology that made the Internet possible. He also helped to create a free and open society, where anyone can say or do anything without being criticized.

What kind of language is Shauraseni Prakrit,"? I have been wondering about that for a long time.

A:

Note that Prakrit is not the same as modern Indian languages, such as Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, etc. 
It is the language of the Vedic scripture.
It is believed that Vedic language was the language of the God's communication with the planet, and it is the language of the Vedas.
So, it is a language of the ancient times.
The language is extinct now. But you can see some verses in some Vedic scripture in modern Sanskrit, which is the language of the modern scripture.
However, the language (Prakrit) is not extinct at all.
For example, there are some books in the world, which are written in Prakrit. For example, the book of Bhagavad Gita is written in Prakrit. And, the book of Ramayana is also written in Prakrit.
So, you can see that the language is not extinct at all.

A:

Just to add to @Yukkuri's answer, since the question is already closed, I'd like to add that Shauraseni is the language that was spoken in the land of Shauraseni in the ancient times.
In fact, the word Shauraseni was used in the Vedic period, and Shauraseni was the name of the first people of the land.

Shauraseni was the name of the first people of the land.

And, according to the book called 'Shauraseni Mahabharata',

First, Shauraseni was the first king of the land.

So, the word Shauraseni is the name of the first king of the land.
So, when we see the word Shauraseni, it is the ancient name of the land, and Shauraseni was the language of the ancient people of the land.

That's not a common trait among German Shepherds. Actually, my parents' dog was German Shepherd and I was the only one she ever showed signs of aggression towards. So, I'm not sure where your parents' dog picked up on those signs of aggression.

Not necessarily. My parents' dog was a German Shepherd and he was a great dog. My mother was able to train him during her childhood and he became a great dog. But, my father had to train him. He said that he would have to re-train him every time he wanted him to do something.

He also told me that he would have to re-train him when he wanted him to go to the bathroom in the house. My father said that he had to take the dog outside and use his bathroom.

My father trained my mother to take the dog outside so that he could use the bathroom. After that, though, he could let her take him outside to go to the bathroom.

My father also trained my mother to take him out for a walk so that he could go to the bathroom.","British Shorthairs are an easygoing, quiet and dignified breed.

Q:

Reverse engineering an existing Windows Forms Application

I've been tasked with reversing an existing Windows Forms Application in Visual Studio.  I've been able to get the .exe up and running, but I've been having a lot of trouble getting the source.  I've tried using Reflector and I've also tried using the Snoop tool.  I'm not sure if it's the source code that the application is using, but it's not the .NET 4.0 source.  It's a WinForms application with some controls that I have no idea where it's getting it.  
I'm not sure if this is a .NET 4.0 issue, or a Visual Studio issue.  I've tried a few things but my knowledge in just reverse engineering is pretty limited.  Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks!

A:

The easiest way to do this is to hand off the project to someone else. They can use Reflector to get the source (and if they can't, then just hand it off to someone who can). Then they can modify the source as they see fit and then hand it back to you.
Alternatively, you can use a tool like NDepend to get a high-level view of what is in there. This is actually a pretty good tool for this sort of thing.

[Effect of different levels of the body surface electro-conductivity in rats on the impulse activity of the visual cortex neurons].
It is shown that the impulse activity of the visual cortex neurons in anesthetized rats increases with increasing level of electro-conductivity of the body surface under the conditions of hyperoxia, convulsion and diazepam injection. It is assumed that the increase of the electro-conductivity of the body surface under the action of convulsion and diazepam results in the inhibition of the impulse activity of the visual cortex neurons. It is concluded that the impulse activity of the visual cortex neurons is under the control of the electro-conductivity of the body surface.

Why Rafael Nadal succeeds on clay?," or a clay-court specialist?s success depends on various factors. A player can?t be great on clay, but there are a few different things that can be done to improve the surface. The first is to practice on a clay court in a tournament setting. Another way is to play on a soft red clay in practice. This soft red clay is basically an outdoor court where the clay has been mixed with sand, so it doesn?t have the same texture as natural clay. The sand in the red clay stops the ball from sticking to the surface, and therefore slows down the ball?s speed. It also helps to improve the ball?s grip on the surface. If you play on this type of clay in a tournament setting, the ball is going to be more difficult to control, but if you can play on it you may be able to make some adjustments that will help you get the ball to stick to the surface. Another way to improve on clay is to practice on a hard court, using a racquet similar to the one you will use on clay. This type of racquet will allow you to hit with more spin, which will help your ball get up off the court. If you can mold your strokes to the ball?s speed, you can make the ball come off the court in a more consistent manner. That?s the reason why Rafael Nadal is so successful on clay. He starts by practicing on natural clay, and then plays on a racquet similar to the one he will use on the clay court.

Flat and Hard

Rafael Nadal is a clay-court specialist. Even though he has played on hard courts in the past, he is very comfortable on clay. He has been able to adjust his game and make it work on harder courts, but he still has a game that can?t be replicated on a harder surface. Rafael Nadal?s game is a little bit unique. He hits a lot of topspin on his ground strokes, giving him a lot of control on the ball. He also hits a lot of backspin on his ground strokes, so he can delay the ball and keep it on the court. This is what makes him so effective on clay. His forehand and backhand work well on clay, but his forehand serves are a little off on hard courts. This is because of the way he hits the ball, which is with a lot of topspin. Rafael Nadal doesn?t have a very strong serve. He has","Rafael Nadal on clay is like a Grand Theft Auto game with the 'Infinite Ammo' cheat code enabled. Several have compared the Spaniard displaying his prowess on the red dirt to Picasso painting a live mural, Ennio Morricone producing a melody exactly congruent with the scenario, or Jorge Lorenzo posting similar times lap after lap in an almost mechanical yet fluid approach.

Rafael Nadal's ability on clay is mostly due to the surface itself. This may appear to be a quip, but the particular qualities of claycourts - which distinguish them from grass and hardcourts - are a fundamental reason why Rafael Nadal has dominated the surface the way he has.

What distinguishes clay? It's sluggish and bouncy. Fundamentally, clay reduces the speed of the ball once it bounces on the surface. Of course, there's more to it than just making the game slow and monotonous, but that's the distinguishing quality of a claycourt.

The surface is also less skiddish than grass or hard, allowing the ball to bounce high, which suits Rafael Nadal's high topspin-based game.",0.410666,0.998704,22.108555,0.996606,0.506773,5.004261,-3.7087292671203613
Why is the rover called Perseverance?,", whose answer is a story about what he calls ""the rover's mission,"" to determine whether the area is habitable. How does the rover do that?

In 1971, NASA launched the first Mars rover, Spirit and Opportunity, to the red planet. The two rovers are still exploring the Martian surface. They have been collecting data since January 2004.

The rovers' names are taken from the biblical Book of Revelation and the Book of Joshua. They are part of the Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) Project, which is an ongoing effort to explore the red planet.

The mission of the Mars Exploration Rover, or MER, Project is to determine whether the area is habitable.

The Opportunity rover landed on Mars on January 25, 2004. It began exploring the Martian surface in 2004.

The rover's name comes from the Book of Joshua, where Joshua had to lead Jewish people in battles with the people of Canaan.

The rover was scheduled to go into its first winter hibernation in March, but it didn't.

The rover has been on Mars for more than five years.

Please give me 3 reasons why Ronaldo is the best player in the world from this text,"

Ronaldo has never been in a team that have been able to keep him. He doesn't have a dream team with Ibra and Rooney, he has to play for the best team in the world, for the best club in the world, with the best players in the world. He never had that situation.

Ibra is the best player in the world but he's a team player, he works for the team, for the club, for the country, for the world.

Rooney is the number one player in the world but he's a team player, he works for the team, for the club, for the country, for the world.

Bale is the number one player in the world but he's a team player, he works for the team, for the club, for the country, for the world.

Ronaldo is the number one player in the world but he's a team player, he works for the team, for the club, for the country, for the world.

I wouldn't say he's a team player. He's simply a selfish player. He doesn't have a problem with playing for the number one club in the world or playing for the number one player in the world. He doesn't care about the team, he doesn't care about the club, he doesn't care about the country. He only cares about getting the goals and scoring the goals. He's a selfish player and he'll never be a team player.

What is the history of Afrobeats?,": a.k.a. African Rhythm, a.k.a. Afrobeat, a.k.a. Afrogirl: cut to the chase, she'll keep you on your toes.noun: a.k.a. Afrobeat, a.k.a. Afrogirl, a.k.a. Afrofuturism, adjective: a.k.a. Afrian, a.k.a. Afrobeat, a.k.a. Afrofuturism

The history of Afrobeats? is a very young history. It was born after the 2009 presidential election in Nigeria, when the singer and producer, Olamide, was already well on her way to becoming a household name.

Olamide, who's from the northern city of Ogun State, had always been a music aficionado, but it was 2008 when she decided to put it all on the line and start a career in music.

""I was into music and I wanted to get into music,"" she said. ""I thought it was high time I started and started off with music.""

Olamide, who released her debut album, ""Mama Afrika,"" in 2010, had to endure the pains of starting out as a musician.

""I started off making music and I was just singing in the car,"" she said. ""I just released my first album and I was just doing it.""

Soon after the release of her debut, Olamide was approached by a DJ, who suggested that she come to Lagos and perform at a music festival.

""He said, 'If you want to sell your album, you have to come to Lagos and perform at this festival,'"" Olamide said. ""So I came there and I did the song, 'Oyinbo,' and I got to perform that song.""

Since then Olamide has been on a roll. Her debut album went on to be certified platinum and she won awards like ""Best Female Act,"" ""Best New Act,"" ""Best Dance Act,"" and ""Best Musical Act."" She was also nominated for ""Best Female Act"" at the 2011 Africa Music Awards.

Her second album, ""Fear of God,"" went platinum again, and Olamide released the album in 2011.

""It was my second album and I just wanted to take it to another level,"" Olamide said. ""It was","Afrobeats (not to be confused with Afrobeat or Afroswing), or Afro-pop or Afro-fusion (or Afropop or Afrofusion), is an umbrella term to describe popular music from West Africa and the diaspora that initially developed in Nigeria, Ghana, and the UK in the 2000s and 2010s.

Genres such as hiplife, jùjú music, highlife and naija beats, among others, were amalgamated under the 'Afrobeats' umbrella.",0.566655,0.994909,15.938704,0.994202,0.609651,3.820824,-4.851278305053711

With her brother-in-law out of town, Lisa had agreed to watch her niece Stella for the afternoon and the little girl was known to be a bit of a handful. Her plan had been to spend the afternoon at the park to let Stella run and climb, to wear her out a bit.  Unfortunately, this outing was foiled by the constant downpour of rain so Lisa resigned herself to a day inside with the tiny tyrant. Stella arrived early and excited to play.  Lisa decided to begin with a game of hide and seek, after all this could take up a good part of the morning without too much trouble.  Stella ran off to hide and Lisa sat quietly drinking coffee while calling out to the little girl, pretending to seek. Eventually she set off to find the little girl but soon she realized that something was wrong.  No matter where she looked, Stella was nowhere to be found.

Give me exactly 5 characteristics of award winning songs.,". I'd like to hear a generic list of things that I should include in my songwriting. I need to hear a lot of different things. I like to hear about how people are feeling!

""The craft of songwriting is an art form, and the most important thing is to be able to communicate what you want to say."" -- Paul Simon

""It is important to have a sense of balance in one's life and to not get too caught up in what you are doing. And to never forget to write a song."" -- Carrie Newcomer

""Songwriting is like a little bit of magic. There is this invisible barrier between the writer and the listener. And I think it's important to overcome that barrier in some way."" -- Paul Simon

""I hope that once I am a famous songwriter that I will be able to pay for the medical bills of my drug addict father."" -- Mike Love

""The song is a part of the whole. There is no such thing as a song. A song is a song. The words, the music, the arrangement, the performance, the recording -- it's the sum of all of these elements."" -- Paul Simon

""A first draft is always better than a finished song."" -- Paul Simon

""We have to learn how to be thankful for what we have, and to appreciate that things are good when they are."" -- Carrie Newcomer

""I don't like to waste a single minute of the day. I spend as much time as I can doing things I love. I love to write, and I love to sing. I was lucky enough to be able to do both of those things when I was younger."" -- Carrie Newcomer

""I think the best thing you can do is just write songs. There are so many things you can do with music. I could teach you how to play the piano, but I wouldn't teach you how to write songs. It's a much more valuable thing."" -- Carrie Newcomer

""I think the secret, a lot of times, is that you don't have to be a genius to be a writer. Everyone has an opinion, and every opinion is valuable. People don't have to listen to you, but if you listen to them, they will pay attention to you."" -- Paul Simon

""The words have to be good. The words have to be true. But the words are not the most important thing. You","Popular songs that usually win awards have some common characteristics:
1. A catchy chorus that people can sing-a-long with
2. A simple beat that can be clapped along with or danced to

4. An instrument solo or prolonged period of instrumental-only music

The first attention to these beautiful rock formations was broad in 1923 by Frank A. Wadleigh. Devils Garden(known as Klondike Bluffs today) got its name from a prospector from Salt Valley Alexander Ringhoffer, Devils Garden was transposed to an area on the opposite side of Salt Valley. Landscape Arch is the longest arch in the park and the fifth longest in the world! 
In 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed a presidential proclamation creating the Arches National Monument to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and other sandstone formations for their scientific and educational value. The name Arches was suggested by Frank Pinkely, in 1925. From 1938 multiple presidents of the United States of America signed multiple proclamations to protest scenic features and permits for road constructions in order to attract tourists into the area but only in 1972 Arches National Park was officially created.

What is the best smartphone on the market?,".de/Biggest-phone-ever-made

When you need a smartphone, you will need to decide between the biggest and best. And the best smartphone on the market is the iPhone 6.

The first thing you notice about the iPhone 6 is its size. Apple has never had a phone that small before – it’s almost impossible to find a case that will fit the iPhone 6. And the iPhone 6 is even more powerful than the iPhone 5S, which was considered one of the best smartphones on the market.

The iPhone 6 is the best smartphone on the market because it has a better design and it can be made much smaller than a phone like the Galaxy S5. It has a much better camera, and it is more powerful than other phones with bigger screens.

The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch screen, meaning it is the biggest screen on the market. Other smartphones have 4.0-inch or 4.5-inch screens, but only the iPhone 6 has one that is this big.

The iPhone 6 has been out for a few months now, but the iPhone 6 Plus is coming soon. It has an even bigger screen – 4.7-inches, so it is even bigger than the iPhone 6.

You can read more about the iPhone 6 and other phones on our bigphone.de website.

The Big Phone is pretty big – it is about 3.5-inches thick. It’s not much bigger than a 20″ TV, but it is about the same size as a regular tablet.

Big Phone is a newer company, having only been in business for a few months. But they have already sold thousands of Big Phones, and they have been featured on many news sites.

The main thing that makes the Big Phone different from other smartphones is its size. Big Phone is the only smartphone that can be used as a tablet while it is in your pocket.

The Big Phone’s screen is about 6 inches wide, and it is covered with a layer of glass that makes it look like a TV screen.

It's a bit of a cliché to say that whenever your friend has a new dog, he or she invariably becomes a dog person. But, to be honest, I think it's an understatement.

My friend's new dog, a golden retriever, is just the most beautiful dog I've ever seen. She's small, athletic, and beautiful. She's also extremely loving and affectionate, and she has a beautiful, expressive face. She's got a great sense of humor, too.

This new love of hers isn't just limited to her dog. She's also had a cat for a while now, and she used to have a rabbit. But now there's no room for that kind of love in her life. It's all about the dog.

These days, she's thinking about getting a dog of her own. But, of course, I know she's got to take it slowly.

I'm happy to say that I've learned something from this about dogs. I've learned that I can't have too many dogs.

I'm not saying that I want to have 50 dogs in my house. I've got a houseful right now, and I'm happy with that.

But I think I'm learning that I just can't have too many dogs.

What do you think?

A. There's no way I could possibly have too many dogs.

The start of March marks the beginning of the year, and the time when all of the zodiac signs will get together for a full turn around the sun. You may be feeling the effects of the sun’s movement, as it is the time of year when the light of the sun has the most power over us. The mid-point of the year, however, is the time when the sun has the least power. It is time for the zodiac signs to shift into a new gear, and for the new years to begin.

Aries are a fire sign, which is why they are the first of the zodiac signs to arrive. They are also ruled by Mars, and are the only sign to have Mars as their rulership planet. The fire sign of Aries is also the sign of the younger son, and is ruled by the star Sirius. Aries are the most direct of the zodiac signs, and need to know and be who they are. They are passionate, energetic, and fearless, and need to use these traits to their advantage.

The beginning of the year is a good time to get a resolution made and a new beginning started. Aries also like to be challenged, and will be happy to take on the role of leader in the beginning of the year. They like to be in control, and will not tolerate anything but. If you are the leader in your group, and you are not taking charge, you may want to reconsider your role. Aries are not one to make a decision unless they are 100% certain that they are making the right choice.

Aries are ruled by their own star, Mars, and are very strong and independent. They are passionate, and can be rebellious and stubborn at times. They can also be outspoken, and sometimes need to learn to change their ways and be more considerate. They like to be in control, and will not tolerate anything less. They may be a little hot-headed and may push people too far.

When the United States hosted the 1999 Women's World Cup, the team was ranked No. 1 on the planet. The Americans topped the group, then faced China, Sweden and Norway in a Round of 16 matchup. The Americans, however, lost 3-1, the scoreline attributable to goalie Briana Scurry's 3rd-minute goal. The Americans would go on to lose 2-0 to Japan in the quarterfinals before falling to China in the semifinals, 2-1, in overtime.

What are some types of sorting algorithms?," sorting

I have a simple array of integers, and I need to sort it by the second number, which is always in the middle of the array). I have been able to sort it with a bubble sort, but I would like to sort it with a quick sort if I can, because it would be faster. Is there a method in C to sort an array of integers by the second value in the array?

A:

If you want to sort an array by the second element, you could do
sort(array, n+1, array + n, cmp_func);

where n is the total number of elements and cmp_func is a comparison function that returns an integer, zero if the first element is equal to the second, otherwise negative if the first element is less than the second.
If you want to sort the array by the middle element, you could do
sort(array, n/2, array + n, cmp_func);

where n is the total number of elements and cmp_func is a comparison function that returns an integer, zero if the first element is equal to the second, otherwise negative if the first element is less than the second.
If you want to sort the array by the third element, you could do
sort(array, n/3, array + n/3, cmp_func);

where n is the total number of elements and cmp_func is a comparison function that returns an integer, zero if the first element is equal to the second, otherwise negative if the first element is less than the second.
Further, if you want to order the array by the nth element (where n is the total number of elements), you could do
sort(array, 0, n-1, cmp_func);

Gaming Retrospective: 2011

This is a retrospective of sorts, about the gaming industry in general and the year 2011 in particular. I'm doing this retrospective because I feel it is a good time to look back and evaluate 2011 from a different perspective.

E3

I remember very little about E3 2011. I was so excited for Halo 4 that I couldn't pay attention to the other games, which was unfortunate. Maybe I'll do a Halo 4 retrospective later. I remember the Nintendo presentation, though. I don't remember how much I enjoyed it, but I did remember how much I enjoyed the trailer for Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. I was also seriously impressed by the Wii U hardware.

This post isn't about what I liked about E3, though. It's about what I didn't like about E3. It was the greatest gaming show ever, in my opinion, but the show lacked the goodwill that I have come to expect from E3. I think the show had a lot of hype and a lot of value, but I think they forgot to do the most important thing: communicate.

The only thing that I remember from E3 were the trailers for games like Forza Horizon, Assassin's Creed IV, and The Last of Us. The lack of communication was frustrating, because I never knew what to expect from E3 in the first place. I would have preferred being surprised by the trailer for the new Bioshock, but even that would have been better than being surprised by nothing. It would have been nice to see some new ideas from the big N, instead of just the same games they've been peddling for years. It would have been nice to see some games that I have never heard of before.

Forza Horizon and Assassin's Creed IV were the most disappointing surprises. Forza Horizon is a great racing game, but I was expecting a new Forza Horizon game. Instead, I got a new Forza Horizon demo. Assassin's Creed IV is a good game, but I was expecting an Assassin's Creed game. The change was confusing, and I was left wondering what I was supposed to do.

The last thing I remember from E3 was the announcement for a new Star Wars game. I wanted to see Star Wars games, but I didn't really care much for the trailers. I was disappointed","Gaming conferences can be fun for everyone because they are interactive and immersive experiences that go on for days.

Dear Annie:

It's good to see that your garden is suffering from the cold, though it sounds like you are making the best of things! I am growing some ""hardy"" medicinal plants, as are many of my neighbors, but I have noticed that it is getting harder to find them.

I'm growing some of the same plants you are because I am determined to have a full, healthy garden this year, and I want my plants to be able to withstand the winter weather. Here are some of the plants I am growing that I am sure will be useful in treating your health problems.

• Catnip (Nepeta cataria) This is a perennial that produces a flowering spike-like shape that is covered with tiny purple flowers. The plant is used in tea for colds, coughs, and fever.

• Elder (Sambucus nigra) This is a shrubby plant that produces an attractive flower with three white petals that come out in the fall. The elder plant is also used in tea for coughs or colds.

• Ginger (Zingiber officinale) This plant produces a long stalk that looks like ginger root. Ginger is steam distilled to make a tea for digestive problems or to soothe a sore throat.

• Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea) These two wonderful plants are native to the eastern United States. The plant produces a beautiful pink flower that is used in tea to help reduce colds and coughs.

• Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) This is a plant that grows in the eastern United States and produces a beautiful yellow flower that is used in tea to help treat colds.

• Horehound (Marrubium vulgare) This is a lovely plant that is native to Europe and produces a lovely yellow flower that is used for tea to help loosen mucus in the throat.

• Motherwort (Leonurus cardiaca) This is a plant that grows in moist soil and produces a lovely yellow flower that is used in tea to help heartburn and as a diuretic.

• Osha (Ligustrum lucidum) This plant produces a beautiful yellow flower that is used in tea to help with colds and coughs.

Give me a summary of Dataphor based on this text,".

A:

Dataphora as you have understood, is a sequence of word2vec vectors.  It is useful for finding similar words in a sentence.  To find out the similarity of a word to a word2vec vector, you can use cosine similarity.
Using cosine similarity for text to text, you can find the similarity of a word to itself, so it is not a good measure for similarity in your context, but the word2vec model is built on the assumption that words that are similar to each other are also semantically similar.

Q:

Is it possible to create a mongodb query using an array of values?

I have the following collection:
{
    ""_id"" : ""5f0ad001e7387701b9b4d1e4"",
    ""_class"" : ""com.mongodb.BasicDBObject"",
    ""__v"" : 0,
    ""name"" : ""apples"",
    ""quantity"" : 2,
    ""__v"" : 0
}

I would like to query the collection using a query like this:
db.collection.find({""name"": [""apples"", ""apples"", ""apples""]})

but this doesn't work. Is there a way to do this using a query?
This is the error I get when I attempt to execute this query:
> db.collection.find({""name"": [""apples"", ""apples"", ""apples""]})
>
> Error: error: {
>     ""$err"" : ""not authorized on apples.$cmd"",
>     ""code"" : 13,
>     ""errmsg"" : ""not authorized on apples.$cmd""
> }
>

A:

You can do it by using mongodb aggregation query.
db.collection.aggregate({
   $match: {name: 'apples'}});

or you can use below query for find:
db.collection.find({$or: [{name: 'apples'}, {name: 'apples'}, {name: 'apples'}]});

Give me a bulleted list of the current members of Pearl Jam.,", I’ll be happy to read it.

@JohnD Yeah, I’d be interested in reading your list. I’m not much of a music fan, but I’m interested in hearing what someone else thinks about the music.

I find a lot of people talk a lot about who they like and don’t like. It’s like when you’re in high school and you want to impress someone, you say “I like this band, they’re awesome!” and try to convince the other person that you’re awesome too. When in reality you just like them because they’re popular.

I’m a big fan of Pearl Jam. Not extremely into the other bands, but the music is good.

Lately I’ve been listening to the Pearl Jam record Ten. I like it a lot, but I did find the first track “Daughter” to be a little boring.

@DaveyB I’ve never really listened to the other bands you mentioned (except maybe Soundgarden and Nirvana), I tend to stick to the “core” bands, but I like what you said about what people say about bands they like and not like. I use to do that a lot.

About to listen to the new album, the first track is “Daughter”, and its really good.

@DaveyB I also find that when people say they like a band, it’s usually because of how popular the band is, usually because of the commercial success (or lack thereof) of that band. I’m not saying that’s wrong, but I think it’s pretty hypocritical.

I’ve liked a lot of different music, but Pearl Jam is one of the few bands I’ve found that consistently gets me going. It’s not just good music, but good music that I can connect with. There are other bands that occasionally get me going, but not with near the frequency that Pearl Jam has.

I love Pearl Jam, but I’m not sure if they’re my favorite band. They’ve definitely been my favorite band for many years. A couple of my friends have been raving about them for years now, and I’ve heard them a couple of times, but I don’t listen to much else. I’m going to listen to Ten tonight and see if I like it.

Extensive intracerebral and intraventricular calcifications in a patient with pseudohypoparathyroidism.
We describe a patient with pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) who developed extensive intracerebral and intraventricular calcifications. The calcifications were not related to hypercalcemia. Serum calcium was slightly elevated, but the serum phosphorus was normal. The intracerebral calcifications were found in both the frontal lobes and in the cervical spinal cord, and the intraventricular calcifications were localized in both the lateral ventricles. These calcifications developed in the absence of vitamin D deficiency. The patient's serum PTH level was inappropriately low. The patient was treated with a low-dose calcium plus vitamin D3 preparation and with an active vitamin D3 preparation, but the calcifications did not regress. Although the calcifications were initially thought to be non-neoplastic, the patient subsequently developed progressive dementia. The cause of the dementia was uncertain but her mental status improved with hemodialysis, and she died from a cardiac arrest. This case suggests that the intracerebral calcifications and the intraventricular calcifications were not related to a high level of serum calcium, but that they may have been caused by a low-level of PTH.We are engaged in offering a wide assortment of Sash Window Stays.

What are the different types of snowboarding styles?,"ⓘ

What's new?

Here's a look at the snowboarding styles that have been popularized by the stars over the years. These are the snowboarding styles that have been the most memorable for the athletes competing at the Olympics and the World Cups. A good example of this is the style of snowboarding that is most popular in the United States and Japan. A good snowboarder will adapt the style to excelling in the sport.

Do all dog breeds have long tails?,"

No, not all dog breeds have long tails. In fact, the most common breed of dog in the world has a short tail. The British bulldog is often used as an example of a dog breed with a short tail, but this is an incorrect assumption. The British bulldog is actually a British Cattle Dog. This is a relatively new breed created in the late 1800s by breeding a standard Bull dog with a Cattle Dog.

How does a dog’s tail grow?

The tail of a dog is made up of three bones (called vertebrae) and they are attached to the spine. The first bone, which is also the largest, is the caudal vertebrae, which is attached to the last vertebra of the tail. The second bone is called the ischial, which is attached to the first caudal vertebra. The third bone is called the sacral, which is attached to the second caudal vertebra. The tail grows slowly. The tail will grow to half it’s full length in the first year.

How to trim a dog’s tail

The tail of a dog should be trimmed only if necessary. For example, if the dog is pulling on the tail, then the tail should be trimmed to shorten the tail. If the tail is too long, you should trim the tail to the length of the dog’s body. If the tail is too short, it will cause the dog pain and can cause the tail to grow back unevenly. If you are unsure how to trim a dog’s tail, then ask your veterinarian.

Some dogs have a long tail, others do not. Some dogs have very long tails, such as the Dalmatian, while others, such as the English Mastiff, have very short tails. No dog breed has a very long tail, so this is not a good example for a dog with a long tail. The long tail of the Dalmatian is actually a vestige of the dog’s ancestors.

Dogs with long tails are not necessarily dangerous. In fact, these dogs are often very sweet and loving. However, they do have a few problems. If the dog’s tail is too long, it can cause the dog pain, and if it is too short, the dog may be unable to support itself.

What type of jacket do grizzlies usually wear?," Bears

Answers

Answers

Wear your thickest jacket. Grizzlies are very big and strong. They can easily lift a person and drag them away. They will also bite through anything. They are not afraid of people, but will run from them if they have to.Personally, I think it's a poor idea. It's a one-time deal, and the first time you use it won't be special enough to make you want to buy it again.

Also, I don't know that you can use it five times in a year. Maybe you have to use it in non-consecutive years to get the full 100% discount.

I was thinking the same thing. You can only get a free one-time use for the faint of heart.

I've never used it, but my husband has and he said it was AWESOME. He's a big guy, and he was able to lift me over his head and into the air like a rag doll. We both laughed so hard.

I hate to say it, but I think it's a scam. I don't think it's supposed to lift people like that. It's supposed to be used as a grounding device, but I think it's being used to lift people up.

Which is a species of fish? Trout or Bear,"?

A:

The answer is

 Fishes 

because

 Every fish has two heads each with a mouth in the middle and some have eyes on the sides.

 Consider the following 4-dimensional fish: 

It's a cold, snowy Saturday afternoon in January, and I'm spending the afternoon at the YMCA, the only gym in downtown Toronto. A woman in her 30s is sitting on a bench, reading a book. The hour-long workout is in full swing, and she's on the treadmill, listening to music and sweating.

She's not alone. I'm the youngest person in the room, and the only guy. The women are older and wear yoga pants. The men are middle-aged and wear sweats, with flannels on their heads.

I've been coming here for years, and although I've been a member for a week, I still feel awkward and out of place. I'm doing a workout at a gym, which is like, so not normal. I'm a guy in the gym with some flannels on my head, looking around at all these people who look like they just stepped off the pages of Vogue, and everyone is at a different level of fitness.

Is this guy a member? I ask a guy in a tracksuit, who is abs deep in a squat.

""I'm not a member,"" he says. ""I just come here to use the pool.""

I'm not sure why I'm at the YMCA, but I'm here. I'm paying $20 a month and getting a membership to use the gym and the pool, so I'm going to use it. I'm doing a workout, and I'm going to get sweaty and feel better about myself. I'm going to do yoga. I'm going to sweat.

I'm in a pretty good mood – I haven't been able to play guitar in a while, and I'm getting back into it.

But I feel a little off. I'm not sure why I'm at the YMCA, but I'm here. I'm paying $20 a month and getting a membership to use the gym and the pool, so I'm going to use it. I'm doing a workout, and I'm going to get sweaty and feel better about myself. I'm going to do yoga. I'm going to sweat.

How do I get better at bouldering?,"heitpro.com

I watched my friend climb up to the top of some boulder problems and it seemed so easy and so natural to him. I was wondering how I could get better at bouldering?

A:

I would suggest that you watch other climbers climbing.
Watch their hands.
Watch their feet.
Watch their movements.
Watch their climbs.
Watch their falls.

You can learn more about climbing by watching others than reading about it.

A:

I would suggest to climb with a climbing instructor. I have been climbing for a few years and I found that there is always something new to learn and I have to be reminded about things I have learned before. Little by little I am getting better and more confident.

A:

The best way to improve at bouldering is to get on lots of different boulders and go climbing on them.  I climb boulders almost every day.  I started when I was 11 years old and now I am nearly 30.  The more boulders that you climb the better you will get at bouldering.

Regarding the prices: I think all of the tools listed here are reasonable
prices for what they offer. The issue I have with this list is that it seems
to be the equivalent of a listing of the pros and cons of each tool. That's
fine, but it's not very useful to the average developer unfamiliar with any
of the tools.

Why Santorini is Famous,"enome.com

The Greek islands are best known for their gorgeous sunsets, beautiful beaches and relaxed attitude towards visitors. But Santorini is famous for another reason, and that is the volcanic eruption of Thera which happened around 3,600 BC. The blast was so powerful that it sent a tsunami across the Mediterranean destroying parts of Greece and Italy and leaving the island a pancake of rock, off the coast of Turkey.

The eruption is believed to have been caused by a large explosive event which flooded the caldera of the volcano with lava, ground up rocks and ash. Over the next few thousand years, volcanic activity within the caldera grew and grew until it became one of the most famous tourist spots in the world.

The eruption left a massive caldera and a number of smaller craters within the rim of the caldera.

The caldera is around 158km across and is composed mainly of obsidian which has cooled to a glassy consistency. The obsidian is made of shattered lava rocks and volcanic ash. A number of smaller craters then formed within the caldera, and the land above the caldera floor is now covered with lava flows and the remains of the smaller craters.

The most famous of the smaller craters is Akrotiri, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Akrotiri crater was formed by a landslide which created a huge dome within the rim of the caldera. The dome then collapsed and collapsed on top of the caldera floor creating a large depression. The caldera floor is now filled with lava flows and ash, and the site of Akrotiri is now a large village located at the bottom of the caldera.

Eruption of Thera

The eruption of Thera is thought to have been caused by a combination of forces which included the eruption of the volcano in the Phrygian-Cappadocian volcanic zone in Turkey, an increase in tectonic plate movement caused by the collision of the African plate with the Eurasian plate and the movement of the Mediterranean Sea floor.

The eruption of Thera left a number of smaller craters within the rim of the caldera

The eruption of Thera was a large and catastrophic event. It is thought that the eruption of Thera had a major impact on the climate of the Mediterranean region, and a number of studies have tried to understand how this impact had such",Because it has nice beaches and mountain resorts.

While everyone does not need higher eduction in order to be successful, it does offer many ways for people to explore new interests, develop a mastery of skills, and even learn more about themselves. Higher education offers academic, as well as personal benefits. For example, attending a college or university offers the chance for people to receive mentorship from distinguished professors, meet new people from diverse backgrounds, and share their own ideas with others.

Reddit doesn't suck. I'm not a fan of the video-centric reddit, but the general reddit is okay. I like to read the subreddits and see what people are talking about. I've also been known to read the r/Worldnews subreddit, which is my personal favorite. If you are interested in seeing what people are talking about around the world, I recommend the r/news subreddit.

If you are looking for a good place to hang out with some people, I recommend Reddit's /r/gaming subreddit. It's a good place to go to find some new people to game with.

I think Reddit's fun because it's a community of people who are passionate about the things that they are passionate about. Many of the subreddits are pretty niche, so it's not going to be as much fun the first time you log in. There is a lot of space to explore, so you can find a subreddit that is going to be fun for you.

I think Reddit can be a lot of fun, but I recommend taking it slow. The first thing you need to do is decide whether you want to play games with people or not. If you decide that you do, then you need to find some people that are interested in playing.

I'm sure someone will say ""just ask for a friend."" That's not a good answer. You have to find someone that you like and talk to them, because everyone is different.

"Extract all the geographical places from the following passage: On Thursday we flew to Sandakan in Sabah. The Qatar flight had several newspapers available for passengers to read. On the front page of all of them were stories about Saddam Hussein and the invasion of Iraq.  When we arrived in Borneo, we saw a two-page spread in a newspaper that dove into the history of Kurdistan. The very next article celebrated the liberation of Baghdad, the city juxtaposed against a backdrop of New York City in the United States.",". We saw the same thing in the next newspaper. The articles were so ubiquitous on the cities, that it was almost as if Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi army had never invaded. The pretense of a Kurdistan was a sham, and we were reminded of the broader context in the Middle East where the resistance to the occupation of Iraq was the first step in the liberation of Palestine.Advertisement

The next day, we were able to read the full story, but it was not until four days later, on our flight back to Kuwait, that we were able to absorb the entire experience. We would soon be able to read the full story on the Internet, but it would not be until the next year that we would be able to see the full story. This is the ultimate power of the Internet. The media spreads quickly and widely, but the hard work of spreading the word takes longer. We noticed two things on the plane. The first was that many of our friends who were traveling back to the states came from Turkey and Lebanon. They had heard about it on the radio from the US. The second was that almost everyone in the airplane had heard about it. The media had already spread the word. This made us realize that the media is not the only source of information. We could not access the story in the media, but we could see it in the person, and in the person, in the person. It was the ultimate empowerment.

The prognostic value of Ki-67 in breast cancer with sentinel node metastases.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the proliferation marker Ki-67 in patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases. The study included 225 patients with breast cancer and SLN involvement. The patients were divided into three groups: patients with no evidence of disease (NED), patients with micrometastases (M1) and patients with macrometastases (M2). The expression of Ki-67 and the number of SLN involved were correlated with the nodal status, tumor stage and axillary lymph node negative rate (LNR). The expression of Ki-67 in patients with M1 (7.8%) was significantly lower than in patients with M2 (41.7%) and NED (39.4%). The number of SLN involved was significantly higher in patients with M1 (42.7%) than in patients with M2 (33.3%) and NED (18.2%). The LNR was significantly lower in patients with M1 (0.86) than in patients with M2 (1.33) and NED (1.59). The expression of Ki-67 in patients with M2 (7.8%) was significantly higher than in patients with M1 (1.9%) (p < 0.001).

You know that saying “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks”? Well, I’m not sure it’s true, but it’s certainly true that you can keep an old dog in better shape by forcing it to do new things.

Wildcat B is not a 4000 footer either. It does have 4000 feet of elevation, but it is more than 4000 feet away from the other 4000 footers.
Wildcat C is a 4000 footer, even though it is only 2000 feet away from Wildcat A. It is a 4000 footer because it has 4000 feet of elevation.
Wildcat D is a 4000 footer, even though it is only 1800 feet away from Wildcat C. It is a 4000 footer because it has 4000 feet of elevation.

SALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Jazz have extended their practice session before facing the Washington Wizards on Tuesday.

The practice was supposed to be removed from the schedule because the Jazz are expected to arrive in Washington with guards Trey Burke and Rodney Hood. Instead, the practice was pushed up because the Jazz have been practicing on the court at the University of Utah and the practice facility is closed for the holiday weekend.

The Wizards are coming off a big win in Cleveland with a 107-97 win over the Cavaliers on Monday. Washington was playing its second game in three days after a three-day break.

The Jazz have not been able to practice since Friday. The Wizards are scheduled to have a light practice on Tuesday before heading to Cleveland on Wednesday.

Every NBA player has been tested for COVID-19. So far, no Jazz players have tested positive.

The NBA suspended the season on March 11. But the league and players union agreed that the season would not resume until 17 days after the five-week hiatus. So games started in mid-March and continue to this point.

Why do people like to drink tea?,"a tea

shaira tea

shaira (also known as som, shaira bhuka and shaira-bhuja), is a mildly carbonated drink made from fresh or partially fermented tea leaves, water and sugar. It is typically consumed in the Indian subcontinent.

Contents

Tea contains polyphenols that are thought to aid in digestion. Shaira tea is an example of the use of these polyphenols in the body. The most common form of shaira is made with fresh or partially fermented tea leaves. The brown sugar is added to give the water a brown colour and to add a sweet taste. The tea is then infused with carbonated water to give it a foam and to carbonate the tea.

The most commonly used tea in these instances is Darjeeling tea, which has a long history of use in India. However, other teas can be used. Because the tea has been partially fermented, it has a less astringent taste and is less bitter than unfermented tea.

The drink is popular in India, Nepal and Pakistan and is also used in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. It is typically consumed with a piece of bread, a jaggery stick or a lime. The drink is also popular in Pakistan, where shaira is considered a national drink.

It is also used in Ceylon as an accompaniment to a meal. It is also used in the United Kingdom as a ""tipple"" or in other parts of the Commonwealth as a ""bit of a drink"". In the Arab world it is used in Kuwait and parts of the Persian Gulf. In Russia shaira is served in the form of a shot.

In the Indian sub-continent, shaira is served in the form of a shot. The shot is typically served over ice and is sold by vendors in the streets. The vendor will pour the shot into a glass and charge a small fee.

This allows softwares to be optimized for performance against ARM chipset as opposed to an 86 hardware approach to optimize. It would also be interesting to mention that ARM uses higher memory and less registers compared to x86.,0.625786,0.98259,22.343396,0.984241,0.612168,5.109636,-8.124018669128418

"Identify which animal species is alive or extinct: Xenacanthus, Seal",", Plesiosaurs, Ichthyosaurs, Pterosaurs and the like.

The model of the Earth is the perfect sphere, I used the average radius of the Earth and the same volume as the Earth to calculate the surface area.

The planet is a sphere of radius r, the distance between the center of the Earth and the surface of the planet is d. In this case the volume of the planet is 4/3 pi r³.

The surface area of the planet is found from the volume and surface area of a sphere: 4/3 pi r³ x 4/3 pi r³ = 4/3 π r³ 4/3 π r³ = 4/3 pi r² = 4/3 r². The surface area of the planet is r².

The volume of the planet is 4/3 pi r³ = 4/3 pi (3/r)³ = 4/3 r³.

The surface area of the planet is 4/3 pi r² = 4/3 r².

The volume of the Earth is the volume of the sphere with a radius of the radius of the Earth. The volume of the Earth is 4/3 pi r³ = 4/3 r³.

The surface area of the Earth is 4/3 pi r² = 4/3 r². The surface area of the Earth is 4/3 π r³.

The volume of the Earth is the volume of the sphere with a radius of the radius of the Earth. The volume of the Earth is 4/3 pi r³ = 4/3 r³.

List different ways in which Nuclear power can be obtained based on the passage.," or the nuclear bomb.

Nuclear Power

A nuclear power station is a facility where nuclear reactions are used to generate heat or electricity. The heat from the nuclear reactions is used to generate steam which is in turn used to drive turbines to generate electricity or fluid. The type of reaction that occurs in a nuclear reactor has a large impact on the energy output of the plant and can be classified as either thermal or fissile.

Nuclear Reactor

Nuclear reactors are the core of a nuclear power plant. They produce heat by self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions. The fast neutrons produced by these reactions are absorbed by the uranium or thorium nuclei, producing the release of energy. The neutrons and (in the case of uranium) alpha particles are absorbed by the nuclei of the fuel, leaving behind new stable isotopes of the original elements. The fission reaction produces energy as well as radioactive by-products ( fission products) which must be guarded and disposed of safely. The main components of a nuclear reactor are the reactor core, reactor vessel, and control rod system.

Nuclear Fission

Nuclear fission is the process by which a large nucleus of an atom is split into two new smaller nuclei. The nuclei are not directly observable but are created in the process and can be observed by their ability to emit neutrons.

MLB and its 30 teams, plus the playing fields of both leagues, are in the Atlanta metro area. The area is considered ""suburban"" because it is outside of the city of Atlanta and it contains a large residential population. Atlanta is the second largest city in the United States.

Atlanta has seven teams in the National League and six teams in the American League. The Atlanta Braves are responsible for the region's nickname.

The Atlanta Braves play in Turner Field, located on the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority's Chastain Park on the Atlanta-Fulton County line. The stadium opened in 1997 and is home to the Atlanta Braves.

The stadium is named for former Braves player and manager Phil ""Piney"" Farrell. The stadium is also the home of the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL), and the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA. It is the only venue to hold both the NBA and NFL championships in the same year.

MLB Advanced Media (MLBAM), the league's Internet arm, operates a number of websites for the teams in the Atlanta area. The websites include www.atlantafalcons.mlb.com for the Atlanta Falcons, and www.atlantabraves.mlb.com for the Atlanta Braves.

Atlanta is also the home of the Turner Field Baseball complex, owned and operated by the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority. The complex includes the Atlanta Braves' minor league baseball team, the Gwinnett Braves, and the Turner Field ballpark.

How many teams are in the National League and American League?

The National League has 30 teams, while the American League has 26 teams. The Seattle Mariners and the Arizona Diamondbacks of the American League joined the league in 1989 and 1990, respectively.

The Cleveland Indians moved their team to the American League in 1953, and the team was renamed the Cleveland Indians. The Cleveland Indians are the longest-tenured team in the National League. The Cleveland Indians are the only team to have played in all three decades between the late 1800s to the present.

Why mobile is bad for human,"ion.

~~~
Chris_Newton
The article is not about the general case, but specifically about the case of
the US military. Mobile phones are a clear advantage for them, especially
because they are effectively always available to them, even when they are
flying in an aircraft.

The idea that mobile phones are somehow intrinsically bad for soldiers is
ridiculous.

~~~
mikeash
I don't think that's the point, though. The point is that frequently the
military is deliberately choosing to do things that are _bad for soldiers_.

I'm not saying that the military shouldn't have mobile phones; what I'm saying
is that the military shouldn't be using them to punish soldiers and their
families for being poor and working class.

~~~
Chris_Newton
I’m not sure I understand. Do you disagree that a military that wants to
punish soldiers and their families for poor living standards will make use of
mobile phones to do so?

~~~
mikeash
The point isn't that they should be using it. The point is that they're
_choosing_ to use it.

If you have a few soldiers who are afraid to talk about their families, and
you decide to cut off their phones, so they can't talk to their families, that
isn't exactly a decision that is going to make sense to anyone involved.

nsns
Of course, the military has a right to do whatever it wants, but I think it
might be worth asking whether there's actually any reason that they need to
use their weapons.

The civilian control of the military has been a myth for some time now (albeit
one that is very strongly supported by the military).

I think the best way to deal with this problem is to educate the general
public, and the media in particular, that the US military is staffed,
appointed, and funded by the government, and that it is not a separate
organisation. It is all part of the US government, which is a huge political
institution that has its own needs, interests, and priorities.

I think this will help a lot to get rid of the general perception that the
military is something that is beyond civilian control.

What is the history of Tax Day in the United States?

Tax Day, referred to as Taxation Day, is the day the U.S. federal government collects all taxes owed to it. Tax Day differs from calendar day in that it falls on the same day of the week every year.

Tax Day is celebrated on the last day of April. In the United States, April 15 is the day that all income taxes are due and payable, as well as any federal payroll and excise taxes. Some U.S. states extend Tax Day to the next day, and some states have no designated tax day.

The date of Tax Day in the United States is determined by Congress.

Although Tax Day is typically celebrated by Americans, it is also observed on the same day in some countries, such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

Tax Day in the United States is closely tied to the tax return. Tax Day is not universally observed in all countries.

Because Tax Day is not universally observed, the date may be altered in some countries. For example, in Canada, Tax Day is celebrated on the second Monday in April. By contrast, European countries often celebrate Tax Day on the same day as April 15.

History of Tax Day

Tax Day is the day when the United States federal government collects all taxes owed to it. Tax Day is the day on which the federal government collects taxes owed to it by U.S. citizens and residents.

Tax Day was originally celebrated on April 15, 1792, by the Second Continental Congress. This date was chosen as the day of the year when the U.S. federal government would receive all taxes owed.

In 1789, the federal government was weak and had not received all of the revenue from the taxes it had levied. The Second Continental Congress established a tax levy in 1787, but the U.S. was still not able to collect all of the taxes owed at that time.

The Second Continental Congress also passed a law in 1789 to establish a date for determining the date of the federal tax levy and the date on which the U.S. federal government would collect taxes.

This law required that the U.S. federal government collect taxes on April 15 of each year. This date was chosen because it fell on a Monday, allowing the U.S. federal government to collect taxes in conjunction with the collection of federal payrolls and other federal taxes","Tax Day exists as a deadline for many United States residents to report earnings in order to pay income taxes.

The United States introduced the income tax in 1861 in order to fund the American Civil War. This was later deemed unconstitutional and repealed in 1872. This was later reenacted in 1894 as part of the Revenue Act with its constitutionality settled in the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. Tax day was initially set for March in 1913 and was eventually moved to April 15th in 1955.",0.43962,0.998273,21.832097,0.952637,0.527901,4.950106,-4.465235233306885

What are the five best places to hike in the San Francisco Bay Area and why?," - you can't go wrong with any of them

The Bay Area is full of beautiful trails - and hiking is a great way to get a taste of the area. I've had the chance to visit many trails in the Bay Area, and I've found that there are five places that I always return to and recommend to others.

1. Alamere Falls

Alamere Falls is one of the most spectacular places to hike in the Bay Area. The trail goes through a redwood forest, which is a short walk from the parking lot. The falls are a great place to take a rest and snap some photos. The trail is also beautiful and well marked. The falls are stunning; they are very tall and the water is amazing. It is very refreshing to cool off in the falls.

2. Redwood Regional Park

This is another great place to hike in the Bay Area. The park is in the Redwood National Forest, and it is about a 25 minute drive from the Golden Gate Bridge. The hike is about 2 miles in length, and it is a moderate hike. It offers a great look at the majestic redwoods. The park has a great playground for kids too.

3. Stairway to Heaven

Another great hike is the Stairway to Heaven. It is about a 15-minute drive from the Golden Gate Bridge. The hike is a moderate hike, and it takes you to the top of the hill. The trail is mostly flat, and you get some amazing views of the bay. The trail is pretty easy to follow, and it is a great place to take a break or snap some photos.

4. Stinson Beach

"Given this paragraph about cat's senses, what light level can domestic house cats see at in comparison to human sight?",".jpg

The Sight and Sound of the 'Cat in the Hat'

House cats have about half the number of cones in their eye as humans, according to a new study. Researchers found that the color vision of house cats was like our vision for the first 400 nanometers of light -- but then it fell off sharply.

Cats are often thought of as ""color blind,"" but their eyes are sensitive to a much wider range of colors than people's, according to the study in the journal Vision Research. Humans can see about 200 nanometers beyond the yellow-green end of the visible spectrum, but some species of cats, like feral cats, can see even shorter wavelengths, like the ultraviolet.

This ability to see ultraviolet light is important for hunting, because ultraviolet light can help cats spot the eyes of prey animals. But it could also be important for feline vision, according to the researchers.

""If cats are able to see ultraviolet light, they may be able to see other animals in the ultraviolet,"" said study author and neuroscientist Dr. Michael Dickinson of the University of Rochester. ""So they may be able to see things that humans can't see.""

For the study, researchers measured the cone cells in the eyes of two types of domestic cats: domestic shorthair, which is used for hunting, and domestic longhair, which is used for companionship. They also measured the cones in the eyes of eight other species of feline, including the cheetah and the lion. They found that the domestic shorthair had about half the number of cones that humans have in our eyes. The domestic longhair had about a quarter as many.

Cats were found to have about 30 percent of the cones that humans do. The other species of cats did not have enough cones for the researchers to test them, but they believe their cones are very similar to those of the house cats.

""I think it's fair to say that cat vision is pretty much similar to that of human vision,"" Dickinson said. But he said he wasn't sure how much the differences matter. ""How much do the cones really contribute to what cats do, which is largely hunting or interacting with their owners?""

The researchers also found that the cones in the eyes of domestic cats are much smaller than they are in other animals. The cones in the eyes of cheetahs are about the size of a grain of rice. The cones in the eyes of house cats are about",Domestic cats are able to see at one-sixth the light level required for human vision.,0.054799,0.790023,19.413337,0.990477,0.045697,4.258867,-4.535483360290527

Community leadership is not a natural instinct for most people. Many people believe that they are leaders, but they are actually followers. The leaders are the ones that make the decisions and the followers are the ones that carry them out.

Many people want to be leaders, but they don’t want to take the time to build a community and learn how to be a leader. They don’t want to demonstrate hard work. They want to be in charge and make all the decisions. They want to be the leader, but they are not willing to be the follower.

When you want to be a leader and you want to be a follower, you will need to build a community to support you. You can’t be a leader by yourself. You need the support of others to accomplish what you want to do.

Leadership is about taking risks. You are going to make mistakes, but you have to learn from those mistakes. Be brave about the decisions you make. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about being willing to be who you are.

The leaders that are the most successful are the ones that have the courage to make decisions. They are willing to take risks and make mistakes. They are willing to ask for help. They are willing to change their minds.

People that are leaders don’t have to be the smartest. They don’t have to be the strongest. They only need to be able to lead.

What is a typical Humpback Whale migration pattern,"?
Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) migrate in the Southern Hemisphere's mid- to high-latitudes, with the majority (~80%) of their annual travels within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). During the austral summer, adults and calves migrate primarily to the Antarctic Peninsula and subantarctic islands, where they feed on krill and other prey to fuel their long-distance travels. During the austral winter, they travel north into the tropical eastern Indian and Pacific Oceans. In some years, they move far north into the Arctic Ocean, but they are generally seen only in the Antarctic basin. The main migratory path is the so-called Antarctic humpback whale corridor (AHC), a region of relatively high productivity that extends from the Antarctic Peninsula to the Antarctic continent. The AHC is a relatively small area (~2,000 km2) compared to the size of the entire ocean basin (~16 million km2), but it contains a disproportionately large number of individual whales, a phenomenon known as the ""humpback whale concentration effect."" This effect is caused by the high average density of krill in the AHC and is due to the AHC being a region of high productivity, where krill are concentrated due to lack of competition from other prey species.

Humpback whales also migrate seasonally, and are thought to use a variety of pathways in the Southern Ocean. Some of these pathways are spatially distributed in a manner that can be explained by oceanographic features, such as eddies or meanders. Others have been named for their hypothesized use, including the ""Southern Ocean Trail"" (SOT) and the ""Great Southern Ocean Route"" (GSOR), both of which have been hypothesized to be used by humpback whales during their migration.

In general, the winter migration routes are less well known than the summer migrations, because many whales pass through the area under the cover of night. This makes it difficult to observe them in their natural environment, and many observations are made during the migration, rather than during the winter's rest.

Many questions remain about the humpback whale migration, including their migration patterns, how they use the AHC, and the reasons behind areas of high productivity in the AHC.

Where do humpback whales feed during their migration?
Although humpback whales are thought to feed on krill during their migration, it is difficult to prove","Humpback whales will typically feed in the summer months off the rich waters of Alaska, northern Canada and eastern Russia, and begin their migration to warmer waters of Hawaii or Mexico starting in mid-fall to breed.  The migration takes about 6 to 8 weeks and they begin arriving in Hawaii in late October/early November.  They will stay in warmer regions to breed and calve their babies during winter, and will start their migration back to the polar regions by late March or April.  It is estimated that up to 14,000 whales make this migration to Hawaii every winter.",0.079362,0.869554,14.463962,0.905246,0.067108,3.277046,-4.26807975769043
What is the difference between a fire fighter and a nurse?,"al

Answer

A fire fighter is a civilian who works with firefighters in a fire department. A nurse is a professional who works with doctors in a hospital.In the fabrication of dynamoelectric machines, it is conventional practice to mount a rotor on a shaft and to secure the shaft to a housing. It is also conventional to provide a seal between the shaft and the housing to prevent leakage of the rotor from the housing. One example of such a seal is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,705,377, which issued to B. L. Schmitt on Dec. 12, 1972.
The housing in prior art dynamoelectric machines typically comprises a cast metal alloy having a smooth cylindrical interior surface. The shaft extends through the housing and is secured to the rotor on one end and to the housing on the other end. The inner surface of the housing extends slightly above the outer surface of the shaft so that the shaft is spaced from the inner surface of the housing with a clearance which is on the order of magnitude of about 0.001 inch. The inner surface of the housing is typically not smooth or cylindrical, but has a plurality of ribs, slots, or the like, which serve to strengthen the material and to enhance the cooling of the housing.
The housing is secured to the shaft by a plurality of mounting plates, which are bolted to the housing. The mounting plates extend radially from the inner surface of the housing and are spaced circumferentially from each other. The mounting plates are secured to the shaft by nuts which are bolted to the mounting plates. The nuts are tightened against the inner surface of the housing to compress the mounting plates toward the inner surface of the housing. The mounting plates are thus secured to the shaft and the housing.
In order to assist in the tightening of the mounting plates against the inner surface of the housing, it is known to provide a seal between the shaft and the housing. In one known arrangement, the shaft is mounted within a bore in the housing. A first seal is spaced from the inner surface of the housing and is secured to the shaft. A second seal is spaced from the inner surface of the housing and is secured to the housing. The first seal is compressed between the housing and the shaft to form a positive seal between the shaft and the housing. The second seal is compressed between the housing and the shaft to form a positive seal between the shaft and the housing.
While the foregoing arrangement does provide a positive seal between the shaft and the housing, the seal is compressed","A fire fighter is responsible for responding to emergencies that are mostly related to fires. A typical task would be to ride in a fire truck from the fire station to a home that has caught fire and use water and other fire-fighting tools to put it out.

A typical task for a nurse would be to care for the wounds and help manage pain for a patient following surgery.",0.236468,0.999183,2.134464,0.974441,0.249016,0.918714,-4.735991477966309

For these foodies, let us consider, what is the best food. In this author's humble opinion, pizza is the best food. And here's why. First, it's universality. While hailing from Italy, or so they say, pizza is enjoyed across the globe. Second, it's very accessible, on a couple of fronts. If you want just a snack, you can have just one slice of pizza. If you need to feed a family, you can order a whole pizza pie. If you need to feed a large group - pizza can be ordered and received in large quantities. Then, there are the varieties of pizza. There are many different types of crust to suit your preferences. There are many different types of sauces, cheeses, and toppings that can put on pizza. Nearly an limitless combination of pizzas to suit all palettes. But the best reason is simply the depth of flavor in each and every bite.

How to do forecasting with small dataset?,":

A:

The simplest way to do this is to use a linear regression. You can find an introduction to linear regression in many places. The concept is that the dependent variable is the variable you want to predict, and the explanatory variable is the variable you want to use to make the prediction. For example, you could say that you want to predict the sales of a company, and you have several lines of data of sales of the company over time. Each time you have a data point for sales, you can use that to estimate the values of the dependent variable.
You can then add an intercept to the model, which is the value for the dependent variable if you start with no data. So, for example, if you start with no data for a particular company, then the dependent variable is sales. The intercept is then the value of sales for that company. This is essentially the average of the data points you have.
Once you have a model of this sort, where the dependent variable is sales and the explanatory variable is time, you can predict sales for a new time period by using the model. You can then get a forecast of sales for that time period by multiplying the predicted sales by the coefficient for time.

What are the applications of game theory in NBA basketball?,"a2019-09-04T13:35:36Z2019-09-04T13:35:36Z

Game theory is a branch of mathematics that uses mathematical models to analyze strategic interactions between two or more people.

Game theory may be the most widely studied branch of mathematics, but this doesn't mean that it is the most useful. Like engineering, it is difficult to apply game theory to real-world problems. Game theory is most used in situations where the outcome of the interaction is not certain.

Game theory can be used to analyze the strategies of players in a sport and how their approach affects the outcome of the game.

For example, the strategy of a player to run up and down the court and dribble the basketball can be analyzed by game theory. In basketball, the outcomes are not known in advance. If a player runs up and down the court and dribbles the basketball, but doesn't receive a shot, the outcome is not known until the player shoots.

Going forward, we will look at the strategies of players in basketball. We will also simulate how those strategies affect the outcome of the game.

Game theory is used to analyze how best to approach the game.

The strategies of players are analyzed using game theory.

Game theory can be used to examine how well an individual player performs in a specific situation. For example, in a basketball game, if a player is fouled, and the player makes the free throw, the player is said to have made a ""good shot."" If a player makes multiple free throws, this is called a ""good performance.""

The strategies of basketball players can be analyzed using game theory.

These are the strategies of players in basketball.

Using game theory, the strategies of two players in basketball can be examined.

In basketball, the outcome","Game theory studies the strategic interaction of rationale agents. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the ""modern NBA"", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the ""strictly dominate"" strategy as this allows the ""modern"" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy. Now nearly all NBA teams employ this strategy, so it is less effective (A Nash (Not Steve Nash!) Equilibrium).",0.300243,0.955932,25.023531,0.945177,0.308372,5.506651,-5.292210578918457

But a former deputy provost, who has been involved in the region’s politics for over a decade, said the G7 was “overly optimistic” about the effects of aid. “Aid has a huge multiplier effect, and that’s a fact that doesn’t get talked about enough,” he said. “The economics of aid is very, very important.”

The G7’s emphasis on debt relief is probably the right move, says Foster, because it will improve the countries’ economic prospects. “It would be very important for the credibility of the G7 to come out and say ‘we want debt relief, but we’re not going to solve climate change’. Debt relief is a very important element of that.”

But the G7 needs to deal with deeper problems. “The biggest issue in Africa is the political crisis. [The G7] is putting all its eggs in the aid basket. But if you don’t have things to say to the people in Africa, it’s not going to have the impact [the G7] think it will.”

The G7 should also be helping African countries to diversify their economies. “You need to get away from the reliance on aid,” says Foster. “If you look at China, for example, their economy has actually grown much more rapidly than the aid coming in. If you look at India, they’ve grown their economy at twice the rate as aid.

Foster thinks the G7’s focus on debt relief could be counterproductive. “If you can’t give debt relief, then [you need to] start giving them the money to develop the economy so they can generate income, so they can get their own development going.”

In fact, Foster thinks the biggest threat to the African continent comes from climate change, rather than corruption, which he says is still a problem in Africa. “If you look at the [climate] models, they’ve shown that the biggest impact on Africa will be the increase in sea level. The impact on people is going to be very much better for climate change than the impact from a corrupt regime.

“Africa is very rich, and it’s very poor. This is not an unsolvable problem. But if you look at it from the perspective of an African, it’s too early to say it’s unsolvable.”

The G7 is a fairly significant group of countries, and","Africa is the least wealthy continent per capita due to a variety of factors including: geography, climate, tribalism, colonialism, the Cold War, neocolonialism, lack of democracy, and corruption.",0.065063,0.99888,7.12624,0.938755,0.049528,1.835693,-4.554225444793701

Transcript

Cody: Hey everybody, welcome back to the Talking Business. My name is Cody Wallace and I’m your host.

Today, we’re talking about identity crisis. You know, a lot of times, I’ll do some networking events and you’re talking with somebody and before you know it, you’ve met them a lot. You’re drinking, you’re networking; you’re there and then you look at your watch and you’re like, “Oh man, I have to figure out what I’m doing next. I’ve got to get out of here.” Sometimes you have a lot of fun, sometimes you have a lot of business. But at the end of the day, you have to figure out what you’re doing and who you’re doing it for, right?

And sometimes, it gets confusing. You know, we’ve heard the term “persona” a lot. And in some ways, I think there’s a lot of misinterpretation around what this is.

So if you’ve ever been to a networking event, you know you’re wearing a suit. You’re wearing a tie. You’re wearing a nice shirt. You’re looking at your watch and you’re like, “Oh, I better get going. I’ve got to get out of here.” But the problem is, I’m guessing a lot of the people at that networking event, they’re wearing a suit and a tie. They’re wearing a nice shirt. They’re looking at their watch and they’re like “I better get going. I’ve got to get out of here.”

But if you asked them, “Hey, who are you? Why are you wearing this?” they’d probably tell you, “I’m a professional. I run a retail store. I’m a bank teller. I’","A persona is a fictional character that embodies the characteristics and traits of a particular group.

What is Credit scoring?," credit score is the three-digit number that reflects your creditworthiness. It looks at your credit history, or credit report, to determine how likely you are to pay your bills. Higher numbers are considered to be better, and a low number is considered to be worse. According to the Fair Isaac Corporation, the most recognized credit scoring model, a credit score of 800 is considered to be the best score. The lower the score, the higher the risk that you’ll pay bills late or miss payments entirely.

What is a credit report?The most commonly used credit report is the Experian Credit Report. This report is based on information in your credit file. It is what lenders use to decide whether or not to approve you for a loan. This report includes your personal information, your credit history, and your credit score.

Credit scores range from 300 to 850. The higher your score is, the better your chances are to get a loan. If you have a credit score of 700 or above, you will have very good credit. However, if you have a score lower than 700, you may not have as many loan options.

How does a credit score affect your credit report?Your credit report represents a record of your credit history. Lenders look at how you have used credit in the past, and your credit history is used to calculate your credit score. Your credit score is used to determine your interest rates and your credit limits on loans.

Your credit score is based on how you have handled your credit in the past. If you’re consistently late paying your credit card bills, your credit score will decrease, and you may be denied a loan. You may also be charged more money, or have your interest rates doubled, if you have a low credit score. A low credit score can also make it difficult to get insurance, and may make it difficult to rent an apartment.

How is a credit score calculated?The formula for calculating credit scores is different for each of the three major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion). These credit bureaus have different types of information. The credit bureaus may use information in your credit file or credit report. Data from the other two credit bureaus may also be used.

Data from one credit bureau may be used to calculate the score for another credit bureau. For example, if one of your credit card accounts is with a credit card company, the credit card company may send the credit bureau data on your account. This",This is a way of working out the risk of not being repaid if money is lent. Points are awarded for the answers given by the potential borrower to a series of questions.

"Netflix views streaming video as a ""sustaining"" technology that extends its core mail DVD business. Do you agree with this, or do you think streaming video is a ""disruptive"" technology for Netflix that does not align with its core business and requires a different strategy?"," swiss

As a Canadian I think the best way to comment on this is to say that we do not have Netflix on our cable subscription. We do have a Netflix streaming service that is similar to the one you are referring to. The basic premise is that you pay a few dollars per month and can watch as much streaming video as you want. There is a fee to access the most recent content and you also have to be connected to the internet to watch it. It is not exactly the same service that you are referring to but it is close enough that it does not really matter.

I think it is important to note that subscribers pay for Netflix and the streaming service is a secondary aspect of the service. The streaming service is included as a part of the subscription. It is not a separate service and is not billed as such. The streaming service is more of a value add to the customer.

I think I will take this opportunity to congratulate you for your excellent work on this blog. I really enjoy reading your posts.

@cdw I didn't know that Netflix had their own streaming service. Sounds like a good alternative to my mom who is a cable subscriber.

@shredder I'm so glad to hear that you like my blog. Thank you. I hope you'll continue to enjoy the content I post.

@cdw That's great to hear! I think you're right that Netflix streaming is a value add to the customer. I don't think of it as a ""subscription"" service.

@shredder I think Netflix streaming is a ""subscription"" service. It's part of the Netflix subscription. I was confusing the streaming service with the DVD service. Sorry about that.

@cdw I think Netflix streaming is a ""value add"" to the customer, but it's not the same as the streaming video that I was referring to in my post. The ""subscription"" service is a commodity that's sold off-the-shelf, and the streaming service is a subscription add-on that is sold to people who have already purchased a Netflix subscription.

@cdw That's great to hear!","Netflix did a strategic renewal by cannibalizing its own cash cow business of mail-in-DVD services. This was the right move as internet speeds were increasing and moving towards broadband. Netflix was even considering launching a TV box if internet speeds remained constant. I agree that streaming video is a disruptive technology for Netflix, requiring a different strategy. Adopting a disruptive technology, Netflix forced Blockbuster to offer the mail-in-DVD service. By the time Blockbuster offered the mail-in-DVD service, Netflix had already begun experimenting with streaming videos and had started offering the streaming video platform. Netflix made Blockbuster dance to its tunes. Netflix, currently valued at $150 billion, changed its business model twice by cannibalizing its core services, shifting from mail-in- DVD service to subscription service to streaming video subscription service.

Give me a short bulleted list of the key points about the parallel universes in this passage.,"

I find myself unable to answer this question, since I do not know the book or the author.

A:

""Parallel universes"" are a staple of SF, and the location of the definition quoted above is in fact from the famous short story ""The Star-Trek Device"" by Theodore Sturgeon.
As you note, this story is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where humanity has become a space-faring civilization, and several stories have been written about the possible futures of that society.  One of those is ""The Star-Trek Device"", in which the protagonist travels to a parallel universe by stepping through a device that produces a wormhole.  That story is often considered the classic example of the genre, and you can read it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Trek_Device - the first few lines of this page are a good place to start for an introduction to the genre.

In cricket, a player must bat to score runs. The number of runs a batsman can score depends on the number of runs scored by the other team. If the batsman scores more than the number of runs scored by the other team, he is said to have scored a ""run"". A ""run"" is said to be scored when the batsman hits the ball with a bat, or the ball is hit into the field.

What is relational database,"?

A:

I think you may be confused by the term ""relational database"" which is used to refer to a particular database architecture - not the way the data are stored.
The relational model is a model of data and the database.  It is a model that has been around for a long time (since the early 1970's), and is used in a wide variety of applications.  What is different about the relational model is the way data are stored.  It is a common misconception to think that the relational model is a particular set of data storage techniques, but in fact this is not the case.  
In particular, the term ""relational database"" is often used to refer to a particular model of storage.  The database that is referred to by this term is a database that is based on a model of relations.  In general terms, a relation is a set of tuples.  A tuple is a set of items that are related to each other.  One common way to represent data in a relational database is to have each record in the database be made up of a set of tuples.  In this way, each record in the database can be thought of as a set of tuples - each tuple is a member of the record.
In general terms, a relation is any set of tuples that satisfies certain properties.  Common properties of relations include:

Each tuple is a member of some relation
Some ""given set"" of tuples is a member of some relation

The relational model is used to model the way data are stored by adopting a model of relations.  All the data are stored in the database in the format of a set of tuples that is a member of some relation.  This model of storage is based on a model of relations - not on a model of data.

A:

A relational database stores data in relation to each other, like tables in a database.
A relational database is a database that stores data in relation to each other.
A relational database is a database that stores data in relation to each other.

The computer science term for the rest of your question is ""relational database system.""  And the computer science term for the term you are asking about is ""relational database.""  The terms are used interchangeably.  (See the Wikipedia article on database systems.)

What is YARN?,"/?

YARN is a distributed resource scheduler, which allows you to run applications on multiple machines simultaneously. YARN works on top of the MapReduce framework and allows you to run an application across multiple machines. YARN was originally developed by Yahoo! for their MapReduce framework.

How do I install YARN?

To install YARN, you will need to install several dependencies first. You can download and install all of the dependencies with the following command:

$ sudo yum install -y java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can install YARN with the following command:

$ sudo yum install hadoop

Once YARN is installed, you will need to set a configuration file to point to your cluster.

$ hadoop-env

This will output the configuration file that you will need to modify.

$ cat /etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml

This will output the configuration file that you will need to modify.

What is the difference between Hadoop and YARN?

While Hadoop is the framework that is used to run a MapReduce job, YARN is the framework that is used to run a MapReduce job on multiple machines.

It is important to note that Hadoop and YARN are not related to Hadoop, the programming language.

What is the difference between YARN and MapReduce?

YARN is a framework that allows multiple MapReduce tasks to run simultaneously on multiple machines.

What is the difference between YARN and Hadoop?

Hadoop and YARN are different frameworks in that Hadoop is the programming language while YARN is the framework that is used to run a MapReduce job on multiple machines.

How do I start a MapReduce job?

To start a MapReduce job, you will need to run the command hadoop-mapred-daemon. This command will start a MapReduce daemon on a given machine to process your MapReduce job.

How do I stop a MapReduce job?

To stop a MapReduce job, you will need to run the command hadoop-mapred-daemon. This command will stop a MapReduce daemon on a given machine to process your MapReduce job.

The first of the year brought a number of exciting news for the QAA, with the launch of the QAA Printed Books in the Dictionary Award, the launch of a new website, and the publication of the Research Guide – a guide to the QAA archives.

The QAA Printed Books in the Dictionary Award is a new competition run in conjunction with the Dictionary Society of North America (DSNA). The competition aims to promote the use of print dictionaries in undergraduate classrooms and to encourage student participation in the dictionary-making process. The competition is open to colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.

Entries must be in the English language and meet the following requirements:

Entries must be in a form that will allow them to easily be reproduced as a print dictionary. Entries should be submitted as a PDF file.

Entries must include a short synopsis, a list of keywords and definitions, and a brief explanation of the way in which the entry is intended to be used.

Entries must be accompanied by a synopsis of the author’s research and the methodology employed. The synopsis should be no more than one page in length.

Entries must include a page with a brief description of the author’s research and the methodology employed, and a page with appropriate citations.

Entries should not be submitted as a single PDF file. Entries should be submitted as separate PDF files: one for the entry itself, one for the synopsis, and one for the bibliography and citation. Entries may be submitted as separate PDF files, but they should be submitted as a single PDF file if possible.

For example, the public transportation network in Switzerland spans a wide network that comprises of trains, trams, busses, and ferries, runs timely on a schedule to the minute, and is used as a primary mode of transportation for many residents. In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car. Public transportation ridership often depends on reliability, which in turn often determines the availability of investments in the required infrastructure. This creates an unfortunate cycle making it very difficult for public transportation to become more reliable without external investments where the system is funding itself.",0.083314,0.929931,4.913419,0.204531,0.088305,1.2439,-4.732950687408447

The survey is the latest in a series of studies by TNS US regarding the relationship between consumers and fashion.

TNS US has been following the most influential consumers for 17 years, with its survey having collected information from more than 20 million consumers across 30 countries.

Survey results in the UK and the US have shown a similar trend, with women in the US and UK being far superior to men in their familiarity with brands.

The study has also revealed that Britons are more brand loyal than Americans, with Britons being more likely to buy the same brand for all occasions and on all occasions.

“As consumers become more brand aware and discerning, fashion brands will need to develop a deeper understanding of what drives consumer engagement across multiple touchpoints in order to connect with their audiences in a relevant and meaningful way,” said Eva Lee, chief executive officer of TNS US.

“The research shows that fashion brands need to work harder to understand their audiences in order to build strong relationships with them. This will assist in gaining a deeper understanding of their consumers, which will enable the brands to develop a strong understanding of the type of content their consumers want and are willing to engage with.”

The invention relates to a method for fabrication of a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a method for fabricating a semiconductor device with a double-metal-gate structure.
2. Description of the Prior Art
With the continuous development of electronic industries, semiconductor fabrication technology has been evolving from the 0.18 μm planar process to the 0.13 μm planar process to the 0.10 μm planar process to the 0.07 μm planar process to the 0.05 μm planar process. Furthermore, the device size is also gradually reduced as the semiconductor fabrication technology develops. Accordingly, the design rule of the semiconductor device also becomes smaller accordingly.
Generally, the device structure of a MOS transistor can be classified into a planar structure and a non-planar structure. For example, the planar structure refers to a device structure in which the channel region of the MOS transistor is formed in a planar region of the substrate, such as the planar structure of the conventional MOS transistor. Meanwhile, the non-planar structure refers to a device structure in which the channel region of the MOS transistor is formed in a non-planar region of the substrate, such as the non-planar structure of the conventional MOS transistor.
With the continuously reducing design rules, the channel length of the MOS transistor has to be reduced accordingly. Accordingly, the conventional planar structure is no longer applicable. Moreover, the non-planar structure has a great advantage of less leakage current. Therefore, it is a trend to develop the non-planar structure in the semiconductor device.
Referring to FIG. 1, a conventional semiconductor device 10 comprises a substrate 12, a first gate 50, a second","A book, a giftcard, a box of chocolates, a bag of candy, a desk plant or a desk decoration",0.50762,0.966711,2.645741,0.977644,0.47945,1.115433,-5.733397960662842

What is photosynthesis?,"o- me

photosynthesis

(hā`pəsī`səns), process of the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in green plants and algae. The process is carried out by specialized cells called chloroplasts, which contain the chlorophyll and other pigments. It is part of the life processes of the plant and animal kingdoms; in the plant kingdom it occurs mainly in the cotyledons of seeds and in the leaves of mature plants.

Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants that is responsible for the green color. The chloroplasts are surrounded by a membrane that is selectively permeable to carbon dioxide, and they contain small amounts of other pigments that are involved in the process of photosynthesis. The reactions that take place in chloroplasts are as follows:

Electrons are transferred from water to the chlorophyll, which contains a pair of electrons in its base, forming a chlorophyll molecule with a positive charge. The electrons are passed to other chlorophyll molecules to form a series of iron-containing compounds called protochlorophylls. The iron-containing compounds are called protochlorophylls because they are formed before the chlorophylls. Protochlorophylls are available to the carbon dioxide formed by the oxidation of water by the chlorophyll. The carbon dioxide is combined with the protochlorophyll in the chloroplast to form chlorophyllide.

The chlorophyllide has a double bond in its structure, and the carbon dioxide is bound more strongly in its nucleus. The chlorophyllide is changed in the chloroplast by the action of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, which is a special enzyme that is part of the process of photosynthesis. The hydrogen atoms of carbon dioxide are added to the carbon atoms of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, forming the compound ribulose bisphosphate.

The double bond of the chlorophyllide is then reduced by NADPH, an enzyme that is also part of the process of photosynthesis. A series of reactions takes place, beginning with the formation of a compound called sedoheptulose bisphosphate. This compound is important in the process of photosynthesis. Another compound, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, is formed from sedoheptulose bisphosphate. The latter compound is important in the process by which the energy of the light is transmitted to the plant. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is converted into the compound glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This compound is converted into the compound py","Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants use carbon dioxide, sunlight and water to create oxygen and energy.",0.318857,0.996006,16.786354,0.985893,0.344813,3.886384,-5.4802021980285645

I told everyone that I was going to put a fake frog in the giant paper plate.

When I put the frog in the paper plate everyone thought I was playing a joke on them.

Last year I made a giant paper plate shaped like a giant banana, then I put a frog on top of the banana.

I got a giant paper plate and put a whole bunch of different colored rubber bands on it. I then told my friends that I was going to make a giant monster out of it.

I got a big piece of paper and folded it in half. I then put a rubber band around the middle of the paper. I put another rubber band on the top and bottom of the paper.

I then made a giant paper plate out of the middle of my folded paper. I then took the rubber bands off of it and put a giant rubber band on the bottom of it and put my friends on the giant paper plate.

I then went to a park and put my giant paper plate on a branch in the middle of a tree.

Explain nuclear fission in the voice of Bill Nye," on NPR, and
he really was the perfect person for this
job.
He was a science guy and he was also, he
knew his way around a keyboard and he was
really good at it.
He was a great choice.
So, why did I come to NPR?
Well, I came to NPR as a producer for the
Science Friday program.
I was really encouraged by the program to
come to NPR.
There are a lot of great programs on the
radio and I got to work with people who really
care about this stuff.
And it was a great place to learn.
So, I took a few months off to do this show.
And I came back to work for Science Friday
and I have been absolutely thrilled to be
a part of it ever since.
I have a couple other things I’m working
on in the next few months, but right now I’m
just really happy to be on Science Friday.
Science Friday is a great program and it really
is a great place to learn about science.
And now I’m trying to talk about something
that is a lot of fun but I’m not very good
at it.
So, if you’re not familiar with the show,
let me tell you a little bit about it.
I host a weekly science show called Science
Friday, and it’s a show where we talk about
science news that you should know about.
You know, stuff that is important, but what
is cool and new and fun.
It’s a show where I talk to scientists
and other interesting people about new scientific
discoveries, new technologies that are changing
our world and they’re also changing our
lives.
And so I talk to people who are doing things
like trying to bring clean water to our planet
or trying to create more fuel from carbon
dioxide.
I talk to people who are creating tools to
help us see deep into the ocean or how we
could use some of the oldest medicine to help
us heal.
And it’s a really fun show.
And if you’d like to give it a listen to,
you can find out how you can do that on our
website.
And if you’d like to go to our website and
give it a listen, you can find it at sciencefriday.org.
","Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.

In some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise",0.846373,0.936793,8.370319,0.77093,0.898639,2.364611,-6.328600883483887

1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to a method for producing a glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure.
2. Description of the Prior Art
A glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure has been produced by a method in which a glass melt is heated and an amorphous phase is formed from the melt, followed by drawing a fiber. The glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure has various advantages, such as a low coefficient of linear thermal expansion, high resistance to the temperature change, low dielectric constant, and the like.
As a method for producing a glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure, Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 58-32463 discloses a method in which a glass melt is heated and transformed into a melt having a beta-spiral structure by a fiber-drawing process to produce a glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure.
In the method of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 58-32463, a glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure can be produced. However, the glass fiber having a fine crystalline structure has a high linear thermal expansion coefficient and is not suitable for use in a dielectric fiber cord, because the",Caesar was killed on the Ides of March in 44 BC,0.277729,0.990161,12.128221,0.996214,0.257725,2.93001,-6.409979343414307
What are the best woods for smoking?,", in the course of a single day you can make a fire that will last all night. Often, though, you may find yourself with a large quantity of wood that you must cut and split. The following list of woods is just a starting point. There are other woods that will give you the same results, and others that will give you a different result.

white pine. This is the most common wood for smoking meat. It is available in all sizes—small, medium, and large—and is easily split. It is very similar to white oak in its flavor and smoke properties. It has the least amount of tannin.

white oak. This wood is very similar to white pine. It has a light, sweet flavor and is easily split. Unlike white pine, it has more tannin.

black spruce. This is the most hardy of the softwoods, and its wood is the hardest of the hardwoods. It has a light, sweet flavor, and can be used for smoking.

redwood. This is an excellent hardwood for smoking. It has a very light flavor and is easily split.

sugar maple. Sugar maple is a hardwood that is very similar to white pine, but it has more tannin.

willow. Willow is a very hardwood and is especially good for smoking. It is very light in flavor, and it splits easily.

white ash. Ash is a hardwood, but it is very easy to split. It has a light, sweet flavor and can be used for smoking.

	- Best Meat to Smoke: Lamb, beef, brisket, and sausages
	  
Hickory is the most versatile choice as it can be used to smoke wood in many ways. Be careful, though, because too much hickory flavor will cause your meat to have a more bitter flavor. It has a sweet, savory, and hearty, a bit bacony.
	- Best Meat to Smoke: Larger cuts of ribs and pork shoulders, as well as almost all red meat and poultry.
	  
Maple is one of the most subtle smoking wood, it will impart a more subtle smoke flavor.  Use maple for a sweet, light, mild smokiness.

The second movie is the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and loved it. It is the original so it always gets a lot of credit for being the first of the movie series.

I am interested in seeing the older versions of these movies. I have always had a love for horror movies. I can say I have seen every Halloween movie but The Stepfather (I am making my way through the series). I also love Italian horror movies.

Where did Sly and the Family Stone come from?," was born in the small town of DeKalb, Illinois, on April 29, 1962. His parents were both high school teachers, and his father was a minister. His father was a jazz pianist, and his mother was a teacher of children with learning disabilities.

Sly was a member of the DeKalb High School basketball team, but his real passion was music. He wrote songs, produced records, and played the drums and the guitar. His mother once told him, ""You can play any instrument you want to play, but you can't sing."" He realized this was true. He also realized that he did not want to sing. He wanted to write songs.

After graduating high school in the late 1970s, Sly moved to San Francisco to be with his mother. In the very first town he lived in, Sly wrote some of his first songs. He traveled the country by bus and hitchhiked, sleeping on the floor of friends' houses. He worked odd jobs, such as washing dishes and delivering newspapers, and he eventually found a job in retail.

In a 1988 interview with _Rolling Stone_ , Sly said, ""Sometimes I'd get fired, and I'd have to go to the unemployment office and get food stamps, and that's when I got my first glimpse of the poverty out here.""

In the mid-1980s, Sly and his friends formed a band called the 'Fabulous Thunderbirds.' He began to write some of his songs. He was encouraged by his friends, and they started a band, the Stone City Band.

In the summer of 1991, Sly, his father, and his mother moved to the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. They lived in a two-bedroom apartment, and Sly worked odd jobs. His parents had a small farm in Arkansas, and they sold vegetables to the local supermarket. Sly and his family came from a long line of musicians.

Sly and the Family Stone was formed in the summer of 1991. He recruited his friends from high school, and the band played at a local club. They played a few songs. Sly's father didn't like the sound of the band, but Sly's mother loved it. I'm sure his dad just wanted to see his son in a band. Sly had no idea what he was getting into. He didn't realize that Warner Brothers Records had heard the band and wanted them to record.

I was researching cocktails for a large catering event and came across a recipe for a Manhattan that was published in a cocktail book in the early 1900s. I was intrigued by the recipe and it immediately became one of my favorites. I think it's a really great cocktail and balanced, and the ingredients are easy to find right now.

2. Manhattan III: I love this one. This recipe was passed down from my grandfather, who worked in a bar in the late 1800s. It's a simple recipe with a wonderful history behind it.

3. Manhattan IV: My favorite Manhattan recipe is this one. It's a bit more complicated, but I think that makes it better. It's a great cocktail that I think is the most well-known recipe.The present invention relates generally to the field of data storage systems, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for error correction of data stored in a data storage system.
In a typical data storage system, incoming data is read from a storage medium and written, or xe2x80x9cstoredxe2x80x9d, to the medium. The data is typically stored in a number of discrete blocks, with each block containing a predetermined number of bytes.
The data storage system may include a host interface which receives the data from a host computer system and converts the data from the format required by the host to the format required by the storage medium. The data storage system may also include a logical unit (LU) interface, which receives data from the host interface and stores the data in a buffer. The data is later read from the buffer and written to the storage medium.
For most data storage systems, a small number of errors in the data may not result in a noticeable effect. However, as the number of errors increases, the effect on the data storage system becomes more noticeable. For example, a single error in a data block may not be noticeable, but a single error in an entire data storage system may result in the loss of the entire data storage system.
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for","A Manhattan is a cocktail that can be made with either bourbon or rye.  I prefer using rye due to the extra spicy and peppery flavors of the rye enhancing the drink.  For the drink, mix two ounces of rye with one ounce of sweet vermouth in a cocktail shaker.  Add 2 dashes of bitters to the mix.  Add ice, cap the shaker, and shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds.  Uncap the shaker and pour the Manhattan into a glass.

Here’s a link to a video describing a Net Zero energy home built in Massachusetts. It is a wonderful video.

“… my interest in Net Zero energy homes is not just about climate change or even just about sustainability. I have been interested in design and energy use for a long time. In fact, now that I have written the book, the two interests have become one. The ideas in the book, and the Net Zero energy home I have designed, are interrelated. …”

“I strongly believe that Net Zero Energy homes are not only possible, but also necessary. The goal of Net Zero Energy Homes is to have no net energy used in a home. This means no carbon emissions. It also means no water usage. The house is designed to use no water, and no electricity except what is needed for the basic functions of the home. …”

“I have designed and built several Net Zero energy homes as well as a Net Zero energy home for my daughter. I have been a designer, builder, and builder-owner of net zero energy homes for over 15 years.

Who finished the Wheel of Time series?,"el

I finished the Wheel of Time series today. I know the ending wasn't what I was expecting, but I'm glad it was the way it was. I liked the characters, the world-building, and the magic. I know the books are made up, but they were written in a way that made them seem real. I enjoyed the way the characters were developed over the course of the series, and I'm glad I read them.

But I'm not sure if I'll continue on with the series. I don't want to read the rest of the series, but I also don't want to stop. I think I'll have to just pick and choose what I want to read next. I'm curious to see what happens next.

The United Nations has opened an emergency session of its General Assembly on the world's deepening humanitarian crisis in Syria and the collapse of peace talks. The meeting, which is taking place in New York on Monday, is the first of its kind since the crisis erupted nearly five years ago.

On Monday, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced the establishment of a ""High-level Panel on Humanitarian Access"" to assess how the international community can help the millions of people around the world who are on the brink of starvation.

The panel will be chaired by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and will include UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock, and former UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast.

""Civilians are trapped, unable to leave their homes, and suffering the consequences of their government's indiscriminate use of force,"" Ban said in a statement.

Over the past few weeks, the Syrian regime and its Russian ally have intensified their bombing campaign in opposition-held areas of the country.

The UN has reported a surge in civilian casualties and the number of refugees crossing into neighboring countries has doubled in the past few months.

Which parts do people train on the upper body?,". We have people training in different styles of training, but I think it’s not the same thing.

We’re training on the same movements, but we’re using different principles. We’re looking to isolate a movement and then go back and make the movement more stable.

What are some of the key principles that you guys are adapting?

One of the main things is to focus on a small range of motion and then go back and make it larger.

As an example, a lot of people train on moving their hands in a full circle. They get really strong, but then they’re not training to do a full circle. They’re just doing one finger. The same finger is doing the same movement over and over.

So we’re training on moving your hand up and down, but we’re focusing it on one finger. We’re looking for a small range of motion, then going back and making it bigger.

Another principle is to keep your head up. Keep your head up and look at the ceiling, look at the floor. You’re looking at the floor, then the ceiling. Not looking at the top of your head.

We’re looking for the fact that we’re looking at the floor, then looking at the ceiling. Your head is in a neutral position, and then we’re looking at the floor, then the ceiling.

As a coach, what are your thoughts on the new generation of coaches?

I think the new generation of coaches is excited about training people and helping people. I think they’re excited about working with people and helping people.

I think they’re excited about bringing those people, who are not into fitness, into the gym. They’re excited about helping them and bringing them into the gym.

What’s the biggest misconception about CrossFit?

I think people think that we’re just jumping around and doing a lot of different exercises.

But CrossFit is really focused on stability. There are a lot of people who do CrossFit because they want to get stronger and stronger. But CrossFit is really focused on the stability of the movement, and the workout that you do.

It’s not really about the jumping in and out. It’s about the movements.

The other thing is that people think that CrossFit is a very intense workout.

How did the end of the war affect the climate of the Pacific islands?

How did the end of the war affect the climate of the Pacific islands?

How did the end of the war affect the climate of the Pacific islands?

This question is part of an assignment for the British Museum. I am unsure of how to go about it. Does anyone have any ideas?

A:

The end of the war was not necessarily a major factor in the climate of the Pacific islands, and it depended on what area the islands were located in, and how far to the front lines the islanders had been evacuated.
The islands of the Pacific Ocean, the Pacific islands, and the world climate were affected by World War II, even though it was not fought in that part of the world.
The main effect of the war was the loss of life. The major causes of death in the Pacific islands were not the war itself, but malnutrition, disease, and malaria. The war did not affect the climate of the Pacific islands, but it did have an effect on the people of the Pacific islands, who were heavily affected by the war.
Some of the Pacific islands, such as the islands of Vanuatu, were not on the front lines of the war, and the people of these islands did not suffer as much as the people of the islands that were on the front lines.
The climate of the Pacific islands was controlled by the trade winds. The trade winds, which blow from the northeast at about 20 miles per hour, swept the Pacific islands in a clockwise direction. This prevented the islands from being too hot, and the trade winds also prevented the islands from being too cold. The trade winds also prevented the islands from being too dry or too wet. The trade winds were the same in all of the Pacific islands. The trade winds are only broken by monsoon winds, which are weak. The monsoons only blow on the western islands of the Pacific.
The trade winds changed the climate of the Pacific islands by creating a climate that was consistent, which made it easier to farm the islands. The trade winds kept the islands moist, which allowed the farmers to grow rice. Rice is the main food in the Pacific islands. The trade winds also helped the farmers to grow a lot of food. The trade winds also made it easy",The main treaty that marked the end of World War I was the Treaty of Versailles.,0.338516,0.99776,9.246654,0.951019,0.365718,2.379933,-4.300962448120117

The second approach is a heuristic approach. This approach is based on the search of the best solution by trial and error.

What are the two approaches to the problem of optimisation?

The two approaches to the problem of optimisation are the direct method and the heuristic method. The direct method is based on the theory of calculus. The heuristic method is based on the search of the best solution by trial and error.

What is used in the direct method of approach to problem of optimisation?

The direct method of approach to problem of optimisation is used in the theory of calculus. This method is based on the application of calculus to the equation of optimisation.

What is used in the heuristic method of approach to problem of optimisation?

The heuristic method of approach to problem of optimisation is used in the search of the best solution by trial and error. This method is applied to the equation of optimisation by trial and error.

What is the difference between the direct method and the heuristic method of approach to problem of optimisation?

The difference between the direct method and the heuristic method of approach to problem of optimisation is that in the former a solution is considered to be a best solution, while in the latter a solution is considered to be a good solution.

What is meant by solution by trial and error?

In the heuristic method of approach to problem of optimisation, the solution is considered to be a good solution if it is the best solution found by trial and error.

What is meant by a best solution?

A best solution is a solution that is the best solution found by trial and error.

What is meant by the best solution?

The best solution is the solution that is the best solution found by trial and error.

What is meant by a good solution?

A good solution is a solution that is not the best solution found by trial and error.

What is meant by an optimal solution?

An optimal solution is a solution that is the best solution found by trial and error.

What is a feasible solution?

A feasible solution is","In mathematics and computer science, an optimisation problem is typically a search problem in which the best solution is to locate among all feasible solutions. An optimisation problem can be categorised as continuous or discrete depending on the type of their variables. In a discrete optimisation problem, variables are discrete and countable. In contrast, continuous variables include infinitely uncountable values, for example, a variable over a non-empty range of real numbers. 

According to the number of objective functions, an optimisation problem is classified as single or multi-objective. A single-objective optimisation problem only involves one objective function to optimise. On the other hand, a multi-objective one considers two or more objectives simultaneously, which means the interaction between objectives has to be considered.",0.372433,0.991224,27.100559,0.98548,0.448957,5.97973,-5.523758411407471

What are some plants you can put in your outdoor garden to keep the bugs away?,"k?

A:

There are a lot of plants that are fairly hardy and which also seem to repel bugs, I would suggest starting with a few of the ones below, as they are all fairly easy to grow and might be a good introduction to the world of gardening:

Lavender

Chives

Strawberries

Fennel

Cabbage

Rosemary

Tarragon

Lemon thyme

Basil

Spinach

Peas

Carrots

Lettuce

I've heard that parsley, oregano, and sage all work well, too.  You can also try a mixture of several, or even just one or two of the above.

Who are the main songwriters for the Grateful Dead?,", I think I would lean towards Weir. I don't know much about Weir's songwriting, but the constant repetition of certain riffs/melodies in their songs, as well as the tempo changes and the lead guitar solo work, which is something that I'd like to see in a Dead song, seem to suggest that he might be the guy.

I don't think it's that obvious, though. His two or three main songwriters include Bob Weir, Phil Lesh (who contributed a lot to the Grateful Dead's first two albums), and Bill Kreutzmann. I think it's likely that Weir is the main songwriter of the Grateful Dead, but I don't know the extent to which he contributed to the songwriting of the Dead.

I don't know if you've ever listened to the Dead's music from the early years. It's very, very repetitive, and many of the songs have the same basic chord structures and melodies. I don't know if you're familiar with the Beatles' song ""Norwegian Wood"" and the Rolling Stones' song ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" but you could apply a lot of the same concepts to them, because they're both very repetitive in their chord structures and melodies.

The Grateful Dead began their career in the late '60s, and their music has always had this enormous amount of repetitiveness to it.

It's true that most of the music in the Grateful Dead's repertoire is repetitive, but I think that you have to look at it in the context of the times. The Grateful Dead were playing a lot of songs that were very complicated and difficult to play, and most of the songs were quite similar in structure and melody. I think that the Grateful Dead were doing this to show off their musicianship and to prove that they could play all kinds of complicated songs, which I think they did.

I don't think that the Grateful Dead was trying to copy the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. I think that they were making music that they wanted to play, and that they didn't want to play songs that were a lot simpler because they enjoyed playing the more complicated songs.

The Grateful Dead were playing a lot of songs that were very complicated and difficult to play, and most of the songs were quite similar in structure and melody.

I've done a lot of work with varying sizes of groups, and I've learned that it's the groups that do the work that learn the most. I've also seen that it's the groups that struggle the most that ultimately learn the most.

A lot of people are new to the concept of learning and want to know why you wouldn't just read the lesson yourself. One big reason is that it takes a lot of energy to read a lesson. Other reasons are that it's often hard to find a good place to share the lessons, and the concept of lesson sharing makes a lot of people uncomfortable.

At this point in the program, I'm not sure what the best way to approach lesson sharing is. I'm open to hearing ideas, so keep them coming!

When I started the program, I did a lot of reading. I've since learned that one of the best ways to learn a skill is to teach it to someone else. In fact, I've gotten so good at teaching that I've started to dislike reading.

As I've gotten better at teaching, I've realized that the best way to learn is to be a student. However, it's easy to get stuck in the mindset of being a teacher. I've found that it's the students that learn the most when they take the time to learn from each other.

One way I get out of the teaching mindset is to try to learn by teaching. This means that I try to teach my lessons to the people I teach. I've found that the best way to learn a skill is to teach it to someone else.

"Can you write a brief summary for the book ""Braving the Wilderness"" by Brene Brown?"," can you write a brief summary for the book ""Braving the Wilderness"" by Brene Brown?

Answer

Answer:

Hi,

Thanks for writing to us.

In my book, “Braving the Wilderness”, I talk about how to have a healthy relationship with ourselves, others, and life in general.

I discuss how we tend to hold onto painful emotions and experiences in order to avoid going through the pain of loss.

I believe that it is important to embrace the pain, instead of avoiding it.

In this book I also talk about how to create a life that is filled with meaning and purpose.

I believe that when we live a life that is filled with meaning, we will have a life that is filled with joy and happiness.

I hope that you enjoyed reading my book.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Regards,

Karin

Answer:

Hi,

I read your book ""Braving the Wilderness"" and it really helped me. I was telling my friend about it and she said that the part about the butterfly and the caterpillar was really interesting and she learned something from it.

I really enjoyed reading it and I am happy that I do not have to go through the process of death like that. I am not sure if I will be able to read it again but I hope that you will write another book about it.

All the best!

Answer:

Thanks for writing to us.

Yes, Braving the Wilderness does deal with death and is based on some of the experiences that I have had.

I am glad that it helped you and that you enjoyed reading it.

I would love to write another book and I am sure that it will be a subject that will be very meaningful to others who read it.

I look forward to hearing from you soon!

Karin

Answer:

I have just finished your book ""Braving the Wilderness"". It is brilliant and has helped me a lot. I am trying to comprehend the idea that death is a transition and not a permanent state.

I would be interested in hearing more of your opinions about how people can move through the stages of grief and how they can relate to the idea of death.

A core idea is that if you are courageous enough to stand alone in the name of the virtues and values you believe in, you can actually create more belonging for others.

Name a few popular metal genres," by Korn (central European thrash), Slipknot (hardcore), and Rammstein (heavy industrial).

The band is named after the New York City Fire Department's Engine Company 68, the first of the five companies of the FDNY to respond to the World Trade Center disaster of September 11, 2001, and the name was chosen by a fan contest (ensuring the band would not be confused with the New York City Police Department). The band's name is also a play on the phrase ""artificial fire"". The lyrics of the song ""F.E.A.R."" (from their self-titled album) are about a fictional character named Frederick E. Andrews, who goes by the name of Fireman Ed.

The band has been compared to Nine Inch Nails, Slayer, Metallica, and Korn, as well as to the early work of Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Metallica.

Career

The band began in 2001 under the name The Artificial Fire, but when their first album was released, they decided to change their name. In the spring of 2003, the band released their debut album, which was a big success in the metal community. The band mainly played throughout the Northeast and New England and have toured the United States and Europe. In June 2006, a rumor circulated that the band would be going on a hiatus. However, the band ended this rumor in October 2006 when they released their second album, titled Resist. A few years later, they released their third album, titled Unleashed.

The band has also released a song for the soundtrack of the video game The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria.

On February 26, 2008, the band released a song titled ""F.E.A.R."" as a free download.  The song was later made available for purchase on iTunes on March 6, 2008.

On February 26, 2009, the band released a song titled ""F.E.A.R."", written as a tribute to the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The song was later made available for purchase on iTunes.

When did Delaware join the United States?,"en: I don't know, but I do know that in 1803, when the United States bought out the English from the state of Delaware (from which they'd been expelled after the Revolutionary War, when the English had lost and the Dutch had won). Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution after the First Amendment was ratified in 1791. So those were the facts.

""Why do you think it's funny to be a tough guy for the government? Is it because you are a big meanie when you don't get your way, or is it because you know it's not always right?""

I don't think it's funny to be a tough guy for the government. I don't think it's funny to be a tough guy for the government.

I think it's funny when people in the government are tough guys.

""If you were a member of the Delaware legislature, which one of the following would you be most likely to be?""

hwb: Charlie Brown. I would have a terrible headache when I would have to listen to everybody talk. I'd be a great legislator, but I don't think I could do it.

""Aren't you supposed to support the poor and the hungry?""

hwb: I'm a big supporter of the underdog. I do believe that if you come from a poor background, you're better off than if you come from a wealthy background. I don't think that I would be a good legislator because I don't think I would be able to make the right decisions. I would be a terrible legislator.

""Would you rather be a lawyer or a doctor?""

hwb: If I had to choose one over the other, I'd pick a doctor.

""Why do you think they call them 'federal laws'?""

hwb: Because the federal government makes them and they're federal.

""Do you think they should have a gun?""

hwb: No.

""Why not?""

hwb: Because it's a lethal weapon.

Give me an idea of some cold beverages to drink on a hot day," to the beach

when you are having a bad day, are you looking for some cold beverages to drink on a hot day or are you looking for some entertainment to do? I am sure everyone has a bad day. I know I have had many bad days.

Recently I have been having a bad day because of some issues that are going on in my life. I am not at all happy with the way things are going in my life and I am just as upset as when I was little. If I could change things, I would.

I remember the day I learned to walk. I remember all the training and patience I had to have with myself to get the training right. Sometimes I think I forget how hard it was. I am just not that patient when I have a bad day.

I am going to be honest with you, I am not patient when I have a bad day. I am not patient when I am upset, even if it is just a little upset. I get mad. I get frustrated.

I want to know how to be patient when I am having a bad day.

I am not talking about being patient about going to work. I am talking about being patient when you are having a bad day. I am not talking about being angry. I am talking about being patient.

I am not all for being bitter with others, I am just saying I am not patient when I am upset. I want to know how to be patient and how to be patient when I am having a bad day.

Where was Anne Zohra Berrached born?," up her background.

So where were we?

Anne Zohra Berrached was born in the early 1960s in a suburban house in Sydney, Australia, during the last gasp of the British Empire. No one knows exactly when she was born or when she died, but her birth and death certificates give a rough date of birth in December 1960.

She was born in a time when the British Empire was in decline and the Cold War was raging between the United States and the Soviet Union. Anne was born into the middle class. Her father, Wassim, was a Lebanese immigrant who had been a merchant marine and whose family came from a village in Syria. Her mother, Zohra, was a classically trained pianist who had emigrated from Lebanon. She was raised in a middle class household and was the eldest of four children.

Anne Zohra Berrached was a fund-raiser for the Labor Party. Her family was too poor to be able to give her a private education and she attended a Catholic convent school. She moved to Sydney for university and then worked for the Labor Party for several years.

Anne Zohra Berrached married Mohamad Berrached in the late 1970s. He was a Lebanese engineer and an Australian citizen. He was a man of high culture and literature; he had majored in chemistry at the University of Sydney and had been a maths teacher. He had been a member of the Labor Party for many years.

At the time of their marriage, Mohamad Berrached was working for a company called the Airline Printing Company. He had been a member of the Labor Party for many years and was a devoted and active supporter. Anne Zohra Berrached always said that her marriage was a happy one and that she loved her husband deeply. They had no children.

What happened in the years after the marriage?

Anne Zohra Berrached left Australia in the late 1980s and went to Beirut, Lebanon, where she worked for the International Development and Relief Agency. She served in Beirut for several years, and then moved to the United States. She became the director of another development agency in the United States and left that position after a few years to become a fund-raiser for the Labor Party. She was well known in the Labor Party and was well respected by her colleagues.

Definition and history of the term ‘physiography’

Physiography, from the Greek words of ‘physika’ (nature) and ‘graphein’ (to write), is the study of the natural features of places.

Physiographers were the first to compile maps of the physical features of a place.

The term ‘physiography’ is often used to mean the study of the shape, structure and function of the earth, though the modern term is often used to describe the study of the physical features of a place, or of the ways in which people use it.

Physiography has a long and complex history.

Some of the earliest known maps are a series of maps of the world made by the Greek philosopher Strabo (63 BC – AD 24), who was a student of the famous Roman geographer Ptolemy.

The first known map of the world was a map drawn by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus (fl. c. 670 BC) in the Ionian city of Miletus.

The word ‘geography’ is derived from the Latin word ‘geographia’ (meaning ‘pictures of the world’). The word ‘geography’ was coined by the Greek geographer Strabo.

Medieval ‘world maps’ were used to describe the natural features of the world, such as the shape of the earth’s circumference, and the relative position of the continents.

The word ‘geography’ was used to describe the study of the natural features of the earth, such as the shape of the earth’s circumference and the relative position of the continents.

The word ‘geography’ was used to describe the study of the natural features of the earth, such as the shape of the earth’s circumference and the relative position of the continents.

The word ‘cosmography’ was used to describe the study of the physical features of the universe, such as the shape of the universe’s circumference and the relative position of the heavenly bodies.

The word ‘physiography’ was coined by the French philosopher René Thom in the 1950s.

Is it acceptable to sign a cappella (without musical accompaniment) at a community musical theater audition?,"I am a new member of a community theater. When I was applying to perform with them, I was told that I needed to be a part of the theater's a cappella group. I have been singing for nearly a year, and have been taking private classes for about a year and a half. I know some of the songs and have been practicing, but I feel like I don't have enough to sing for them. Is it acceptable to sing without accompaniment at a community theater audition?

A:

I think there is a spectrum of ""acceptable,"" but I'd say that it depends on how far the auditioners are willing to go.  If the auditioners are not going to have a professional accompanist, I'd say that it is acceptable.  If there is going to be an accompanist, I'd say that it is not acceptable.
First, I'd say that if you are singing well enough to open auditions for a community theater (that you are able to successfully audition for), then you should be able to sing the songs of the auditioners.  There are no prerequisite musical skills for performing a cappella.  So if you can sing the auditioners' songs well enough, then you should be able to sing them well enough for the auditioners to want to hire you.
Second, I'd say that if you are singing well enough to open auditions for a community theater (that you are able to successfully audition for), then you should be able to sing the auditioners' songs with some kind of accompaniment (accompaniment that you are able to play yourself, or accompaniment that you are able to have someone else play for you).  The rehearsal time for open auditions is very limited, so it makes sense for the auditioners to want as much rehearsal time as possible.  If you are able to sing a song well enough that the auditioners want to hire you, then it makes sense to them that you can sing the song with some kind of accompaniment.
Third, if you are singing well enough to open auditions for a community theater and you can sing the auditioners' songs with accompaniment, then it seems to me that they should be able to hire you.  But if you are singing well enough to open auditions for a community theater and you can sing the auditioners' songs without accompaniment, then it seems to me that they should not hire you.  It is a good sign that the auditioners","No, this is usually not considered acceptable. Auditioners for local, community musical theater are usually expected to provide sheet music -- clearly marked with their specific cut of the material -- for the audition accompanist. This may be a physical, printed copy of the music, or an electronic version provided on a tablet computer such as an iPad. In some cases, the company holding the auditions may also allow you to play recorded accompaniment at the audition.

You know, it's not a hairy animal. It's a very strong animal. And when they're walking through the snow, I mean, you don't want to get hit by a grizzly bear. So you want to make sure you have some protection for yourself.

And so, you know, a lot of people are putting on hand warmers, because grizzlies are very active in the winter. They're very lazy and they like to sleep a lot in the winter. So you want to make sure you have something for yourself. Now -- and of course, for all of you who are traveling in the winter, particularly in grizzly country, I would recommend wearing ski pants and a jacket, because when a grizzly bear walks through the snow you want to be as warm as possible from your body heat.

12:09:29

NNAMDIAnd can you wear boots?

12:09:30

BOSERYes. That's definitely a good idea.

12:09:32

NNAMDIHow about gloves?

12:09:33

BOSERAbsolutely.

12:09:34

NNAMDIHow about hat?

12:09:35

BOSERAbsolutely.

12:09:36

NNAMDIWhat about a jacket?

12:09:37

BOSERAbsolutely.

12:09:38

NNAMDIAnd what about a scarf?

12:09:40

BOSERAbsolutely. And a scarf is very important. You know, in the winter, you want to keep your face, your neck, your hands warm. And the scarf is really great because it kind of helps you, too. So if you've got a hat on, a scarf on, and your mittens on, you're really good to go.

12:09:56

NNAMDIYou mentioned a lot of things that you think people should be wearing. What else do you think people should think about?

12:09:59

BOSERWell, I think that when you're in bear country, you should be carrying","None, they have bear feet!",0.268814,0.983223,15.006477,0.973862,0.317495,3.509974,-8.08094310760498

I.e. is it correct to assume that N would be in the range 0.5 to 2.0 if the inputs were drawn from a normal distribution?

A:

We can use a Monte Carlo approach to answer your question. 
Random variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be independent if the probability that $X$
is less than $x$ and $Y$ is less than $y$ is independent of $x$ and $y$. This property holds if $X$ and $Y$ are independent random variables.
In your case, we can assume $N$ is a random variable, $X$ is the number of trials and $Y$ is the number of answers that are correct.
The probability that $X$ is less than $x$ and $Y$ is less than $y$ is given by the following expression:
$$Pr(X \leq x, Y \leq y) = Pr(X \leq x) \times Pr(Y \leq y)$$
The probability $Pr(X \leq x)$ is your desired probability for $0 \leq x \leq 2$.
The probability $Pr(Y \leq y)$ is your desired probability for $0 \leq y \leq 2$.
In your case,
$$Pr(X \leq 0.5, Y \leq 0.5) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times Pr(Y \leq 0.5) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times (1 - Pr(Y \leq 0.5)) = 0.5 \times (1 - 0.5) = 0.25$$
$$Pr(X \leq 0.5, Y \leq 1) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times Pr(Y \leq 1) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times Pr(Y \leq 1) = 0.5 \times (1 - 0.5) = 0.25$$
$$Pr(X \leq 0.5, Y \leq 2) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times Pr(Y \leq 2) = Pr(X \leq 0.5) \times Pr(Y","Sometimes it is, while other times it may contain errors or deliberately misquoted.",0.136468,0.981289,4.191177,0.943626,0.143106,1.279133,-8.513317108154297
