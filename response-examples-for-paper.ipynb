For DVDs, Netflix could predict that people would continue to want to own physical DVDs and that the market for streaming video would be limited. However, with streaming video, there is no \"middleman\" to charge extra for: Netflix is the middleman, and it is providing the streaming video service. Therefore, Netflix needs to worry about keeping streaming video services free or close to free, because there is no \"cost\" to the middleman. The middleman fees are for DVDs, where there is a middleman. Therefore, Netflix should rethink its strategy for streaming video and think more like a traditional company, in which the streaming video service is a loss-leader to attract customers to the DVDs business.',\n",

       "        'The book \"Principles: The Art of Business Achievement\" by Ray Dalio is a collection of his teachings on leadership, wealth creation, and business success. The book is divided into six sections, each of which focuses on a different principle that Dalio believes is essential for business success.\\n\\n1. The First Principle: Success Comes from Failure\\nIn this section, Dalio discusses the importance of failure in the pursuit of success. He argues that success comes not from avoiding failure, but rather from learning from it and using it to improve oneself. Dalio suggests that successful individuals and businesses are often those that have failed in the past, as they are able to learn from their mistakes and build upon their experiences to achieve even greater success.\\n\\n2. The Second Principle: Money Is a Social Construct\\nIn this section, Dalio discusses the role of money in business and the importance of managing money effectively. He argues that money is not the primary driver of success, but rather a tool that can be used to support and enable success. Dalio suggests that successful individuals and businesses are often those that have a strong understanding of money and financial management, and are able to use money to support their goals and objectives.\\n\\n3. The Third Principle: You Are Limits\\nIn this section, Dalio discusses the importance of setting limits on what you are willing to sacrifice for success. He argues that successful individuals and businesses are often those that are willing to set boundaries and make sacrifices in order to achieve their goals and objectives. Dalio suggests that successful individuals and businesses are often those that are able to set clear limits on their time, energy, and resources, and are able to prioritize their activities to achieve their goals.\\n\\n4. The Fourth Principle: Leading a Community\\nIn this section, Dalio discusses the importance of leading a community in the pursuit of success. He argues that successful individuals and businesses are often those that are able to create a community of supporters, customers, and employees that are passionate about their products or services. Dalio suggests that successful individuals and businesses are often those that are able to create a sense of belonging and connection within their community, and are able to use this to motivate and inspire their supporters.\\n\\n5. The Fifth Principle: Master the Process\\nIn this section, Dalio discusses the importance of mastering the process of business and creating systems and structures that can be used to achieve success.

It matches the beginning of a line that contains a query string, and captures the query string as a group named `$queryString` in the `$matches` variable.\\n\\nThe script then iterates over the filtered lines and appends each line to the output text file. When it reaches a line that matches the query string, it appends a newline character to the output text file and then captures the remainder of the line as a string.\\n\\nFinally, the script uses the `New-Item` cmdlet to create a new text file with the output of the script as its contents.\\n\\nNote that this script assumes that the access log file is in the path specified in the script, and that the text file is in the same directory as the script.

In this case, the victory over the rival faction, which represents the Shadow Kin's internal conflict, represents the ultimate victory over their internal conflicts and their external enemies.\\n\\nOverall, this alternative ending for the movie is a hopeful\",\n",
